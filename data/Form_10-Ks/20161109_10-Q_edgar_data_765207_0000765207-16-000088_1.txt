Item 1   Financial Statements 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
  The First Bancorp, Inc. 
    
  We have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated financial information of The First Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and for the three-month and nine-month periods then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
  We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is to express an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
  Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying  interim consolidated financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
  The First Bancorp, Inc. ("the Company") is a financial holding company that owns all of the common stock of First National Bank ("the Bank"). The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The income reported for the   2016   period is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Subsequent Events 
  Events occurring subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , have been evaluated as to their potential impact to the financial statements.

The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of investment securities at   September 30, 2015  : 

At   September 30, 2016  , securities with a fair value of   $249,162,000   were pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, and for other purposes as required by law. This compares to securities with a fair value of   $201,879,000   as of   December 31, 2015   and   $221,072,000   at   September 30, 2015  , pledged for the same purposes. 
  Gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are computed by subtracting the amortized cost at the time of sale from the security's selling price, net of accrued interest to be received. The following table shows securities gains and losses for the   nine months   and quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Management reviews securities with unrealized losses for other than temporary impairment. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   71   securities with unrealized losses held in the Company's portfolio. These securities were temporarily impaired as a result of changes in interest rates reducing their fair value, of which   13   had been temporarily impaired for   12   months or more. At the present time, there have been no material changes in the credit quality of these securities resulting in other than temporary impairment, and in Management's opinion, no additional write-down for other-than-temporary impairment is warranted. Information regarding securities temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   is summarized below: 

As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   78   securities with unrealized losses held in the Company's portfolio. These securities were temporarily impaired as a result of changes in interest rates reducing their fair value, of which   15   had been temporarily impaired for   12 months   or more. Information regarding securities temporarily impaired as of   December 31, 2015   is summarized below: 

As of   September 30, 2015  , there were   88   securities with unrealized losses held in the Company's portfolio. These securities were temporarily impaired as a result of changes in interest rates reducing their fair value, of which   14   had been temporarily impaired for   12 months   or more. Information regarding securities temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2015   is summarized below: 

During the third quarter of 2014, the Company transferred securities with a total amortized cost of   $89,780,000   with a corresponding fair value of   $89,757,000   from available for sale to held to maturity. The net unrealized loss, net of taxes, on these securities at the date of the transfer was   $15,000  . The net unrealized holding loss at the time of transfer continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and is amortized over the remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment of the yield. The amortization of the net unrealized loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will offset the effect on interest income of the discount for the transferred securities. The  
  
   Page 10 

remaining unamortized balance of the net unrealized losses for the securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity was   $124,000   at   September 30, 2016  . These securities were transferred as a part of the Company's overall investment and balance sheet strategies. 
  The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Boston, a cooperatively owned wholesale bank for housing and finance in the   six   New England States. As a requirement of membership in the FHLB, the Bank must own a minimum required amount of FHLB stock, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. The Bank uses the FHLB for much of its wholesale funding needs. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank's investment in FHLB stock totaled   $13,011,000  ,   $12,875,000   and   $13,220,000  , respectively. FHLB stock is a non-marketable equity security and therefore is reported at cost, which equals par value.  The Company periodically evaluates its investment in FHLB stock for impairment based on, among other factors, the capital adequacy of the FHLB and its overall financial condition. No impairment losses have been recorded through   September 30, 2016  . The Bank will continue to monitor its investment in FHLB stock. 
   
  Note 3   Loans 
  The following table shows the composition of the Company's loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and at   December 31, 2015  : 

Loan balances include net deferred loan costs of   $4,648,000   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $3,686,000   as of   December 31, 2015  , and   $3,452,000   as of   September 30, 2015  . Pursuant to collateral agreements, qualifying first mortgage loans, which totaled   $262,001,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $279,463,000   at   December 31, 2015  , and   $281,925,000   at   September 30, 2015  , were used to collateralize borrowings from the FHLB. In addition, commercial, construction and home equity loans totaling   $261,416,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $243,578,000   at   December 31, 2015  , and   $251,937,000   at   September 30, 2015  , were used to collateralize a standby line of credit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that is currently unused. 
  For all loan classes, loans over 30 days past due are considered delinquent. Information on the past-due status of loans by class of financing receivable as of   September 30, 2016  , is presented in the following table: 

Page 11 

Information on the past-due status of loans by class of financing receivable as of   December 31, 2015  , is presented in the following table:   

  Information on the past-due status of loans by class of financing receivable as of   September 30, 2015  , is presented in the following table: 

For all classes, loans are placed on non-accrual status when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when principal and interest is 90 days or more past due unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection (in which case the loan may continue to accrue interest in spite of its past due status). A loan is "well secured" if it is secured (1) by collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a financially responsible party. A loan is "in the process of collection" if collection of the loan is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or, (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future. 
  
   Page 12 

Cash payments received on non-accrual loans, which are included in impaired loans, are applied to reduce the loan's principal balance until the remaining principal balance is deemed collectible, after which interest is recognized when collected.  As a general rule, a loan may be restored to accrual status when payments are current for a substantial period of time, generally six months, and repayment of the remaining contractual amounts is expected or when it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of collection.  Information on nonaccrual loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and at   December 31, 2015   is presented in the following table: 

Impaired loans include troubled debt restructured and loans placed on non-accrual. These loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure of an impaired loan is lower than the recorded investment in the loan and estimated selling costs, a specific reserve is established for the difference, or, in certain situations, if the measure of an impaired loan is lower than the recorded investment in the loan and estimated selling costs, the difference is written off.

Troubled Debt Restructured 
  A troubled debt restructured ("TDR") constitutes a restructuring of debt if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. To determine whether or not a loan should be classified as a TDR, Management evaluates a loan based upon the following criteria: 
             
    The borrower demonstrates financial difficulty; common indicators include past due status with bank obligations, substandard credit bureau reports, or an inability to refinance with another lender, and 
                
    The Company has granted a concession; common concession types include maturity date extension, interest rate adjustments to below market pricing, and deferment of payments. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   75   loans with a value of   $22,025,000   that have been classified as TDRs. This compares to   84   loans with a value of   $23,923,000   and   88   loans with a value of   $24,715,000   classified as TDRs as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The impairment carried as a specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses is calculated by present valuing the expected cash flows on the loan at the original interest rate, or, for collateral-dependent loans, using the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.   
    
         The following table shows TDRs by class and the specific reserve as of   September 30, 2016  :

Page 17 

The following table shows TDRs by class and the specific reserve as of   September 30, 2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   eight   of the loans classified as TDRs with a total balance of   $1,060,000   were more than   30   days past due.  None of these loans had been placed on TDR status in the previous 12 months. The following table shows these TDRs by class and the associated specific reserves included in the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Page 18 

As of   September 30, 2015  ,   10   of the loans classified as TDRs with a total balance of   $1,593,000   were more than   30   days past due. None of these loans had been placed on TDR status in the previous 12 months. The following table shows these TDRs by class and the associated specific reserves included in the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2015  : 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   no   loans were placed on TDR status.  This compares to   one   loan placed on TDR status with a post-modification outstanding balance of   $108,000   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was considered a TDR because concessions had been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions include reductions in interest rates, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, or combinations thereof. 
  The following table shows loans placed on TDR status in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, by class of loan and the associated specific reserve included in the allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2015: 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016   no   loans were placed on TDR status. This compares to   one   loan placed on TDR status with a post-modification outstanding balance of   $108,000   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. This was considered a TDRs because concessions had been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions include reductions in interest rates, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, or combinations thereof.

The following table shows loans placed on TDR status in the three months ended September 30, 2015, by class of loan and the associated specific reserve included in the allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2015: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , Management is aware of   six   loans classified as TDRs that are involved in bankruptcy with an outstanding balance of   $1,062,000  . There were also   nine   loans with an outstanding balance of   $971,000   that were classified as TDRs and on non-accrual status.   Three   loans with an outstanding balance of   $222,000  , that were classified as TDRs, were in the process of foreclosure. 
  Residential Mortgage Loans in Process of Foreclosure 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   13   mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure with a total balance of $  1,508,000  ; this compares to   18   mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure with a total balance of   $2,038,000   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Note 4. Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The Company provides for loan losses through the establishment of an allowance for loan losses which represents an estimated reserve for existing losses in the loan portfolio. A systematic methodology is used for determining the allowance that includes a quarterly review process, risk rating changes, and adjustments to the allowance. The loan portfolio is classified in   eight   classes and credit risk is evaluated separately in each class. The appropriate level of the allowance is evaluated continually based on a review of significant loans, with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing, past due, and other loans that may require special attention. Other factors include general conditions in local and national economies; loan portfolio composition and asset quality indicators; and internal factors such as changes in underwriting policies, credit administration practices, experience, ability and depth of lending management, among others. The allowance consists of four elements: (1) specific reserves for loans evaluated individually for impairment; (2) general reserves for each portfolio segment based on historical loan loss experience, (3) qualitative reserves judgmentally adjusted for local and national economic conditions, concentrations, portfolio composition, volume and severity of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, trends of criticized and classified loans, changes in credit policies and underwriting standards, credit administration practices, and other factors as applicable for each portfolio segment; and (4) unallocated reserves. All outstanding loans are considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance.

A breakdown of the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , by class of financing receivable and allowance element, is presented in the following tables: 

Page 21 

Qualitative adjustment factors are taken into consideration when determining reserve estimates. These adjustment factors are based upon Management's evaluation of various current conditions, including those listed below. 
             
    General economic conditions. 
                
    Credit quality trends with emphasis on loan delinquencies, nonaccrual levels and classified loans. 
                
    Recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio. 
                
    Loan volumes and concentrations, including changes in mix. 
                
    Other factors, including changes in quality of the loan origination; loan policy changes; changes in credit risk management processes; Bank regulatory and external loan review examination results. 
     The qualitative portion of the allowance for loan losses was   0.46%   of related loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   0.45%   as of   December 31, 2015  . The qualitative portion increased   $253,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   due to an increase in loans outstanding. Due to the increased commercial loan volume this year and potential weaknesses in a small number of credits which are currently performing, the Company is carrying a   $1,000,000   overlay in pooled reserves. 
  The unallocated component of the allowance totaled   $1,338,000   at   September 30, 2016  , or   13.0%   of the total reserve, up slightly from the second quarter 2016. This compares to   $1,873,000   or   18.9%   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Management feels the change in the unallocated is consistent with improvement in credit quality. 
  The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans stood at   1.00%   as of   September 30, 2016  . This compares to   1.00%   of total loans as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Commercial loans are comprised of   three   major classes, commercial real estate loans, commercial construction loans and other commercial loans. Commercial real estate is primarily comprised of loans to small businesses collateralized by owner-occupied real estate, while other commercial is primarily comprised of loans to small businesses collateralized by plant and equipment, commercial fishing vessels and gear, and limited inventory-based lending. Commercial real estate loans typically have a maximum loan-to-value of   80%   based upon current appraisal information at the time the loan is made. Municipal loans are comprised of loans to municipalities in Maine for capitalized expenditures, construction projects or tax-anticipation notes. All municipal loans are considered general obligations of the municipality and as such are collateralized by the taxing ability of the municipality for repayment of debt. 
  Construction, land and land development loans, both commercial and residential, comprise a small portion of the portfolio, and at   21.9%   of capital are below the regulatory limit of   100.0%   of capital at   September 30, 2016  . Construction loans and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are at   102.9%   of total capital, below the regulatory limit of   300.0%   of capital at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The process of establishing the allowance with respect to the commercial loan portfolio begins when a loan officer initially assigns each loan a risk rating, using established credit criteria. Approximately   50%   of the outstanding loans and commitments are subject to review and validation annually by an independent consulting firm, as well as periodically by the Company's internal credit review function. The methodology employs Management's judgment as to the level of losses on existing loans based on internal review of the loan portfolio, including an analysis of a borrower's current financial position, and the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers and or lines of business.  
  
   Page 22 

In determining the Company's ability to collect certain loans, Management also considers the fair value of underlying collateral. The risk rating system has eight levels, defined as follows: 
    
  1        Strong 
  Credits rated "1" are characterized by borrowers fully responsible for the credit with excellent capacity to pay principal and interest. Loans rated "1" may be secured with acceptable forms of liquid collateral. 
  2          Above Average 
  Credits rated "2" are characterized by borrowers that have better than average liquidity, capitalization, earnings and/or cash flow with a consistent record of solid financial performance. 
  3        Satisfactory 
  Credits rated "3" are characterized by borrowers with favorable liquidity, profitability and financial condition with adequate cash flow to pay debt service. 
  4        Average 
  Credits rated "4" are characterized by borrowers that present risk more than 1, 2 and 3 rated loans and merit an ordinary level of ongoing monitoring. Financial condition is on par or somewhat below industry averages while cash flow is generally adequate to meet debt service requirements. 
  5        Watch 
  Credits rated "5" are characterized by borrowers that warrant greater monitoring due to financial condition or unresolved and identified risk factors. 
  6        Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM) 
  Loans in this category are currently protected but are potentially weak and constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard. OAEM have potential weaknesses which may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company's credit position at some future date. 
  7          Substandard 
  Loans in this category are inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
  8          Doubtful 
  Loans classified "Doubtful" have the same weaknesses as those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. 
  The following table summarizes the risk ratings for the Company's commercial real estate, commercial construction, commercial other, and municipal loans as of   September 30, 2016  :

Commercial loans are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. This determination is based on circumstances specific to a borrower including repayment ability, analysis of collateral and other factors as applicable. 
  Residential loans are comprised of   two   classes: term loans, which include traditional amortizing home mortgages, and construction loans, which include loans for owner-occupied residential construction. Residential loans typically have a   75%   to   80%   loan to value based upon current appraisal information at the time the loan is made. Home equity loans and lines of credit are typically written to the same underwriting standards. Consumer loans are primarily amortizing loans to individuals collateralized by automobiles, pleasure craft and recreation vehicles, typically with a maximum loan to value of   80%   to   90%   of the purchase price of the collateral. Consumer loans also include a small amount of unsecured short-term time notes to individuals. 
  Residential loans, consumer loans and home equity lines of credit are segregated into homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics. Trends and current conditions are analyzed and historical loss experience is adjusted accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative adjustment factors for these segments are consistent with those for the commercial and municipal classes. Certain loans in the residential, home equity lines of credit and consumer classes identified as having the potential for further deterioration are analyzed individually to confirm impairment status, and to determine the need for a specific reserve; however there is no formal rating system used for these classes. Consumer loans greater than   120   days past due are generally charged off. Residential loans   90   days or more past due are placed on non-accrual status unless the loans are both well secured and in the process of collection. One- to  four-family residential real estate loans and home equity loans are written down or charged-off no later than   180   days past due, or for residential real estate secured loans having a borrower in bankruptcy, within   60   days of receipt of notification of filing from the bankruptcy court, whichever is sooner. This is subject to completion of a current assessment of the value of the collateral with any outstanding loan balance in excess of the fair value of the property, less costs to sell, written down or charged-off.   
  There were no changes to the Company's accounting policies or methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Note 5   Stock Options and Stock-Based Compensation 
  At the 2010 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan"). This reserves   400,000   shares of common stock for issuance in connection with stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity based awards to attract and retain the best available personnel, provide additional incentive to officers, employees and non-employee Directors and promote the success of our business. Such grants and awards will be structured in a manner that does not encourage the recipients to expose the Company to undue or inappropriate risk. Options issued under the 2010 Plan will qualify for treatment as incentive stock options for purposes of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Other compensation under the 2010 Plan will qualify as performance-based for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and will satisfy NASDAQ guidelines relating to equity compensation. 

Page 27 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   108,710   shares of restricted stock had been granted under the 2010 Plan, of which   67,064   shares remain restricted as of   September 30, 2016   as detailed in the following table: 

The compensation cost related to these restricted stock grants is   $1,140,000   and will be recognized over the vesting terms of each grant. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $215,000   of expense was recognized for these restricted shares, leaving   $540,000   in unrecognized expense as of   September 30, 2016  . In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $222,000   of expense was recognized for restricted shares, leaving   $419,000   in unrecognized expense as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  The Company established a shareholder-approved stock option plan in 1995 (the "1995 Plan"), under which the Company granted options to employees for   600,000   shares of common stock. Only incentive stock options were granted under the 1995 Plan. The option price of each option grant was determined by the Options Committee of the Board of Directors, and in no instance was less than the fair market value on the date of the grant. An option's maximum term was   ten years   from the date of grant, with   50%   of the options granted vesting   two years   from the date of grant and the remaining   50%   vesting   five years   from the date of grant. As of January 16, 2005, all options under the 1995 Plan had been granted, and as of January 16, 2015, all options granted under the 1995 plan had been exercised or expired. 

Note 6   Preferred and Common Stock 
  Preferred Stock 
  On January 9, 2009, the Company issued   $25,000,000   in Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, to the U.S. Treasury ("Treasury') under the Capital Purchase Program ("the CPP Shares"). The CPP Shares qualified as Tier 1 capital on the Company's books for regulatory purposes and ranked senior to the Company's common stock and senior or at an equal level in the Company's capital structure to any other shares of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future. In three separate transactions in 2012 and 2013, the Company repurchased all of the CPP shares from the Treasury. 
  Incident to such issuance of the CPP shares, the Company issued to the Treasury warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase up to   225,904   shares of the Company's common stock at a price per share of   $16.60   (subject to adjustment). The Warrants (and any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Warrants) are freely transferable by the Treasury to third parties. The Warrants have a term of ten years and could be exercised by the Treasury or a subsequent holder at any time or from time to time during their term. To the extent they had not previously been exercised, the Warrants will expire after ten years. The Warrants were unchanged as a result of the CPP Shares repurchase transactions. 
  In May 2015, the Treasury sold all of the Warrants to private parties.  In accordance with the contractual terms of the Warrants, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and strike price were adjusted at the time of the sale. As a result of this transaction, the number of issuable shares under the Warrants now stands at   226,819   shares with a strike price of   $16.53   per share. 
    
  Common Stock 
  Proceeds from sale of common stock totaled   $391,000   and   $343,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Note 7   Earnings Per Share 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

All earnings per share calculations have been made using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The potentially dilutive securities are unvested shares of restricted stock granted to certain key members of Management and the warrants.  The number of dilutive shares is calculated using the treasury method, assuming that all warrants were exercisable at the end of each period. Warrants that are out-of-the-money are not considered in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. 
  The following table presents the number of warrants outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the amount for which the average market price at period end is above or below the strike price: 

Page 29 

Note 8   Employee Benefit Plans 
  401(k) Plan 
  The Bank has a defined contribution plan available to substantially all employees who have completed   3 months   of service. Employees may contribute up to Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") determined limits and the Bank may match employee contributions not to exceed   3.0%   of compensation depending on contribution level. Subject to a vote of the Board of Directors, the Bank may also make a profit-sharing contribution to the Plan. Such contribution equaled   2.0%   of each eligible employee's compensation in   2015  . The amount for   2016   has not been established. The expense related to the 401(k) plan was   $338,000   and   $333,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Retirement Benefits 
  The Bank also provides unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation payable over   two years  , as well as unfunded supplemental retirement benefits for certain officers, payable in installments over   20   years upon retirement or death. The agreements consist of individual contracts with differing characteristics that, when taken together, do not constitute a postretirement plan. The costs for these benefits are recognized over the service periods of the participating officers in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 712 "Compensation   Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits". The expense of these supplemental retirement benefits was   $161,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $234,000   for the same period in   2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the associated accrued liability included in other liabilities in the balance sheet was   $3,072,000   compared to   $3,088,000   and   $3,074,000   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 
  The Bank sponsors   two   post-retirement benefit plans. One plan currently provides a subsidy for health insurance premiums to certain retired employees and a future subsidy for   seven   active employees who were age   50   and over in 1996. These subsidies are based on years of service and range between   $40   and   $1,200   per month per person. The other plan provides life insurance coverage to certain retired employees and health insurance for retired directors. None of these plans are pre-funded. The Company utilizes FASB ASC Topic 712 to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The following table sets forth the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and funded status: 

The following table sets forth the net periodic pension cost: 

Page 30 

Amounts not yet reflected in net periodic benefit cost and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: 

A weighted average discount rate of   4.25%   was used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost. The assumed health care cost trend rate is   7.0%  . The measurement date for benefit obligations was as of year-end for prior years presented. The expected benefit payments for all of   2016   are   $121,000  . Plan expense for   2016   is estimated to be   $85,000  . A 1% change in trend assumptions would create an approximate change in the same direction of   $100,000   in the accumulated benefit obligation,   $7,000   in the interest cost and   $1,000   in the service cost.

Note 10 - Financial Derivative Instruments 
    
  As part of its overall asset and liability management strategy, the Company periodically uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. The Company s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the re-pricing characteristics of certain assets or liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant effect on net interest income.  
  The Company recognizes its derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.  On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, the Company designates whether the derivative is part of a hedging relationship (i.e., cash flow or fair value hedge). The Company formally documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company also assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss. Any ineffective portion is recorded in earnings. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes of the hedged risk on the hedged item, or management determines that the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 
  In 2016, interest rate swaps were contracted to limit the Company s exposure to rising interest rates on short-term liabilities indexed to one-month London Inter-bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). The interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges.  
  The details of the interest rate swap agreements are as follows:   

   (1)    Presented within other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  The Company would reclassify unrealized gains or losses accounted for within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings if the interest rate swaps were to become ineffective or the swaps were to terminate. In the next 12 months, the Company does not believe it will be required to reclassify any unrealized gains or losses accounted for within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings as a result of  ineffectiveness or swap termination. Amounts paid or received under the swaps are reported in interest expense in the statement of income, and in interest paid in the statement of cash flows. 

Note 11   Mortgage Servicing Rights 
    
  FASB ASC Topic 860 "Transfers and Servicing" requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. The Company's servicing assets and servicing liabilities are reported using the amortization method and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value by strata. In evaluating the carrying values of mortgage servicing rights, the Company obtains third party valuations based on loan level data including note rate, type and term of the underlying loans. The model utilizes several assumptions, the most significant of which is loan prepayments, calculated using a   three  -months moving average of weekly prepayment data published by the Public Securities Association (PSA) and modeled against the serviced loan portfolio, and the discount rate to discount future cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , the prepayment assumption using the PSA model was   271  , which translates into an anticipated prepayment rate of   16.24%  . The discount rate is the quarterly average   10   year U.S. Treasury plus     3.79%  . Other assumptions include delinquency rates, foreclosure rates, servicing cost inflation, and annual unit loan cost. All assumptions are adjusted periodically to reflect current circumstances. Amortization of mortgage servicing rights, as well as write-offs due to prepayments of the related mortgage loans, are recorded as a charge against mortgage servicing fee income. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , servicing rights capitalized totaled   $370,000   and   $358,000  , respectively. Servicing rights capitalized for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were   $197,000   and   $131,000   respectively.  Servicing rights amortized for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were   $339,000   and   $337,000  , respectively.  The fair value of servicing rights was   $1,683,000  ,   $1,915,000   and   $2,014,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,

December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Bank serviced loans for others totaling   $241,028,000  ,   $223,610,000   and   $218,624,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  Mortgage servicing rights are included in other assets and detailed in the following table: 

Note 12   Income Taxes 
  FASB ASC Topic 740 "Income Taxes" defines the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company's financial statements. Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS for the years ended December 31, 2013 through 2015. 

Note 13 - Certificates of Deposit 
  The following table represents the breakdown of certificates of deposit at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and at   December 31, 2015  : 

Note 14   Reclassifications 
  Certain items from the prior year were reclassified in the financial statements to conform with the current year presentation. These do not have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet or statement of income and comprehensive income presentations. 

Note 15   Fair Value 
  Certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value to provide additional insight into the Company's quality of earnings. Some of these assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis while others are measured on a nonrecurring basis, with the determination based upon applicable existing accounting pronouncements. For example, securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other assets, such as, other real estate owned and impaired loans, are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using the lower of cost or market methodology to determine impairment of individual assets. The Company groups assets and liabilities which are recorded at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement (with level 1 considered highest and level 3 considered lowest). A brief description of each level follows.  
  Level 1   - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  
  Level 2   - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.  
  Level 3   - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation includes use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.  

Page 34 

The fair value methods and assumptions for the Company's financial instruments and other assets measured at fair value are set forth below. 
    
  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Interest-Bearing Deposits in Other Banks  
  The carrying values of cash equivalents, due from banks and federal funds sold approximate their relative fair values. As such, the Company classifies these financial instruments as Level 1. 
    
  Investment Securities  
  The fair values of investment securities are estimated by independent providers using a market approach with observable inputs, including matrix pricing and recent transactions. In obtaining such valuation information from third parties, the Company has evaluated their valuation methodologies used to develop the fair values in order to determine whether the valuations are representative of an exit price in the Company's principal markets. The Company's principal markets for its securities portfolios are the secondary institutional markets, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in those markets. Fair values are calculated based on the value of one unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument, possible tax ramifications, or estimated transaction costs. If these considerations had been incorporated into the fair value estimates, the aggregate fair value could have been changed. The carrying values of restricted equity securities approximate fair values. As such, the Company classifies investment securities as Level 2. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of aggregate carrying value or fair value. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Company classifies mortgage loans held for sale as Level 2. 
    
  Loans  
  Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. The fair values of performing loans are calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest risk inherent in the loan. The estimates of maturity are based on the Company's historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions, and the effects of estimated prepayments. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows, and discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information. Management has made estimates of fair value using discount rates that it believes to be reasonable. However, because there is no market for many of these financial instruments, Management has no basis to determine whether the fair value presented above would be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale. As such, the Company classifies loans as Level 3, except for certain collateral-dependent impaired loans. Fair values of impaired loans are based on estimated cash flows and are discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the estimated cash flows, or if collateral dependent, discounted to the appraised value of the collateral as determined by reference to sale prices of similar properties, less costs to sell. As such, the Company classifies collateral dependent impaired loans for which a specific reserve results in a fair value measure as Level 2. All other impaired loans are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Other Real Estate Owned 
  Real estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value. The fair value of other real estate owned is based on property appraisals and an analysis of similar properties currently available. As such, the Company records other real estate owned as nonrecurring Level 2. 
    
  Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  Mortgage servicing rights represent the value associated with servicing residential mortgage loans. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities are reported using the amortization method and compared to fair value for impairment. In evaluating the fair values of mortgage servicing rights, the Company obtains third party valuations based on loan level data including note rate, type and term of the underlying loans. As such, the Company classifies mortgage servicing rights as Level 2.  
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable  
  The fair value estimate of this financial instrument approximates the carrying value as this financial instrument has a short maturity. It is the Company's policy to stop accruing interest on loans for which it is probable that the interest is not collectible. Therefore, this financial instrument has been adjusted for estimated credit loss. As such, the Company classifies accrued interest receivable as Level 2. 

Page 35 

Deposits  
  The fair value of deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. As such, the Company classifies deposits as Level 2. 
  The fair value estimates do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposits compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market. If that value were considered, the fair value of the Company's net assets could increase.  
    
  Borrowed Funds  
  The fair value of borrowed funds is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently available for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. As such, the Company classifies borrowed funds as Level 2. 
    
  Derivatives 
  The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using inputs that are observable in the market place obtained from third parties including yield curves, publicly available volatilities, and floating indexes and, accordingly, are classified as Level 2 inputs. The credit value adjustments associated with derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives due to collateral postings. 
    
  Accrued Interest Payable  
  The fair value estimate approximates the carrying amount as this financial instrument has a short maturity. The Company classifies accrued interest payable as Level 2. 
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments  
  Off-balance-sheet instruments include loan commitments. Fair values for loan commitments have not been presented as the future revenue derived from such financial instruments is not significant. 
    
  Limitations  
  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These values do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on Management's judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance-sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include the deferred tax asset, premises and equipment, and other real estate owned. In addition, tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.  
    
  Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following tables present the balances of assets and that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 

Page 36 

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  The following tables include assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that have had a fair value adjustment since their initial recognition.  Other real estate owned is presented net of an allowance of   $162,000  ,   $162,000   and   $409,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Only collateral-dependent impaired loans with a related specific allowance for loan losses or a partial charge off are included in impaired loans for purposes of fair value disclosures. Impaired loans below are presented net of specific allowances of     $496,000  ,   $292,000   and   $394,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  FASB ASC Topic 825 "Financial Instruments" requires disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, if the fair values can be reasonably determined. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company's various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques using observable inputs when available. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company.  
           The carrying amount and estimated fair values for financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

Note 16   Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The ASU was issued to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU changes how entities account for equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The ASU also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of U.S. GAAP, including a requirement for public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is reviewing the guidance in the ASU to determine whether it will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  
   Page 40 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under the new guidance, which will replace the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, banks and other lending institutions will be required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses. The new guidance, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. A modified version of these requirements also applies to debt securities classified as available for sale.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within such years. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  This report contains statements that are "forward-looking statements." We may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in our annual reports to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by our officers, directors or employees. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "outlook," "will," "should," and other expressions that predict or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. You should not rely on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
  Some of the factors that might cause these differences include the following: changes in general national, regional or international economic conditions or conditions affecting the banking or financial services industries or financial capital markets, volatility and disruption in national and international financial markets, government intervention in the U.S. financial system, reductions in net interest income resulting from interest rate volatility as well as changes in the balance and mix of loans and deposits, reductions in the market value of wealth management assets under administration, changes in the value of securities and other assets, reductions in loan demand, changes in loan collectability, default and charge-off rates, changes in the size and nature of the Company's competition, changes in legislation or regulation and accounting principles, policies and guidelines, and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. In addition, the factors described under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC, may result in these differences. You should carefully review all of these factors, and you should be aware that there may be other factors that could cause these differences. These forward-looking statements were based on information, plans and estimates at the date of this quarterly report, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events or other changes. 
  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to republish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the Company, which attempt to advise interested parties of the facts that affect the Company's business. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition is based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of such financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Management evaluates its estimates, including those related to the allowance for loan losses, goodwill, the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, and other-than-temporary impairment on securities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from the amount derived from Management's estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions. 
  Allowance for Loan Losses.   Management believes the allowance for loan losses requires the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses is based on Management's evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it to determine the appropriate level by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience, the character and size of the loan portfolio, business and economic conditions and Management's estimation of potential losses. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses. 
  Goodwill.   Management utilizes numerous techniques to estimate the value of various assets held by the Company, including methods to determine the appropriate carrying value of goodwill as required under FASB ASC Topic 350 "Intangibles   Goodwill and Other." In addition, goodwill from a purchase acquisition is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests, which include an evaluation of the ongoing assets, liabilities and revenues from the acquisition and an estimation of the impact of business conditions. 
  
   Page 42 

Mortgage Servicing Rights.   The valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy which requires significant estimates and assumptions. The Bank often sells mortgage loans it originates and retains the ongoing servicing of such loans, receiving a fee for these services, generally 0.25% of the outstanding balance of the loan per annum. Mortgage servicing rights are recognized at fair value when they are acquired through the sale of loans, and are reported in other assets. They are amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. The rights are subsequently carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Management uses an independent firm which specializes in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights to determine the fair value which is recorded on the balance sheet. The most important assumption is the anticipated loan prepayment rate, and increases in prepayment speed results in lower valuations of mortgage servicing rights. The valuation also includes an evaluation for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights, which can vary depending upon current interest rates and prepayment expectations, as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics, such as interest rates and terms. The use of different assumptions could produce a different valuation. All of the assumptions are based on standards the Company believes would be utilized by market participants in valuing mortgage servicing rights and are consistently derived and/or benchmarked against independent public sources. 
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment on Securities.   One of the significant estimates related to investment securities is the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments. The evaluation of securities for other-than-temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition and/or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period of unrealized losses. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if other-than-temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors and measures. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value of securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost and the expected recovery period of the security, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) the volatility of the securities' market price, (e) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery, which may be at maturity and (f) any other information and observable data considered relevant in determining whether other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, including the expectation of receipt of all principal and interest when due. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedges.   The Company recognizes all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. On the date the Company enters into the derivative contract, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of either a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge ), a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair value hedge ), or a held for trading instrument ( trading instrument ). The Company formally documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. Changes in fair value of a derivative that is effective and that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction or related cash flows affect earnings. Changes in fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge and the change in fair value of the hedged item are both recorded in earnings and offset each other when the transaction is effective. Those derivatives that are classified as trading instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, that it is unlikely that the forecasted transaction will occur, or that the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Certain information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Report contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in its analysis of the Company's performance and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The Company believes that a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance. Management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

In several places net interest income is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Specifically included in interest income was tax-exempt interest income from certain investment securities and loans. An amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax exempt income has been added back to the interest income total which, as adjusted, increased net interest income accordingly. Management believes the disclosure of tax-equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis, and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the Company's results of operations. Other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. This adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution's net interest income to that of another, as each will have a different proportion of tax-exempt interest from its earning assets. Moreover, net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets. For purposes of this measure as well, other financial institutions generally use tax-equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution. The Company follows these practices. The following table provides a reconciliation of tax-equivalent financial information to the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A 35.0% tax rate was used in both   2016   and   2015  . 

The Company presents its efficiency ratio using non-GAAP information which is most commonly used by financial institutions. The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is noninterest expenses divided by net interest income plus noninterest income from the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The non-GAAP efficiency ratio excludes securities losses and other-than-temporary impairment charges from noninterest expenses, excludes securities gains from noninterest income, and adds the tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income. The following table provides a reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP efficiency ratio: 

The Company presents certain information based upon average tangible shareholders' common equity instead of total average shareholders' equity. The difference between these measures is the Company's intangible assets, specifically goodwill from prior acquisitions. Management, banking regulators and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and the tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions. The following table provides a reconciliation of average tangible shareholders' common equity to the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP:

Executive Summary 
  Net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $13.7 million  ,   up     $1.3 million   or   10.1%   from the same period in   2015  . Earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis were   $1.27   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   up     $0.11   or   9.5%   from the   $1.16   posted for the same period in   2015  .  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , net income was   $4.6 million  ,   up     $374,000   or   8.9%   from the same period in   2015  . Earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis were   $0.42   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  ,   up     $0.03   or   7.7%   from the   $0.39   posted in   2015  . Compared to the previous quarter, net income was   down     $62,000   or   1.3%   and earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis were   down     $0.01   or   2.3%  . 
  This was the best performance for the first nine months of the year in the Company's history. It was also the second best quarter in the Company's history, just $62,000 below the record set in the second quarter of this year. Increased net interest income continues to drive our 2016 performance, the result of strong growth in earning assets.  We maintained the quarterly dividend at 23 cents per share in the third quarter and we continue to pay out more than half of our net income to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends. 
   Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was   up     $1.9 million   or   5.8%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , with all of the increase attributable to growth in earning assets, specifically in the loan portfolio, and a small takeaway attributable to our net interest margin slipping to 3.08% in 2016 versus 3.09% in 2015 due to securities calls. 
  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis   increased     $28,000   or   0.2%   compared to the same period in   2015  . Compared to the previous quarter, net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was   down     $396,000   or   3.4%  . 
        Non-interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $28,000   or   0.3%     lower   than in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to a lower level of gains from sale of securities. This was greatly offset, however, by a $441,000 or 40.3% increase in mortgage origination and servicing income. Non-interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $102,000   or   0.5%     lower   than in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a reduction in other-credit-related costs outside of the provision for loan losses. 
  This reduction in other-credit-related costs was driven by continued improvement in credit quality.  Non-performing assets stood at   0.49%   of total assets as of   September 30, 2016   - well below the   0.65%   of total assets as of   September 30, 2015   and down from   0.57%   as of   December 31, 2015  . Total past-due loans were   0.95%   of total loans as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.84%   of total loans as of   December 31, 2015  , and down from   1.01%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  The provision for loan losses for the first   nine months   of   2016   was   $1.1 million  ,   $25,000   or   2.3%     higher   than in the same period in   2015  . Net loan chargeoffs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $743,000   or   0.10%   of average loans on an annualized basis. This was down   $1.0 million   from net chargeoffs of   $1.8 million   or   0.25%   of average loans on an annualized basis for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The allowance for loan losses   increased     $382,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , and is   1.00%   of loans outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , even with   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  .  
  Total assets have   increased     $70.3 million   or   4.5%   year-to-date. The loan portfolio   increased     $40.4 million   or   4.1%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $65.8 million   or   6.8%   from a year ago. After topping the $1.0 billion mark in the first quarter of this year, the loan portfolio dropped slightly in the third quarter.  This was partly due to lines of credit paying down earlier than expected. The majority of the loan growth has been in commercial and municipal loans, with modest growth in other loan categories. The investment portfolio has   increased     $7.8 million   year-to-date and   increased     $9.9 million   or   2.1%   from a year ago. On the liability side of the balance sheet, low-cost deposits have   increased     $93.4 million   or   16.1%   year-to-date and increased   $98.8 million   or   17.2%   over the past year. Local certificates of deposit ("CDs") increased   $10.0 million   and wholesale CDs increased   $43.5 million   over the past year. 
  Remaining well capitalized remains a top priority for The First Bancorp, Inc. Since December 31, 2008, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio has increased from 11.13% to   16.49%  , well above the well-capitalized threshold of 10.0% set by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The Company's operating ratios remain good, with a return on average tangible common equity of   12.67%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   12.29%   for the same period in   2015  . Based upon June 30, 2016 data, our return on average tangible common equity was in the top 15% of all banks in the UBPR peer group, which had an average return on equity of 9.46%. Our efficiency ratio continues to be an important component in our overall performance and   dropped   over 3.0% to   50.19%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   53.76%   for the same period in   2015  . This ratio remains well below the UBPR peer group average of 64.25% as of June 30, 2016. 
   
  Net Interest Income 
  Total interest income of   $40.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was an   increase   of   $2.4 million   or   6.3%   compared to total interest income of   $37.8 million   for the same period of   2015  . Total interest expense of   $8.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was an increase of $469,000 or 6.3% compared to total interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . As a result, net interest income of   $32.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   an increase   of   $1.9 million   or   6.3%   compared to net interest income of   $30.3 million   for the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company's net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis   decreased   from   3.09%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   3.08%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Tax-exempt interest income amounted to   $4.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $4.3 million   for the same period of   2015  . 
        Total interest income of   $13.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   is a   3.5%     increase   from total interest income of   $12.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015  . Total interest expense of   $2.8 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   is a   18.6%     increase   from total interest expense of   $2.3 million   for the comparable period of   2015  . As a result, net interest income   increased     0.2%   or   $18,000   to   $10.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from the same  period in   2015  . The Company's net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased from   3.11%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   2.98%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Tax-exempt interest income amounted to   $1.5 million   and   $1.4 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The following tables present the amount of interest earned or paid, as well as the average yield or rate on an annualized basis, for each major category of assets or liabilities for the   nine months   and quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35.0% tax rate in   2016   and   2015  .

Non-Interest Income 
  Non-interest income of   $9.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is   a decrease   of   $28,000   compared to the same period in   2015  . This was primarily due to a lower level of gains from sale of securities. This was greatly offset, however, by a $441,000 or 40.3% increase in mortgage origination and servicing income. Non-interest income was   $3.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   16.6%   from the   $3.0 million   reported for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was attributable to the increase in mortgage origination and servicing income. 
   
  Non-Interest Expense 
  Non-interest expense of   $21.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is   a decrease   of   0.5%   or   $102,000   compared to non-interest expense of   $22.0 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a reduction in other-credit-related costs outside of the provision for loan losses.  The Company's efficiency ratio has   dropped   more than 3.0% to   50.19%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   53.76%   for the same period in   2015  .  Noninterest expense of   $7.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   is   a decrease   of   3.9%   compared to noninterest expense of   $7.7 million   for the same period in   2015   due to the reasons mentioned above. 
   
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes on operating earnings were   $5.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   up     $715,000   from the same period in   2015  . This is in line with the increase in the Company's level of income before income taxes. 
   
  Investments 
  The Company's investment portfolio   increased   by   $7.8 million   between   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , mortgage-backed securities had a carrying value of   $295.7 million   and a fair value of   $297.1 million  . Of this total, securities with a fair value of   $199.8   million or   67.3%   of the mortgage-backed portfolio were issued by the Government National Mortgage Association and securities with a fair value of   $97.3   million or   32.7%   of the mortgage-backed portfolio were issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association.  
  The Company's investment securities are classified into two categories: securities available for sale and securities to be held to maturity. Securities available for sale consist primarily of debt securities which Management intends to hold for indefinite periods of time. They may be used as part of the Company's funds management strategy, and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk and liquidity needs, to increase capital ratios, or for other similar reasons. Securities to be held to maturity consist primarily of debt securities that the Company has acquired solely for long-term investment purposes, rather than potential future sale. For securities to be categorized as held to maturity Management must have the intent and the Company must have the ability to hold such investments until their respective maturity dates. The Company does not hold trading account securities. 
  All investment securities are managed in accordance with a written investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors. It is the Company's general policy that investments for either portfolio be limited to government debt obligations, time deposits, and corporate bonds or commercial paper with one of the three highest ratings given by a nationally recognized rating agency. The portfolio is currently invested primarily in U.S. Government agency securities and tax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions. The individual securities have been selected to enhance the portfolio's overall yield while not materially adding to the Company's level of interest rate risk. 
  During the third quarter of 2014, the Company transferred securities with a total amortized cost of $89,780,000 and a corresponding fair value of $89,757,000 from available for sale to held to maturity. The net unrealized loss, net of taxes, on these securities at the date of the transfer was $15,000. The net unrealized holding loss at the time of transfer continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and is amortized over the remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment of the yield. The amortization of the net unrealized loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will offset the effect on interest income of the discount for the transferred securities. The remaining unamortized balance of the net unrealized losses for the securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity was   $124,000   at   September 30, 2016  . These securities were transferred as a part of the Company's overall investment and balance sheet strategies.

The following table sets forth the Company's investment securities at their carrying amounts as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Page 51 

The following table sets forth yields and contractual maturities of the Company's investment securities as of   September 30, 2016  . Yields on tax-exempt securities have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35%. Mortgage-backed securities are presented according to their final contractual maturity date, while the calculated yield takes into effect the intermediate cash flows from repayment of principal which results in a much shorter average life. 

Impaired Securities 
  The securities portfolio contains certain securities that the amortized cost of which exceeds fair value, which at   September 30, 2016   amounted to   $735,000  , or   0.16%   of the amortized cost of the total securities portfolio. At   December 31, 2015   this amount was   $3.5 million  , or   0.76%   of the amortized cost of total securities portfolio. As a part of the Company's ongoing security monitoring process, the Company identifies securities in an unrealized loss position that could potentially be other-than-temporarily impaired. If a decline in the fair value of a debt security is judged to be other-than-temporary, the decline related to credit loss is recorded in net realized securities losses while the decline attributable to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive income or loss. 
  The Company's evaluation of securities for impairment is a quantitative and qualitative process intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investment securities should be recognized in current period earnings. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in the fair value of securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost and the expected recovery period of the security, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) the volatility of the securities market price, (e) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery, which may be at maturity, and (f) any other information and observable data considered relevant in determining whether other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. 
  
   Page 52 

The Company's best estimate of cash flows uses severe economic recession assumptions due to market uncertainty. The Company's assumptions include but are not limited to delinquencies, foreclosure levels and constant default rates on the underlying collateral, loss severity ratios, and constant prepayment rates. If the Company does not expect to receive 100% of future contractual principal and interest, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had temporarily impaired securities with a fair value of   $95.3 million   and unrealized losses of   $735,000  , as identified in the table below. This was down from   December 31, 2015   as a result of a shift in the yield curve and a corresponding increase in value of investment securities. Securities in a continuous unrealized loss position more than twelve months amounted to   $2.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $21.0   million at   December 31, 2015  . The Company has concluded that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired. This conclusion was based on the issuer's continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and the expectation that the issuer will continue to do so, Management's intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value which may be at maturity, the expectation that the Company will receive 100% of future contractual cash flows, as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuer's financial condition and other objective evidence. The following table summarizes temporarily impaired securities and their approximate fair values at   September 30, 2016  : 

For securities with unrealized losses, the following information was considered in determining that the securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired: 
  Securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and enterprises.   As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no unrealized losses on these securities compared to   $2.3 million   unrealized losses as of   December 31, 2015  . All of these securities were credit rated "AAA" or "AA+" by the major credit rating agencies. Management believes that  securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and enterprises have minimal credit risk, as these agencies and enterprises play a vital role in the nation's financial markets and does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises.   As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $547,000   of unrealized losses on these securities compared with   $1.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . All of these securities were credit rated "AAA" or "AA+" by the major credit rating agencies. Management believes that securities issued by U.S. Government agencies bear no credit risk because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and that securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk, as these agencies and enterprises play a vital role in the nation's financial markets. Management believes that the unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   were attributable to changes in current market yields and spreads since the date the underlying securities were purchased, and does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . The Company also has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery of their amortized cost, which may be at maturity. 
  Obligations of state and political subdivisions.   As of   September 30, 2016  , there were $170,000 of unrealized losses on these securities compared to   $87,000   at   December 31, 2015  . Municipal securities are supported by the general taxing authority of the municipality and, in the cases of school districts, are generally supported by state aid. At   September 30, 2016  , all municipal bond issuers were current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments. The Company attributes the unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   to changes in prevailing market yields and pricing spreads since the date the underlying securities were purchased, combined with current market liquidity conditions and the disruption in the financial markets in general. Accordingly, the Company does not consider these municipal securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . The Company also has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery of their amortized cost, which may be at maturity. 
  
   Page 53 

Corporate securities.   There were no unrealized losses on corporate securities as of   September 30, 2016  , or at   December 31, 2015  .   Corporate securities are dependent on the operating performance of the issuers. At   September 30, 2016  , all corporate bond issuers were current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments.  
  Other equity securities  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the total unrealized losses on other equity securities amounted to   $18,000   compared with   $6,000   at   December 31, 2015  . Other equity securities is comprised of common and preferred stock holdings. The unrealized losses were the result of normal market fluctuations for equity securities. Accordingly, the Company does not consider other equity securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 
  The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Boston, a cooperatively owned wholesale bank for housing and finance in the six New England States. As a requirement of membership in the FHLB, the Bank must own a minimum required amount of FHLB stock, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. The Bank uses the FHLB for much of its wholesale funding needs. As of   September 30, 2016  , 2015 and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank's investment in FHLB stock totaled   $13.0 million  ,   $12.9 million   and    $13.2 million  , respectively. FHLB stock is a non-marketable equity security and therefore is reported at cost, which equals par value. The Company periodically evaluates its investment in FHLB stock for impairment based on, among other factors, the capital adequacy of the FHLB and its overall financial condition. No impairment losses have been recorded through   September 30, 2016  . The Bank will continue to monitor its investment in FHLB stock. 
   
  Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $1.2 million   in loans held for sale.  This compares to   $349,000   in loans held for sale at   December 31, 2015   and   $200,000   in loans held for sale at   September 30, 2015  . The Bank participates in FHLB's Mortgage Partnership Finance Program ("MPF"), selling loans with recourse.  The volume of loans sold to date through the MPF program is de minimis; therefore, there was minimum impact on the reserve. 
  Loans 
  The loan portfolio   increased   during the first   nine months   of   2016  , with total loans at   $1.03 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,   up     $40.4 million   or   4.1%   from total loans of   $988.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Commercial loans   increased     $25.2 million   or   6.0%   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , municipal loans   increased     $6.4 million   or   32.4%  , residential term loans   increased     $129,000   and home equity lines of credit   increased     $1.8 million  . 
  Commercial loans are comprised of three major classes, commercial real estate loans, commercial construction loans and other commercial loans. Commercial real estate is primarily comprised of loans to small businesses collateralized by owner-occupied real estate, while other commercial is primarily comprised of loans to small businesses collateralized by plant and equipment, commercial fishing vessels and gear, and limited inventory-based lending.Commercial real estate loans typically have a maximum loan-to-value of 80% based upon current appraisal information at the time the loan is made. Land and land development loans typically have a maximum loan-to-value of 65% to 75% based upon current appraisal information at the time the loan is made. Construction, land and land improvement loans, both commercial and residential, comprise a small portion of the portfolio, and at   21.9%   of capital are well under the regulatory guidance of 100.0% of capital. Construction loans and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are at   102.9%   of total capital, well under the regulatory guidance of 300.0% of capital. Municipal loans are comprised of loans to municipalities in the State of Maine for capitalized expenditures, construction projects or tax-anticipation notes. All municipal loans are considered general obligations of the municipality and as such are collateralized by the taxing ability of the municipality for repayment of debt. 
  Residential loans are also comprised of two classes, term loans, which include traditional amortizing home mortgages, and construction loans, which include loans for owner-occupied residential construction. Residential loans typically have a 75% to 80% loan to value based upon current appraisal information at the time the loan is made. Consumer loans are primarily amortizing loans to individuals collateralized by automobiles, pleasure craft and recreation vehicles, typically with a maximum loan to value of 80% to 90% of the purchase price of the collateral. Consumer loans also include a small amount of unsecured short-term time notes to individuals.

Credit Risk Management and Allowance for Loan Losses 
  Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower to meet its obligations. We manage credit risk by evaluating the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, the nature of the underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions, and expectations. We attempt to manage the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio through various control processes, such as credit evaluation of borrowers, establishment of lending limits, and application of lending procedures, including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances. However, we seek to rely primarily on the cash flow of our borrowers as the principal source of repayment. Although credit policies and evaluation processes are designed to minimize our risk, Management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio, as well as general and regional economic conditions. 
  We provide for loan losses through the establishment of an allowance for loan losses which represents an estimated reserve for existing losses in the loan portfolio. We deploy a systematic methodology for determining our allowance that includes a quarterly review process, risk rating, and adjustment to our allowance. We classify our portfolios as either commercial or residential and consumer and monitor credit risk separately as discussed below. We evaluate the appropriateness of our allowance continually based on a review of all significant loans, with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing, past due, and other loans that we believe require special attention. 
  The allowance consists of four elements: (1) specific reserves for loans evaluated individually for impairment; (2) general reserves for types or portfolios of loans based on historical loan loss experience; (3) qualitative reserves judgmentally adjusted for local and national economic conditions, concentrations, portfolio composition, volume and severity of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, trends of criticized and classified loans, changes in credit policies, and underwriting standards, credit administration practices, and other factors as applicable; and (4) unallocated reserves. All outstanding loans are considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance. 
  Appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is determined using a consistent, systematic methodology, which analyzes the risk inherent in the loan portfolio. In addition to evaluating the collectability of specific loans when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, Management also takes into consideration other factors such as changes in the mix and size of the loan portfolio, historic loss experience, the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified, economic trends, changes in credit policies, and experience, ability and depth of lending management. The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific reserve allocations are made against certain adversely classified loans, and general reserve allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio which have similar attributes. The Company's historical loss experience, industry trends, and the impact of the local and regional economy on the Company's borrowers, are considered by Management in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. 
  The allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against current earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when Management believes that the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance. While Management uses available information to assess possible losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in non-performing loans, changes in economic conditions, growth in loan portfolios, or for other reasons. Any future additions to the allowance would be recognized in the period in which they were determined to be necessary. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process. Such agencies may require the Company to record additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of Management. 
    
  Commercial 
  Our commercial portfolio includes all secured and unsecured loans to borrowers for commercial purposes, including commercial lines of credit and commercial real estate. Our process for evaluating commercial loans includes performing updates on loans that we have rated for risk. Our non-performing commercial loans are generally reviewed individually to determine impairment, accrual status, and the need for specific reserves. Our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative factors include our historical loss experience by loan type, collateral values, financial condition of borrowers, and other factors. Qualitative factors include judgments concerning general economic conditions that may affect credit quality, credit concentrations, the pace of portfolio growth, and delinquency levels; these qualitative factors are also considered in connection with our unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses. 
  The process of establishing the allowance with respect to our commercial loan portfolio begins when a loan officer initially assigns each loan a risk rating, using established credit criteria. Approximately 50% of our outstanding loans and commitments are subject to review and validation annually by an independent consulting firm, as well as periodically by our internal credit review function. Our methodology employs Management's judgment as to the level of losses on existing loans based on our internal review of the loan portfolio, including an analysis of the borrowers' current financial position, and the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers and or lines of business. In determining our ability to collect certain loans, we also consider the fair value of any underlying collateral. We also evaluate credit risk concentrations, including trends in large dollar exposures to related borrowers, industry and geographic concentrations, and economic and environmental factors. 

Page 56 

Residential, Home Equity and Consumer 
  Consumer, home equity and residential mortgage loans are generally segregated into homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics. Trends and current conditions in these pools are analyzed and historical loss experience is adjusted accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative adjustment factors for the consumer, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios are consistent with those for the commercial portfolios. Certain loans in the consumer and residential portfolios identified as having the potential for further deterioration are analyzed individually to confirm the appropriate risk status and accrual status, and to determine the need for a specific reserve. Consumer loans that are greater than 120 days past due are generally charged off. Residential loans and home equity lines of credit that are greater than 90 days past due are evaluated for collateral adequacy and if deficient are placed on non-accrual status. 
    
  Unallocated 
  The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for losses that are not identified when establishing the specific and general portions of the allowance and is based upon Management's evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the portfolio and loan specific allowances. Such conditions may include general economic and business conditions affecting our lending area, credit quality trends (including trends in delinquencies and nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions), loan volumes and concentrations, duration of the current business cycle, bank regulatory examination results, findings of external loan review examiners, and Management's judgment with respect to various other conditions including loan administration and management and the quality of risk identification systems. Management reviews these conditions quarterly. We have risk management practices designed to ensure timely identification of changes in loan risk profiles; however, undetected losses may exist inherently within the loan portfolio. The judgmental aspects involved in applying the risk grading criteria, analyzing the quality of individual loans, and assessing collateral values can also contribute to undetected, but probable, losses. Changes in various elements of the allowance caused the period-to-period decrease. Management feels the change in the unallocated is consistent with improvement in credit quality. 
  The allowance for loan losses includes reserve amounts assigned to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment. Certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when Management believes it is probable that the Company will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. Under this method, loans are selected for evaluation based on internal risk ratings or non-accrual status. A specific reserve is allocated to an individual loan when that loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimable on the basis of its collateral value, the present value of anticipated future cash flows, or its net realizable value. At   September 30, 2016  , impaired loans with specific reserves totaled   $8.8 million   and the amount of such reserves was   $949,000  . This compares to impaired loans with specific reserves of   $8.6 million   at   December 31, 2015   and the amount of such reserves was   $754,000  . 
  All of these analyses are reviewed and discussed by the Directors' Loan Committee, and recommendations from these processes provide Management and the Board of Directors with independent information on loan portfolio condition. Our total allowance at   September 30, 2016   is considered by Management to be appropriate to address the credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. Management views the level of the allowance for loan losses as appropriate. However, our determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions we make about future events, which we believe are reasonable, but which may or may not prove valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that our charge-offs in future periods will not exceed our allowance for loan losses or that we will not need to make additional increases in our allowance for loan losses. 
  The following table summarizes our allocation of allowance by loan class as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   December 31, 2015  . The percentages are the portion of each loan class to total loans.

The allowance for loan losses totaled   $10.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   $9.7 million   as of   September 30, 2015  . Management's ongoing application of methodologies to establish the allowance include an evaluation of impaired loans for specific reserves. These specific reserves increased   $195,000   in the first   nine months   of   2016   from   $754,000   at   December 31, 2015   to   $949,000   at   September 30, 2016  . The specific loans that make up those categories change from period to period. Impairment on those loans, which would be reflected in the allowance for loan losses, might or might not exist, depending on the specific circumstances of each loan. The portion of the reserve based upon homogeneous pools of loans increased by   $469,000   in the first   nine months   of   2016  . This increase was due to a $1.0 million overlay in pooled reserves due to increased commercial loan volume this year and potential weakness in a small number of credits which are currently performing. The portion of the reserve based on qualitative factors increased by   $253,000   in the first   nine months   of   2016   as a result of adjustments for several qualitative factors. After consideration of the shifts in specific, pooled and qualitative reserves, Management determined that market trends and other internal factors warranted the   $535,000   decrease in unallocated reserves in the first   nine months   of   2016   from   $1.9 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $1.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  A breakdown of the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016  , by loan class and allowance element, is presented in the following table: 

Based upon Management's evaluation, provisions are made to maintain the allowance as a best estimate of inherent losses within the portfolio. The provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance was   $1,125,000   for the first   nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $25,000   from the first   nine months   of   2015  . Net chargeoffs were   $743,000   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to net chargeoffs of   $1.8 million   in the first   nine months   of   2015  . Our allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans was   1.00%   as of   September 30, 2016  , even with   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  . 
  
   Page 58 

The following table summarizes the activities in our allowance for loan losses for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  : 

1    Annualized using a 366-day basis for 2016 and a 365-day basis for 2015. 
  Management believes the allowance for loan losses is appropriate as of   September 30, 2016  . In Management's opinion, the level of the provision for loan losses is directionally consistent with the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio and corresponding levels of nonperforming loans,  as well as with the performance of the national and local economies. 
   
  Nonperforming Loans 
  Nonperforming loans are comprised of loans, for which based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when principal and interest is 90 days or more past due unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection (in which case the loan may continue to accrue interest in spite of its past due status). A loan is "well secured" if it is secured (1) by collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt including accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a financially responsible party. A loan is "in the process of collection" if collection of the loan is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement p 
  
   Page 59 

rocedures, or, (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future. 
  When a loan becomes nonperforming (generally 90 days past due), it is evaluated for collateral dependency based upon the most recent appraisal or other evaluation method. If the collateral value is lower than the outstanding loan balance plus accrued interest and estimated selling costs, the loan is placed on non-accrual status, all accrued interest is reversed from interest income, and a specific reserve is established for the difference between the loan balance and the collateral value less selling costs, or, in certain situations, the difference between the loan balance and the collateral value less selling costs is written off. Concurrently, a new appraisal or valuation may be ordered, depending on collateral type, currency of the most recent valuation, the size of the loan, and other factors appropriate to the loan. Upon receipt and acceptance of the new valuation, the loan may have an additional specific reserve or write down based on the updated collateral value. On an ongoing basis, appraisals or valuations may be done periodically on collateral dependent non-performing loans and an additional specific reserve or write down will be made, if appropriate, based on the new collateral value. 
  Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual, it remains in nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current. All payments made on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance of the loan. 
  Nonperforming loans, expressed as a percentage of total loans, totaled   0.69%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.75%   at   December 31, 2015   and   0.83%   at   September 30, 2015  . The following table shows the distribution of nonperforming loans by class as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Total nonperforming loans does not include loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest. These are loans for which we expect to collect all amounts due, including past-due interest. As of   September 30, 2016  , loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest totaled   $7,000  , compared to   $136,000   at   December 31, 2015   and   $109,000   at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructured 
  A troubled debt restructured ("TDR") constitutes a restructuring of debt if the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. To determine whether or not a loan should be classified as a TDR, Management evaluates a loan based upon the following criteria: 
             
    The borrower demonstrates financial difficulty; common indicators include past due status with bank obligations, substandard credit bureau reports, or an inability to refinance with another lender, and 
                
    The Bank has granted a concession; common concession types include maturity date extension, interest rate adjustments to below market pricing, and deferment of payments. 
     Our overall level of TDRs   decreased   during the first   nine months   of   2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   75   loans with a value of   $22.0 million   that have been restructured. This compares to   84   loans with a value of   $23.9 million   and   88   loans with a value of   $24.7 million   classified as TDRs as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
  
   Page 60 

The following table shows the activity in loans classified as TDRs between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   64   loans with an aggregate balance of   $20.6 million   were performing under the modified terms,   two   loans with an aggregate balance of   $495,000   were more than 30 days past due and accruing and   nine   loans with an aggregate balance of   $971,000   were on nonaccrual. As a percentage of aggregate outstanding balance,   93.3%   were performing under the modified terms,   2.2%   were more than 30 days past due and accruing and   4.4%   were on nonaccrual. The performance status of all TDRs as of   September 30, 2016  , as well as the associated specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses, is summarized by type of loan in the following table. 

Residential TDRs (including home equity lines of credit) as of   September 30, 2016   included 56 loans with an aggregate balance of $11.2 million, and the modifications granted fell into five major categories. Loans totaling $6.9 million had an extension of term, allowing the borrower to repay over an extended number of years and lowering the monthly payment to a level the borrower can afford. Loans totaling $4.0 million had interest capitalized, allowing the borrower to become current after unpaid interest was added to the balance of the loan and re-amortized over the remaining life of the loan. Loans with an aggregate balance of $249,000 were converted from interest-only to regular principal-and-interest payments based on the borrowers' ability to service the higher payment amount. Short-term rate concessions were granted on loans totaling $2.0 million, with a rate concession typically of 1.0% or less. Loans with an aggregate balance of $2.4 million were involved in bankruptcy. Certain residential TDRs had more than one modification. 
  Commercial TDRs as of   September 30, 2016     were comprised of 19 loans with a balance of $10.8 million. Of this total, 13 loans with an aggregate balance of $7.5 million had an extended period of interest-only payments, deferring the start of principal repayment. Three loans with an aggregate balance of $1.8 million had an extension of term, allowing the borrower to repay over an extended number of years and lowering the monthly payment to a level the borrower can afford. The remaining three loans with an aggregate balance of $1.5 million had several different modifications. 
  In each case when a loan was modified, Management determined it was in the Bank's best interest to work with the borrower with modified terms rather than to proceed to foreclosure. Once a loan is classified as a TDR it remains classified as such until the balance is fully repaid, despite whether the loan is performing under the modified terms. As of   September 30, 2016  , Management is aware of   six   loans classified as TDRs that are involved in bankruptcy with an outstanding balance of   $1.1 million  . There were also   nine   loans with an outstanding balance of   $971,000   that were classified as TDRs and on non-accrual status.   Three   loans with an outstanding balance of   $222,000   were in the process of foreclosure.

Impaired Loans 
  Impaired loans include restructured loans and loans placed on non-accrual status. These loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure of an impaired loan is lower than the recorded investment in the loan, a specific reserve is established for the difference. Impaired loans totaled   $28.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and have decreased   $1.3 million   from   December 31, 2015  . The number of loans decreased by   nine   from   145   to   136   during the same period. Impaired commercial loans decreased   $493,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . The specific allowance for impaired commercial loans increased from   $399,000   at   December 31, 2015   to   $548,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , which represented the fair value deficiencies for loans where the fair value of the collateral or net present value of expected cash flows was estimated at less than our carrying amount of the loan. From   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , impaired residential loans decreased   $957,000   and impaired home equity lines of credit decreased   $66,000  . 
  The following table sets forth impaired loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Past Due Loans 
  The Bank's overall loan delinquency ratio was   0.95%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.84%   at   December 31, 2015   and   1.01%   at   September 30, 2015  . Loans 90 days delinquent and accruing decreased from   $136,000   at   December 31, 2015   to   $7,000   as of   September 30, 2016  .

Potential Problem Loans and Loans in Process of Foreclosure 
  Potential problem loans consist of classified accruing commercial and commercial real estate loans that were between 30 and 89 days past due. Such loans are characterized by weaknesses in the financial condition of borrowers or collateral deficiencies. Based on historical experience, the credit quality of some of these loans may improve due to improvements in the economy as well as changes in collateral values or the financial condition of the borrowers, while the credit quality of other loans may deteriorate, resulting in some amount of loss. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   seven   potential problem loans with a balance of   $479,000   or   0.05%   of total loans. This compares to   six   loans with a balance of   $579,000   or   0.06%   of total loans at   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   19   loans in the process of foreclosure with a total balance of   $2.9   million. The Bank's foreclosure process begins when a loan becomes 45 days past due at which time a preliminary foreclosure letter is sent to the borrower. If the loan becomes 80 days past due, copies of the promissory note and mortgage deed are forwarded to the Bank's attorney for review and an affidavit for a Motion for Summary Judgment is then prepared. An authorized Bank officer signs the affidavit certifying the validity of the documents and verification of the past due amount which is then forwarded to the court. Once a Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, a Period of Redemption (POR) begins which gives the customer 90 days to cure the default. A foreclosure auction date is then set 30 days from the POR expiration date if the default is not cured. 
  In July 2016, the Bank conducted a self-audit of its loans in foreclosure and its foreclosure process and found there were no deficiencies or areas to improve.     For loans sold to the secondary market on which servicing is retained, the Bank follows Freddie Mac's and Fannie Mae's published guidelines and regularly reviews these guidelines for updates and changes to process. All secondary market loans have been sold without recourse in a non-securitized, one-on-one basis. As a result, the Bank has no liability for these loans in the event of a foreclosure. 
   
  Other Real Estate Owned 
  Other real estate owned and repossessed assets ("OREO") are comprised of properties or other assets acquired through a foreclosure proceeding, or acceptance of a deed or title in lieu of foreclosure. Real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at the lower of fair value less estimated cost to sell or the cost of the asset and is not included as part of the allowance for loan loss totals. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   nine   properties owned with a net OREO balance of   $855,000  , net of an allowance for losses of   $162,000  , compared to   December 31, 2015   when there were   14   properties owned with a net OREO balance of   $1.5 million  , net of an allowance for losses of   $162,000   and   September 30, 2015   when there were   17   properties owned with a net OREO balance of   $1.9 million  , net of an allowance for losses of   $409,000  .

The following table presents the composition of other real estate owned: 

Liquidity Management 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had primary sources of liquidity of   $238.1 million  . It is Management's opinion this is sufficient to meet liquidity needs under a broad range of scenarios. The Bank has an additional   $325.1 million   in contingent sources of liquidity, including the Federal Reserve Borrower in Custody program, municipal and corporate securities, and correspondent bank lines of credit. The Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO") establishes guidelines for liquidity in its Asset/Liability policy and monitors internal liquidity measures to manage liquidity exposure. Based on its assessment of the liquidity considerations described above, Management believes the Company's sources of funding will meet anticipated funding needs. 
  Liquidity is the ability of a financial institution to meet maturing liability obligations and customer loan demand.  The Bank's primary source of liquidity is deposits, which funded   68.4%   of total average assets in the first   nine months   of   2016  . While the generally preferred funding strategy is to attract and retain low-cost deposits, the ability to do so is affected by  
  
   Page 64 

competitive interest rates and terms in the marketplace. Other sources of funding include discretionary use of purchased liabilities (e.g., FHLB term advances and other borrowings), cash flows from the securities portfolios and loan repayments. Securities designated as available for sale may also be sold in response to short-term or long-term liquidity needs although Management has no intention to do so at this time. 
  The Bank has a detailed liquidity funding policy and a contingency funding plan that provide for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity. Management has developed quantitative models to estimate needs for contingent funding that could result from unexpected outflows of funds in excess of "business as usual" cash flows. In Management's estimation, risks are concentrated in two major categories: runoff of in-market deposit balances and the inability to renew wholesale sources of funding. Of the two categories, potential runoff of deposit balances would have the most significant impact on contingent liquidity. Our modeling attempts to quantify deposits at risk over selected time horizons. In addition to these unexpected outflow risks, several other "business as usual" factors enter into the calculation of the adequacy of contingent liquidity including payment proceeds from loans and investment securities, maturing debt obligations and maturing time deposits. The Bank has established collateralized borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and also maintains additional collateralized borrowing capacity with the FHLB in excess of levels used in the ordinary course of business as well as Fed Funds lines with three correspondent banks and availability through the Federal Reserve Bank Borrower in Custody program. 
   
  Deposits 
  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , total deposits   increased   by   $130.6 million   or   12.5%   from   December 31, 2015   levels. Low-cost deposits (demand, NOW, and savings accounts)   increased   by   $93.4 million   or   16.1%   in the first   nine months   of   2016  , money market deposits   decreased     $16.3 million   or   17.5%  , and certificates of deposit   increased     $53.5 million   or   14.4%  . Between   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , total deposits   increased   by   $115.4 million   or   10.9%  . Low-cost deposits   increased   by   $98.8 million   or   17.2%  , money market accounts   decreased     $18.5 million   or   19.5%  , and certificates of deposit   increased     $35.1 million   or   9.0%  .  The increase in low-cost deposits year-to-date is consistent with our normal seasonal fluctuation. The majority of the change in certificates of deposit both year-to-date and year-over-year was primarily from a shift in funding strategy between borrowed funds and certificates of deposit. 
   
  Borrowed Funds 
  The Company uses funding from the FHLB of Boston, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and repurchase agreements enabling it to grow its balance sheet and its revenues. This funding may also be used to balance seasonal deposit flows or to carry out interest rate risk management strategies, and is increased to replace or supplement other sources of funding, including core deposits and certificates of deposit. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , borrowed funds   decreased     $69.4 million   or   20.6%   from   December 31, 2015  . Between   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , borrowed funds   decreased   by   $29.3 million   or   9.8%  . This is due to the above mentioned shift in funding strategy between borrowed funds and certificates of deposit.  
   
  Shareholders' Equity 
  Shareholders' equity as of   September 30, 2016   was   $176.0 million  , compared to   $167.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   $167.1 million   as of   September 30, 2015  . The Company's earnings in the first   nine months   of   2016  , net of dividends paid, added to shareholders' equity.  The net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities, presented in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 "Investments   Debt and Equity Securities",   increased   by   $1.6 million   from   December 31, 2015   and now stands at a   $2.7 million  . 
  A cash dividend of   $0.23   per share was declared in the   third quarter   of   2016  . This is equal to what was paid in the second quarter. The dividend payout ratio, which is calculated by dividing dividends declared per share by diluted earnings per share, was   53.13%   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   55.56%   for the same period in   2015  . In determining future dividend payout levels, the Board of Directors carefully analyzes capital requirements and earnings retention, as set forth in the Company's Dividend Policy. The ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its shareholders depends on receipt of dividends from its subsidiary, the Bank. The subsidiary may pay dividends to its parent out of so much of its net profits as the Bank's directors deem appropriate, subject to the limitation that the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year may not exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. The amount available for dividends in   2016   is this year's net income plus   $12.7 million  . 
  On January 9, 2009 the Company issued $25 million in Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, by the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program ("the CPP Shares"). The CPP Shares qualified as Tier 1 capital on the Company's books for regulatory purposes and ranked senior to the Company's common stock and senior or at an equal level in the Company's capital structure to any other shares of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future. In three separate transactions in 2012 and 2013, the Company repurchased all of the CPP shares from the Treasury. 
         Incident to such issuance of the CPP shares, the Company issued to the Treasury warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase up to 225,904 shares of the Company's common stock at a price per share of $16.60 (subject to adjustment). The Warrants (and  
  
   Page 65 

any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Warrants) are freely transferable by Treasury to third parties. The Warrants have a term of ten years and could be exercised by Treasury or a subsequent holder at any time or from time to time during their term. To the extent they had not previously been exercised, the Warrants will expire after ten years. The Warrants were unchanged as a result of the CPP Shares repurchase transactions. 
  In May 2015, the Treasury sold all of the Warrants to private parties.  In accordance with the contractual terms of the Warrants, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and strike price were adjusted at the time of the sale. As a result of this transaction, the number of shares issuable under the Warrants now stands at   226,819   shares with a strike price of   $16.53   per share. 
         Financial institution regulators have established guidelines for minimum capital ratios for banks and bank holding companies. The net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale securities is generally not included in computing regulatory capital. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company adopted the new Basel III regulatory capital framework as approved by the federal banking agencies. The adoption of this new framework modified the calculation of the various capital ratios, added a new ratio, common equity tier 1, and revised the adequately and well capitalized thresholds. Additionally, under the new rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, the Company must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019. The amounts shown below as the adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer include the fully phased-in 2.50% buffer.    
        The Company met each of the well-capitalized ratio guidelines at   September 30, 2016  . The following tables indicate the capital ratios for the Bank and the Company at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments and Contractual Obligations 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedges 
  As part of its overall asset and liability management strategy, the Company periodically uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. The Company's interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and/or liabilities so that change in interest rates does not have a significant adverse effect on net interest income. Derivative instruments that Management periodically uses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy may include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate floor agreements, and interest rate cap agreements.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had two outstanding, off-balance sheet, derivative instruments. These derivative instruments were interest rate swap agreements, with notional principal amounts totaling $50.0 million and an unrealized gain of $90,000. The notional amounts and net unrealized gain (loss) of the financial derivative instruments do not represent exposure to credit loss. The Company is exposed to credit loss only to the extent the counter-party defaults in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the agreements. The credit risk in derivative instruments is mitigated by entering into

transactions with highly-rated counterparties that Management believes to be creditworthy and by limiting the amount of exposure to each counter-party.     At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s derivative instrument counterparties were credit rated  A  by the major credit rating agencies.     The interest rate swap agreements were entered into by the Company to limit its exposure to rising interest rates and were designated as cash flow hedges.

Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market-Risk Management 
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. The First Bancorp, Inc.'s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk. The Bank's Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. All guidelines and policies established by ALCO have been approved by the Board of Directors. 
   
  Asset/Liability Management 
  The primary goal of asset/liability management is to maximize net interest income within the interest rate risk limits set by ALCO. Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of two complementary measures: static gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling. While each measurement has limitations, taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the Company, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. 
  Static gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time. It does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. A gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities that reprice within a specified time period. The Company's cumulative one-year gap at   September 30, 2016   was +  15.95%   of total assets compared to +  5.13%   of total assets at   December 31, 2015  . Core deposits with non-contractual maturities are presented based upon historical patterns of balance attrition and pricing behavior, which are reviewed at least annually. 
  The gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received. Mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age. 
  A summary of the Company's static gap, as of   September 30, 2016  , is presented in the following table: 

The earnings simulation model forecasts capture the impact of changing interest rates on one-year and two-year net interest income. The modeling process calculates changes in interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on the Company's balance sheet. None of the assets used in the simulation are held for trading purposes. The modeling is done for a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates as well as basis risk, as represented by changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships. Management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment. This analysis is also most useful in determining the short-run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals. 
  
   Page 68 

The Company's most recent simulation model projects net interest income would decrease by approximately   1.23%   of stable-rate net interest income if short-term rates affected by Federal Open Market Committee actions fall gradually by one percentage point over the next year, and increase by approximately   0.43%   if rates rise gradually by two percentage points. Both scenarios are well within ALCO's policy limit of a decrease in net interest income of no more than 10.0% given a 2.0% move in interest rates, up or down. Management believes this reflects a reasonable interest rate risk position. In year two, and assuming no additional movement in rates, the model forecasts that net interest income would be lower than that earned in a stable rate environment by   0.52%   in a falling-rate scenario, and higher than that earned in a stable rate environment by   6.37%   in a rising rate scenario, when compared to the year-one base scenario. A summary of the Bank's interest rate risk simulation modeling, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is presented in the following table: 

This dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time and in different interest rate environments. Loans and deposits are projected to maintain stable balances. All maturities, calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in similar assets. Mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning. Non-contractual deposit volatility and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns. The sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed annually and reviewed by ALCO. 
  This sensitivity analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including, among others, the nature and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment/ replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive ability of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 
  A variety of financial instruments can be used to manage interest rate sensitivity. These may include investment securities, interest rate swaps, and interest rate caps and floors. Frequently called interest rate derivatives, interest rate swaps, caps and floors have characteristics similar to securities but possess the advantages of customization of the risk-reward profile of the instrument, minimization of balance sheet leverage and improvement of liquidity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was using interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management. 
  The Company engages an independent consultant to periodically review its interest rate risk position, as well as the effectiveness of simulation modeling and reasonableness of assumptions used. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no significant differences between the views of the independent consultant and Management regarding the Company's interest rate risk exposure. As a result of recent statements made by the Federal Open Market Committee, Management expects that short-term interest rates may increase sometime in the next one-to-three quarters and believes that the current level of interest rate risk is acceptable.

Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
  As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the quarter covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, the Company and its management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Company's management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company reviews its disclosure controls and procedures, which may include its internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company's systems evolve with its business.
