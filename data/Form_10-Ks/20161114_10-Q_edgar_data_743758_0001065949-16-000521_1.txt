FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of CloudCommerce,
Inc.'s ( CloudCommerce,   we,   us,  or the  Company ), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of
management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included.  Operating results for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017.  For further information,
refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the
Company's Form 10K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

This summary of significant accounting policies of CloudCommerce,
Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the
Company's management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the
preparation of the financial statements. 

 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
include the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary ( Indaba Group, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ). All significant inter-company transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. 

  Accounts Receivable  

 The Company extends credit to its customers, who are located
nationwide.  Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal
trade terms.  The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition.  Management reviews accounts receivable on a
regular basis, based on contracted terms and how recently payments have been
received to determine if any such amounts will potentially be uncollected.  The
Company includes any balances that are determined to be uncollectible in its
allowance for doubtful accounts.  After all attempts to collect a receivable
have failed, the receivable is written off.  The balance of the allowance
account at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are $31,859 and $45,584 respectively. 

   Use
of Estimates  

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial
statements.  Significant estimates made in preparing these financial statements
include revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, long-lived
assets, intangible assets, business combinations, the deferred tax valuation
allowance, and the fair value of stock options and warrants. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

   Cash and Cash Equivalents   

  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

  Revenue Recognition  

 The Company recognizes income when the service is
provided or when product is delivered.  We present revenue, net of customer
incentives.  Most of the income is generated from professional services and
site development fees.  We provide online marketing services that we purchase
from third parties.  The gross revenue presented in our statement of operations
is in accordance with ASC 605-45.  We also offer professional services such as
development services.  The fees for development services with multiple
deliverables constitute a separate unit of accounting in accordance with ASC
605-25, which are recognized as the work is performed.   Upfront fees for
development services or other customer services are deferred until certain
implementation or contractual milestones have been achieved.  The terms of
services contracts generally are for periods of less than one year.  The
deferred revenue as of September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ended June 30,
2016 was zero and $331,644, respectively. 

We always strive to satisfy our customers by providing
superior quality and service.  Since we typically bill based on a Time and
Materials basis, there are no returns for work delivered. When discrepancies or
disagreements arise, we do our best to reconcile those by assessing the
situation on a case-by-case basis and determining if any discounts can be
given.  Historically, no significant discounts have been granted. 
 -7-  

Research and Development  

  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
Total research and development costs were zero for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

  Advertising Costs   

  The Company expenses the cost of advertising and
promotional materials when incurred.  Total advertising costs were $48,358 and
$12,070 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

  Fair value of
financial instruments  

  The Company's financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value, due to
the relatively short maturity of these instruments.  As of September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016, the Company's notes payable have stated borrowing rates that
are consistent with those currently available to the Company and, accordingly,
the Company believes the carrying value of these debt instruments approximates
their fair value. 

 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established
a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3
measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable
inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2, defined as inputs other
than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly
observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or
quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable
inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity
to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers
are unobservable. 

We measure certain financial instruments
at fair value on a recurring basis.  As of September 30, 2016 and the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2016, the Company had no assets or liabilities that are
required to be valued on a recurring basis.  

Property
and Equipment  

  Property and equipment are stated at cost, and are
depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives: 

Furniture, fixtures  
  equipment 

7 Years 

Computer equipment 

5 Years 

Commerce server 

5 Years 

Computer software 

3 - 5 Years 

Leasehold improvements 

Length of the lease 

Depreciation expenses were $6,137
and $737 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

 The Company reviews its long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine
recoverability of a long-lived asset, management evaluates whether the
estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from the asset are less than its
carrying amount. If impairment is indicated, the long-lived asset would be
written down to fair value. Fair value is determined by an evaluation of
available price information at which assets could be bought or sold, including
quoted market prices, if available, or the present value of the estimated
future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions. 

  Indefinite
Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets   

 The Company accounts for business
combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC
805,  Business Combinations,  where the total purchase price is allocated to the
tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the
information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from
acquisition date, after obtaining more information  

-8-  

regarding, among
other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary
estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and
identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as
goodwill. 

 The Company tests for indefinite lived
intangibles and goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its
policies, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived
intangibles and goodwill at June 30, 2016, and determined there was no
impairment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill. 

  Business
Combinations   

 The Company allocates the fair value of
purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and
intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of
the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these
identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations
require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially
with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain
intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows
from acquired customer lists, acquired technology, and trade names from a
market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management's
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,
but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual
results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one
year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are
recorded to earnings. 

  Concentrations
of Business and Credit Risk  

 The
Company operates in a single industry segment.  The Company markets its
services to companies and individuals in many industries and geographic
locations.  The Company's operations are subject to rapid technological
advancement and intense competition in the SAAS industry. Accounts receivable
represent financial instruments with potential credit risk.  The Company
typically offers its customers credit terms.  The Company makes periodic
evaluations of the credit worthiness of its enterprise customers and other than
obtaining deposits pursuant to its policies, it generally does not require
collateral.  In the event of nonpayment, the Company has the ability to
terminate services. 

  Stock-Based
Compensation  

 The Company addressed the accounting for share-based payment
transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for
either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on
the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. The transactions are accounted for
using a fair-value-based method and recognized as expenses in our statement of
income.    

 Stock-based
compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the
portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest.  Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, included compensation expense for
the stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of
September 30, 2016 based on the grant date fair value estimated.  Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest,
or has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.  Forfeitures are estimated at
the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.  The stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $126,531 and $105,293, respectively.  

  Basic and Diluted Net
Income (Loss) per Share Calculations  

 Income
(Loss) per Share dictates the calculation of basic earnings per share and
diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to
basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include
the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive. The shares for employee options, warrants and convertible notes
were used in the calculation of the income per share. 

 For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company has excluded 123,000,000 options, 10,000 Series A Preferred shares
convertible into 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 18,025 Series B Preferred
shares convertible into 450,625,000 shares of common stock, and shares issuable
from $88,749 in convertible notes convertible into 22,187,250 shares of common
stock, because their impact on the loss per share is anti-dilutive. 

-10-  

For the
three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company
has excluded 126,000,000 options, 28,019,163 warrants outstanding, and 374,607,000
shares underlying $1,498,428 in convertible notes, because their impact on the
loss per share is anti-dilutive. 

 Dilutive per share amounts
are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and
potentially dilutive securities, using the treasury stock method if their
effect would be dilutive.  

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

 Management reviewed
accounting pronouncements issued during the three months ended September 30,
2016, and no pronouncements were adopted during the period.   

LIQUIDITY
AND OPERATIONS 

The Company had net loss of $214,570 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and net loss of $4,754,677 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, and net cash used in operating activities
of $166,416 and $173,976 for the same periods, respectively. 

 While the
Company expects that its capital needs in the foreseeable future may be met by
cash-on-hand and projected positive cash-flow, there is no assurance that the
Company will be able to generate enough positive cash flow or have sufficient
capital to finance its growth and business operations, or that such capital
will be available on terms that are favorable to the Company or at all.  In the
current financial environment, it could become difficult for the Company to
obtain equipment leases and other business financing.  There is no
assurance that the Company would be able to obtain additional working capital
through the private placement of common stock or from any other source. 

  Going Concern  

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of
operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business.  The accompanying financial statements do not
reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.  The Company does not generate significant
revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among
other things, an additional cash infusion. The Company has obtained funds from
its shareholders since its inception. It is management's plan to generate
additional working capital from increasing sales from its desktop and mobile
service offerings, and then continue to pursue its business plan and purposes. 

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS 

Indaba Group, LLC  

 On
October 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Indaba Group, LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company.  As of that date, the Company's operating
subsidiary, Warp 9, Inc., a Delaware corporation, merged with Indaba Group, LLC
and the name of the combined subsidiary was changed to Indaba Group, Inc.
( Indaba ).  The total purchase price of two million dollars ($2,000,000)
was paid in the form of the issuance of ten thousand (10,000) shares of the
Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, at a liquidation preference of
two hundred dollars ($200) per share and payment of working capital surplus in
the amount of $55,601.  As of the date of closing, Ryan Shields and Blake Gindi, two of the owners of Indaba Group, LLC, were appointed to the CloudCommerce
Board of Directors.  

 Under the purchase method of accounting, the transactions
were valued for accounting purposes at $2,000,000, which was the fair value of
Indaba at the time of acquisition. The assets and liabilities of Indaba were
recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. Since
the Company determined there were no other separately identifiable intangible
assets, any difference between the cost of the acquired entity and the fair
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
The acquisition date estimated fair value of the consideration transferred
consisted of the following: 

-10-  

As of September 30,
2016, the Company has recorded an estimated fair value of the intangible assets
of Indaba based on a preliminary purchase price allocation prepared by
management.  As a result, during the preliminary purchase price allocation
period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, we may
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the
corresponding offset to goodwill. After the preliminary purchase price
allocation period, we record adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities
assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in our operating
results in the period in which the adjustments were determined.  

Pro forma results  

 The following tables set forth the unaudited pro forma
results of the Company as if the acquisition of Indaba had taken place on the
first day of the periods presented. These combined results are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may have been achieved had the companies been
combined as of the first day of the periods presented. 

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Domain Name  

 On
June 26, 2015, the Company purchased the rights to the domain
 CLOUDCOMMERCE.COM , from a private party at a purchase price of $20,000, plus
transaction costs of $202, which will be used as the main landing page for the
Company.  The total recorded cost of this domain of $20,202 has been included
in other assets on the balance sheet.  As of September 30, 2016, we determined
that this domain has an indefinite useful life, and as such, is not included in
depreciation and amortization expense.  The Company will assess this intangible
asset annually for impairment, in addition to it being classified with
indefinite useful life. 

  Trademark  

 On
September 22, 2015, the Company purchased the trademark rights of
 CLOUDCOMMERCE , from a private party at a purchase price of $10,000.  The
total recorded cost of this trademark of $10,000 has been included in other
assets on the balance sheet.  The trademark expires in 2020 and may be renewed
for an additional 10 years.  Therefore, as of September 30, 2015, we determined
that this intangible asset has a definite useful life of 174 months, and as
such, will be included in depreciation and amortization expense.  For the
period ended September 30, 2016, the Company included $172 in depreciation and
amortization expense related to this trademark. 

  Non-Compete Agreements  

 On October 1, 2015, the
Company acquired Indaba from three members of the limited liability company. 
At that time, we retained two of the members, who currently serve as the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of Indaba.  Both employees have
non-compete agreements in place to protect the Company against the risk of
either employee leaving Indaba to compete directly with us.  We have calculated
the value of those non-compete agreements at $201,014, with a useful life of 3
years, which coincides with the term of the non-compete agreement.  This amount
will be included in depreciation and amortization expense until September 30,
2018.  For the period ended September 30, 2016, the
Company included $16,751 in depreciation and amortization expense related to
these non-compete agreements. 

  Customer List  

 On October 1, 2015, the
Company acquired Indaba, which brought an increase in revenue and many new
customers.  We have calculated the value of the customer list at $447,171, with
a useful life of 3 years.  This amount will be included in depreciation and
amortization expense until September 30, 2018.  For
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company included $37,264 in
depreciation and amortization expense related to the customer list.

NOTES
PAYABLE 

During the quarter ended December 31,
2015, the Company signed addenda to each of its outstanding convertible notes,
fixing the conversion price at $0.004.  Before the addenda, the conversion
price for each of the notes was tied to the trading price of the Company's
common stock.  Because of that fluctuation, the Company was required to report
derivative gains and losses each quarter, which was included in earnings, and
an overall derivative liability balance on the balance sheet.  Since the
addenda, the Company has eliminated the derivative liability balance on the
balance sheet and discontinued the gain/loss reporting on the income statement.

STOCK
OPTIONS AND WARRANTS 

Stock Options  

 On July 10, 2003, the Company adopted
the Warp 9, Inc. Stock Option Plan for directors, executive officers, and employees
of and key consultants to the Company.  Pursuant to the now terminated plan,
the Company was authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of common stock.  The plan
was administered by the Company's Board of Directors, and options granted under
the plan could be either incentive options or nonqualified options.  Each
option was exercisable in full or in installment and at such time as designated
by the Board.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan or of any option
agreement, each option expired on the date specified in the option agreement,
which date was to be no later than the tenth anniversary of the date on which
the option was granted (fifth anniversary in the case of an incentive option
granted to a greater-than-10% stockholder).  The purchase price per share of
the common stock under each incentive option was to be no less than the fair market
value of the common stock on the date the option was granted (110% of the fair market
value in the case of a greater-than-10% stockholder). The purchase price per
share of the common stock under each nonqualified option was to be specified by
the Board at the time the option is granted, and could be less than, equal to
or greater than the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date
such nonqualified option was granted, but was to be no less than the par value
of shares of common stock.  The plan provided specific language as to the
termination of options granted thereunder.  

  The Company used the
historical industry index to calculate volatility, since the Company's stock
history did not represent the expected future volatility of the Company's
common stock.  No stock options were issued during the quarter ended September
30, 2016.  The fair value of options granted during the year ended June 30,
2016, was determined using the Black Scholes method with the following
assumptions:

A summary of the Company's stock option activity
and related information follows: 

As of
September 30, 2016, the intrinsic value of the stock options was approximately
$1,613,550, and stock option expense for the three months ended September 30,
2016 was $126,531.  

 The Black
Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options, which do not have vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. 

 The weighted average remaining contractual life
of options outstanding, as of September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

Warrants  

 During the periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company issued no warrants for services.  A summary of the Company's
warrant activity and related information follows:

22, 2016, all warrant holders exercised their outstanding warrants, on a

the same customers that comprise the concentrations with the revenues discussed
above. 

COMMITMENTS 

Operating
Leases  

 On March 1, 2016, the
Company moved into office space located at 1933 Cliff Drive, Suite 1, Santa
Barbara, CA 93109, on a month-to-month arrangement, for approximately $3,000
per month.   

 On December 10, 2012,
the management of Indaba signed a lease which commenced January 16, 2013 for
approximately 3,300 square feet at 2854 Larimer Street, Denver, CO 80205, for approximately
$3,500 per month.  The original lease term expired February 28, 2016, but was
extended until February 28, 2017, at a rate of $5,800 per month.   

 The following is a
schedule, by years, of future minimum rental payments required under the operating
lease.   

Total lease expense for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$26,296 and $18,804, respectively.  The Company is also required to pay its pro
rata share of taxes, building maintenance costs, and insurance in according to
the lease agreement.   

 On May 21, 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with
the landlord of our previous location, to make monthly payments on past due
rent totaling $227,052.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will
make monthly payments of $350 on a reduced balance of $40,250.  Upon payment of
$40,250, the Company will record a gain on extinguishment of debt of $186,802. 
As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded the outstanding balance under
this settlement agreement as a long term notes payable, with the current
portion of the debt recorded in accrued expenses.  As of September 30, 2016,
the Company owed $30,100 on the outstanding reduced payment terms. 

  Legal Matters  

 The Company may be involved in legal actions and claims arising in the
ordinary course of business, from time to time, none of which at the time are
considered to be material to the Company's business or financial condition.

non-cash financing activities. 

 14.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

 Management has evaluated subsequent events according to ASC TOPIC 855

 October 2016 Note ) in the amount of $500,000, at which time an
initial advance of $36,000 was received to cover operational expenses.  The
October 2016 Note bears interest at a rate of 5% per year, is payable upon
demand, but in no case later than October 3, 2019.  The Company is only required to repay the amount
funded and the Company is not required to repay any unfunded portion of the

   Item 2.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

  Cautionary Statements  

  The following Management's
Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The
Management's Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of
historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words  believe, 
 plan,   intend,   anticipate,   target,   estimate,   expect,  and the like,
and/or future-tense or conditional constructions ( will,   may,   could, 
 should,  etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in
this prospectus. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of several factors including, but not limited to, those noted under
 Risk Factors  of the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this
quarterly report .

together with our subsidiary, provides advanced e-commerce services to leading
brands. Our customers depend on us to help them compete effectively in the
worldwide e-commerce market. Our comprehensive services include: (1)
development of highly customized and sophisticated online stores, (2) real-time

 We believe our services allow our clients to lower
costs and focus on promoting and marketing their brand, product line, and
website while leveraging the investments we have made in technology and
infrastructure to operate a dynamic digital presence. 

  Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and
capital resources, are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments,
particularly those related to the determination of the estimated recoverable
amounts of trade accounts receivable, impairment of long-lived assets, revenue
recognition, and deferred tax assets.  We believe the following critical accounting
policies require more significant judgment and estimates used in the
preparation of the financial statements. 

 We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable
to make required payments.  Management specifically analyzes the age of customer
balances, historical bad debt experience, customer credit-worthiness, and
changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability
of our trade accounts receivable balances.  If we determine that the financial
conditions of any of our customers has deteriorated, whether due to customer
specific or general economic issues, increases in the allowance may be made. Accounts
receivable are written off when all collection attempts have failed. 

 We follow the provisions of ASC 605-10-25,
that four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is
persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or
service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv)
collection is reasonably assured. 
 -18-  

Income taxes are accounted for under the
asset and liability method. Under this method, to the extent that we believe
that the deferred tax asset is not likely to be recovered, a valuation
allowance is provided. In making this determination, we consider estimated
future taxable income and taxable timing differences expected in the future.  Actual
results may differ from those estimates. 

  Fair value of financial
instruments  

 The Company's financial
instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value, due to
the relatively short maturity of these instruments.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company's notes
payable have stated borrowing rates that are consistent with those currently
available to the Company and, accordingly, the Company believes the carrying
value of these debt instruments approximates their fair value. 

 Fair value is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC
Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurements).  These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable
inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2, defined as inputs other
than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly
observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or
quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable
inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity
to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers
are unobservable. 

We measure certain financial instruments
at fair value on a recurring basis.  The Company had no assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016. 

  Results of Operations for
the Three Months Ended   September
30, 2016, compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.  

 REVENUE 

 Total revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $979,115 to $1,092,674, compared
to $113,559 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The
increase was primarily due to revenue from the operations of our subsidiary
Indaba, which we acquired in October 2015. 

 SALARIES AND OUTSIDE SERVICES 

 Salaries and outside services
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $577,354 to $872,806,
compared to $295,452 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The
increase was primarily due to our increased operations upon acquiring Indaba. 

 SELLING, GENERAL, AND
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 

 Selling, general, and
administrative ( SG A ) expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016 increased by $150,690 to $250,172, compared to $99,482 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was due to higher
operating expenses, related to the acquisition of Indaba. 

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

 Research and development
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015
were both $0.   

 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION 

 Depreciation and amortization expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased
by $59,588 to $60,325, compared to $737 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the
amortization of intangible assets acquired through the Indaba acquisition. 

 OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE 

 Total other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $4,369,862
to net other income of $2,590, compared to net other expense of $4,367,272 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
The increase was primarily due to the losses recorded as a result of the
conversion of debt to equity in addition to a decrease in fair value of our
derivative liabilities in 2015. 
 -19-  

NET LOSS 

 The consolidated net loss for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $214,570, compared to the
consolidated net loss of $4,754,677 for the three months ended September 30,
2015.  The decrease in net loss for the period was primarily due to changes in derivative liability, partially offset by interest expense and additional operating costs of
Indaba.   

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 The Company had a net working
capital deficit (i.e. the difference between current assets and current liabilities)
of ($975,743) at September 30, 2016 compared to a net working capital deficit
of ($923,480) at fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.   

 Cash flow used in operating activities
was  $166,416 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash
flow used in operating activities of  $173,976 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.  The decrease in cash flow used in operating activities of $7,560 was
primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in accounts
receivable, partially offset by the
recognition of a gain from the sale of IP address blocks.  For many years, the
Company has held the rights to blocks of IP addresses, related to maintaining
web servers in-house.  Because the Company no longer maintains an in-house data
center, it was deemed unnecessary to retain the rights of the IP addresses, so
the rights to those addresses were sold. 

 Cash flow provided by investing
activities was $10,761 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to cash flow used in investing activities of  $10,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in cash
flow provided by investing activities of $20,761 was primarily due to the sale
of IP Addresses. 

 Cash flow provided by financing
activities was $117,266 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $193,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease
in cash flow provided by financing activities of $75,734 was due to a decrease
in borrowing and increase of dividends paid on Series A Preferred stock. 

 The Company has recently been
incurring operating losses and experiencing negative cash flow, funded through
established borrowing arrangements.  In the future, if the Company does not
have sufficient cash-on-hand to fund operations, we expect to draw funds from
those borrowing arrangements.  Our borrowing activity is generally determined
by operations and the cash on hand.  The Company typically maintains a cash
balance of two or three weeks of our operating requirements. 

 Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or
equity-backed securities may dilute current stockholders' ownership percentages
and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity
securities. The terms of the securities issued by us in future capital
transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include
preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other
derivative securities which may have a further dilutive effect. 

Furthermore, any additional debt or equity or other financing that
we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are
unable to obtain required additional capital, we may have to curtail our growth
plans or cut back on existing business. Further, we may not be able to continue
operations if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations. 

We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing,
including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law
compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may
also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain
securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may
adversely impact our reported financial results. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements  

 None. 

  Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK  

 Not Applicable. 

  Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

  Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  

 Management, with the
participation of the Company's executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by
this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 -20-  

Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective due to the following material weaknesses: 

 1. lack of
segregation of duties; and  

 2. failure
to implement accounting controls of acquired businesses. 

 To the extent reasonably possible given
our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned
weaknesses. 

 Our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect
that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will
prevent all error or fraud.  A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs.  Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.  

 To address the material
weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures
in an effort to ensure our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Accordingly, management believes that the financial
statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented. 

  No Attestation Report by Independent Registered Accountant  

 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2016 has not been audited by our independent
registered public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption from such
requirement as a smaller reporting company. 

  Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting  

 There have been no changes in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's
last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.   

  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness
of Controls   

 The Company's management does not expect that its
disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will
prevent or detect all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.  The design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Further,
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or management override of the controls.  The design of any system
of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Projections
of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risks.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.  

  PART II.  - OTHER INFORMATION  

  Item 1.  LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS  

 The Company may be involved in
legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business from time
to time in the future. However, at this time there are no current legal
proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of
which any of their property is the subject.
