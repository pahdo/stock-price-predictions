FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, those under  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Part I are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements use words such as  anticipate,   project,   expect,   plan,   goal,   forecast,   intend,   should,   would,   could,   believe,   may,  and similar expressions and statements regarding our plans and objectives for future operations.  These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions and those of our general partner using currently available information and expectations as of the date hereof, are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties.  Although we and our general partner believe that such expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, neither we nor our general partner can give assurance that our expectations will prove to be correct.  All statements concerning our expectations for future results of operations are based on forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions.  Our forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected.  Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to: 
             
    risks and uncertainties with respect to the actual quantities of petroleum products and crude oil shipped on our pipelines and/or terminalled, stored or throughput in our terminals; 
                
    the economic viability of HollyFrontier Corporation, Alon USA, Inc. and our other customers; 
                
    the demand for refined petroleum products in markets we serve; 
                
    our ability to purchase and integrate future acquired operations; 
                
    our ability to complete previously announced or contemplated acquisitions; 
                
    the availability and cost of additional debt and equity financing; 
                
    the possibility of reductions in production or shutdowns at refineries utilizing our pipeline and terminal facilities; 
                
    the effects of current and future government regulations and policies; 
                
    our operational efficiency in carrying out routine operations and capital construction projects; 
                
    the possibility of terrorist attacks and the consequences of any such attacks; 
                
    general economic conditions; and 
                
    other financial, operational and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
       
  Cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are set forth in this Form 10-Q, including without limitation, the forward-looking statements that are referred to above.  When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the known material risk factors and other cautionary statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and in  Risk Factors.   All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q and all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.  The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and, other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1: 
    Description of Business and Presentation of Financial Statements 
       
  Holly Energy Partners, L.P. ( HEP ), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a publicly held master limited partnership which is   39%   owned (including the   2%   general partner interest) by HollyFrontier Corporation ( HFC ) and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016.  We commenced operations on July 13, 2004, upon the completion of our initial public offering.  In these consolidated financial statements, the words  we,   our,   ours  and  us  refer to HEP unless the context otherwise indicates. 
    
  We operate in one reportable segment which represents the aggregation of our petroleum product and crude pipelines business and terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units. 
    
  We own and operate petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage and loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that support HFC s refining and marketing operations in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and Alon USA, Inc. s ( Alon ) refinery in Big Spring, Texas.  Additionally, we own a   75%   interest in UNEV Pipeline, LLC ( UNEV ), a   50%   interest in Frontier Aspen, LLC, a 50% interest in Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC ( Osage ), a 50% interest in Cheyenne Pipeline LLC and a   25%   interest in SLC Pipeline LLC. 
    
  We generate revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through our pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling and storing refined products and other hydrocarbons, providing other services at our storage tanks and terminals and by charging fees for processing hydrocarbon feedstocks through our refinery processing units.  We do not take ownership of products that we transport, terminal, store or process, and therefore, we are not exposed directly to changes in commodity prices. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our results for the interim periods.  Such adjustments are considered to be of a normal recurring nature.  Although certain notes and other information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted, we believe that the disclosures in these consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that will be realized for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  On September 16, 2016, we entered into a common unit purchase agreement in which certain purchasers agreed to purchase in a private placement   3,420,000   common units representing limited partnership interests, at a price of   $30.18   per common unit. The private placement closed on October 3, 2016, and we received proceeds of approximately   $103 million  , which were used to finance a portion of the Woods Cross acquisition discussed below. The purchase agreement is classified as an equity transaction, and as a result, no amounts are recorded in the consolidated financial statements until settlement.  As a result of the private placement, HFC now owns a   37%   interest in us (including the 2% general partner interest).  To maintain the 2% general partner interest, HFC contributed   $2.1 million   to HEP in October 2016.  Additionally, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers, which requires that we file a registration statement with the SEC within 60 days following the closing of the private placement to register the purchased units under the Securities Act. The registration statement will be automatically effective and the units fully transferable upon filing. 
    
  On July 19, 2016, we closed a private placement of   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6%   senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the  6% Senior Notes ).  We used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement.  
    
  On May 10, 2016, we established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of   $200 million  .  We intend to use our net proceeds for general partnership purposes. 
    
  Acquisitions 
    
  Woods Cross Operating 
  Effective October 1, 2016, we acquired all the membership interests of  Woods Cross Operating LLC ( Woods Cross Operating ), a wholly owned subsidiary of HFC, which owns the newly constructed atmospheric distillation tower, fluid catalytic cracking unit, and polymerization unit located at HFC s Woods Cross Refinery, for cash consideration of    $278 million  .  The consideration was funded with approximately   $103 million   in proceeds from the private placement and the balance with borrowings under our credit

facility.  In connection with this transaction, we entered into   15  -year tolling agreements containing minimum quarterly throughput commitments from HFC that provide minimum annualized revenues of   $56.7 million  . 
    
  The Utah Division of Air Quality issued an air quality permit to HollyFrontier Woods Cross Refining LLC ( HFC Woods Cross Refining ) authorizing the expansion units at the Woods Cross Refinery.  The appeal proceeding challenging the Utah Department of Environmental Quality s decision to uphold the air quality permit is still pending. The purchase agreement provides us with the option to compel HFC Woods Cross Refining to repurchase the interests for the full purchase price paid if the assets are required to be idled for 90 or more days as a result of a final decision in the appeal proceedings. If we  do not exercise the foregoing right and, by reason of the appeal proceedings, the assets must be modified, then HFC will be responsible for the costs of such modifications.  
    
  As we are a consolidated variable interest entity ( VIE ) of HFC, this transaction will be recorded as a transfer between entities under common control and reflect HFC s carrying basis in the net assets acquired.  Also,  during the fourth quarter of 2016,  we will retrospectively adjust our financial position and operating results as if Wood Cross Operating were a consolidated subsidiary for all periods while we were under common control of HFC.  Assuming this acquisition was effective as of September 30, 2016, our assets, liabilities and equity would have been retrospectively adjusted to include Woods Cross Operating s assets, liabilities and equity as presented below: 

This retrospective adjustment will not have significant impact on our operating results prior to September 30, 2016, since the units became operational in the second and third quarters of 2016. 
    
  Cheyenne Pipeline 
  On June 3, 2016, we acquired a   50%   interest in Cheyenne Pipeline LLC, owner of the Cheyenne Pipeline, in exchange for a contribution of   $42.6 million   in cash to Cheyenne Pipeline LLC.  Cheyenne Pipeline LLC will continue to be operated by an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ( Plains ), which owns the remaining 50% interest.  The   87  -mile crude oil pipeline runs from Fort Laramie to Cheyenne, Wyoming and has an   80,000   barrel per day ( bpd ) capacity.  
    
  Tulsa Tanks 
  On March 31, 2016, we acquired crude oil tanks located at HFC s Tulsa refinery from an affiliate of Plains for   $39.5 million  .  In 2009, HFC sold these tanks to Plains and leased them back, and due to HFC s continuing interest in the tanks, HFC accounted for the transaction as a financing arrangement. Accordingly, the tanks remained on HFC s balance sheet and were depreciated for accounting purposes. 
    
  As we are a consolidated VIE of HFC, this transaction was recorded as a transfer between entities under common control and reflects HFC s carrying basis in the net assets acquired.  We have retrospectively adjusted our financial position and operating results as if these crude oil tanks were owned for all periods while we were under common control of HFC. The 2015 consolidated income statement was adjusted to reflect a   $0.2 million   and a   $0.6 million   increase in operating costs and expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The consolidated balance sheet was adjusted to reflect increases of   $9.3 million   in net properties and equipment,   $0.1 million   in other long-term liabilities and   $9.2 million   in general partner interest at   December 31, 2015  . The consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , reflects these changes in cash flows from investing and financing activities. 
    
  Osage 
  On February 22, 2016, HFC obtained a   50%   membership interest in Osage in a non-monetary exchange for a   20  -year terminalling services agreement, whereby a subsidiary of Magellan Midstream Partners ( Magellan ) will provide terminalling services for all HFC products originating in Artesia, New Mexico requiring terminalling in or through El Paso, Texas. Osage is the owner of the Osage Pipeline, a   135  -mile pipeline that transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to HFC s El Dorado Refinery in Kansas

and also connects to the Jayhawk pipeline serving the CHS Inc. refinery in McPherson, Kansas. The Osage Pipeline is the primary pipeline supplying HFC s El Dorado refinery with crude oil. 
    
  Concurrent with this transaction, we entered into a non-monetary exchange with HFC, whereby we received HFC s interest in Osage in exchange for our El Paso terminal. Under this exchange, we agreed to build two connections on our south products pipeline system that will permit HFC access to Magellan s El Paso terminal. Effective upon the closing of this exchange, we are the named operator of the Osage Pipeline and are working to transition into that role.  Since we are a consolidated VIE of HFC, this transaction was recorded as a transfer between entities under common control and reflects HFC s carrying basis of its 50% membership interest in Osage of   $44.5 million   offset by our net carrying basis in the El Paso terminal of   $12.1 million   with the difference treated as a contribution from HFC.  The carrying value of our 50% membership interest in Osage of   $44.5 million   exceeds the amount of the underlying equity in net assets recorded by Osage by   $33.1 million  .   
    
  El Dorado Operating 
  On   November 1, 2015  , we acquired from a wholly owned subsidiary of HFC, all the outstanding membership interests in El Dorado Operating LLC ( El Dorado Operating ), which owns the newly constructed naphtha fractionation and hydrogen generation units at HFC s El Dorado refinery, for cash consideration of   $62.0 million  .  In connection with this transaction, we entered into   15  -year tolling agreements containing minimum quarterly throughput commitments from HFC that provide minimum annualized revenues of   $15.2 million  .   
    
  As we are a consolidated VIE of HFC, this transaction was recorded as a transfer between entities under common control and reflects HFC s carrying basis in El Dorado Operating s assets and liabilities.  We have retrospectively adjusted our financial position and operating results as if El Dorado Operating were a consolidated subsidiary for all periods while we were under common control of HFC.   The consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ending   September 30, 2015  , reflects a   $24.4 million   recast between investing activities and financing activities.  
    
  Frontier Pipeline 
  On August 31, 2015, we purchased a   50%   interest in Frontier Aspen LLC (formerly known as Frontier Pipeline Company), which owns a   289  -mile crude oil pipeline running from Casper, Wyoming to Frontier Station, Utah (the "Frontier Pipeline"), from an affiliate of Enbridge, Inc. for cash consideration of   $54.6 million  .  Frontier Pipeline will continue to be operated by an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., which owns the remaining 50% interest.  The Frontier Pipeline has a   72,000   bpd capacity and supplies Canadian and Rocky Mountain crudes to Salt Lake City area refiners through a connection to the SLC Pipeline.  
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, an accounting standard update was issued requiring revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration for these goods or services.  This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2018. We are evaluating the impact of this standard. 
    
  Consolidation 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued a standard that modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2016.  This standard had no impact on the entities we consolidate. 
    
  Financial Assets and Liabilities 
  In January 2016, an accounting standard update was issued requiring changes in the accounting and disclosures for financial instruments. This standard will become effective beginning with our 2018 reporting year. We are evaluating the impact of this standard. 
    
  Leases 
  In February 2016, an accounting standard update was issued requiring leases to be measured and recognized as a lease liability, with a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2019, and we are evaluating the impact of this standard.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) Continued 

Earnings Per Unit 
  In April 2015, an accounting standard update was issued requiring changes to the allocation of the earnings or losses of a transferred business for periods before the date of a dropdown of net assets accounted for as a common control transaction entirely to the general partner for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit.  We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016.  In connection with the dropdown of assets from HFC s Tulsa refinery on March 31, 2016, we reduced net income by   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This reduction had no impact on the historical earnings per unit. 
    
  Share-Based Compensation 
  In March 2016, Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  was issued which simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective January 1, 2017, and will have an immaterial impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Note 2: 
    Financial Instruments 
       
  Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and interest rate swaps.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.  Debt consists of outstanding principal under our revolving credit agreement (which approximates fair value as interest rates are reset frequently at current interest rates) and our fixed interest rate senior notes. 
    
  Fair value measurements are derived using inputs (assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability) including assumptions about risk.  GAAP categorizes inputs used in fair value measurements into three broad levels as follows: 
             
    (Level 1) Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    (Level 2) Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    (Level 3) Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes valuation techniques that involve significant unobservable inputs. 
       
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our senior notes and interest rate swaps were as follows: 

Level 2 Financial Instruments 
  Our senior notes and interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.  The fair value of the senior notes is based on market values provided by a third-party bank, which were derived using market quotes for similar type debt instruments.  The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on the net present value of expected future cash flows related to both variable and fixed-rate legs of the swap agreement.  This measurement is computed using the forward London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) yield curve, a market-based observable input. 
    
  See Note 6 for additional information on these instruments.

    Properties and Equipment    
       
  The carrying amounts of our properties and equipment are as follows: 

(1) Retrospectively adjusted as described in Note 1. 
    
  We capitalized   $0.5 million   and   $0.7 million   in interest attributable to construction projects during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Depreciation expense was   $42.1 million   and   $40.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  

Note 4: 
    Transportation Agreements 
       
  Our transportation agreements represent a portion of the total purchase price of certain assets acquired from Alon in   2005   and from HFC in   2008  .  The Alon agreement is being amortized over   30   years ending   2035   (the initial   15  -year term of the agreement plus an expected   15  -year extension period), and the HFC agreement is being amortized over   15   years ending   2023   (the term of the HFC agreement). 
    
  The carrying amounts of our transportation agreements are as follows: 

Amortization expense was   $5.2 million   for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  We have additional transportation agreements with HFC resulting from historical transactions consisting of pipeline, terminal and tankage assets contributed to us or acquired from HFC.  These transactions occurred while we were a consolidated VIE of HFC; therefore, our basis in these agreements is zero and does not reflect a step-up in basis to fair value.

Note 5: 
    Employees, Retirement and Incentive Plans 
       
  Direct support for our operations is provided by Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. ( HLS ), an HFC subsidiary, which utilizes personnel employed by HFC who are dedicated to performing services for us.  Their costs, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, benefits and other direct costs, are charged to us monthly in accordance with an omnibus agreement that we have with HFC.  These employees participate in the retirement and benefit plans of HFC.  Our share of retirement and benefit plan costs was   $1.4 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $4.3 million   and   $4.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Under HLS s secondment agreement with HFC (the  Secondment Agreement ), certain employees of HFC are seconded to HLS to provide operational and maintenance services for certain of our processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets, and HLS reimburses HFC for its prorated portion of the wages, benefits, and other costs related to these employees. 
  We have a Long-Term Incentive Plan for employees and non-employee directors who perform services for us.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan consists of   four   components: restricted or phantom units, performance units, unit options and unit appreciation rights.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   two   types of incentive-based awards outstanding, which are described below.  The compensation cost charged against income was   $0.7 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $1.9 million   and   $2.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  We currently purchase units in the open market instead of issuing new units for settlement of all unit awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   2,500,000   units were authorized to be granted under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, of which   1,487,162   have not yet been granted, assuming no forfeitures of the unvested units and full achievement of goals for the unvested performance units. 
    
  Restricted and Phantom Units 
  Under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant restricted units to non-employee directors and selected employees who perform services for us, with most awards vesting over a period of   one   to   three   years.  Although full ownership of the units does not transfer to the recipients until the units vest, the recipients have distribution and voting rights on these units from the date of grant. 
    
  In addition, we previously granted phantom units to certain employees.  All outstanding phantom units vested in 2015, and no phantom units are currently outstanding.  Vested units were paid in common units.  Full ownership of the units transferred to the recipients at vesting, and the recipients did not have voting or distribution rights on these units until they vested. 
    
  The fair value of each restricted unit award is measured at the market price as of the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. 
    
  A summary of restricted unit activity and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is presented below: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $1.1 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted unit  grants, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1   year.

Performance Units 
  Under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant performance units to selected executives who perform services for us.  Performance units granted are payable in common units at the end of a three-year performance period based upon the growth in our distributable cash flow per common unit over the performance period.  As of   September 30, 2016  , estimated unit payouts for outstanding nonvested performance unit awards ranged between   125%   and   150%   of the target number of performance units granted. 
    
  We granted   10,725   performance units during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Performance units granted in 2015 and during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , vest over a three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018 and are payable in HEP common units.  The number of units actually earned will be based on the growth of our distributable cash flow per common unit over the performance period, and can range from   50%   to   150%   of the target number of performance units granted.  Although common units are not transferred to the recipients until the performance units vest, the recipients have distribution rights with respect to the common units from the date of grant.  
    
  A summary of performance unit activity and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is presented below:   

The grant-date fair value of performance units vested and transferred to recipients during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $1.1 million  .  Based on the weighted average fair value of performance units outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , of   $0.8 million  , there was   $0.6 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested performance units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.9   years. 

Credit Agreement 
  In March 2016, we amended our  senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) expiring in November 2018, increasing the size of the Credit Agreement from   $850 million   to   $1.2 billion  .  The Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes.  It is also available to fund letters of credit up to a   $50 million   sub-limit.  
    
  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.  Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement involves recourse to HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P. ( HEP Logistics ), our general partner, and is guaranteed by our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Any recourse to HEP Logistics would be limited to the extent of its assets, which other than its investment in us are not significant.  We may prepay all loans at any time without penalty, except for payment of certain breakage and related costs. 
    
  The Credit Agreement imposes certain requirements on us with which we were in compliance as of   September 30, 2016  , including: a prohibition against distribution to unitholders if, before or after the distribution, a potential default or an event of default as defined in the agreement would occur; limitations on our ability to incur debt, make loans, acquire other companies, change the nature of our business, enter into a merger or consolidation, or sell assets; and covenants that require maintenance of a specified EBITDA to interest expense ratio, total debt to EBITDA ratio and senior debt to EBITDA ratio.  If an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, the lenders will be able to accelerate the maturity of the debt and exercise other rights and remedies.  We were in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2016.  
    
  Senior Notes  
  We have   $300 million   in aggregate principal amount outstanding of   6.5%   senior notes (the  6.5% Senior Notes ) maturing March 2020.

On July 19, 2016, we closed a private placement of   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6%   senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the  6% Senior Notes  and together with the 6.5% Senior Notes, the  Senior Notes ).  We used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement.  
    
  The Senior Notes are unsecured and impose certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, pay distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into mergers.  We were in compliance with the restrictive covenants for the Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016  .  At any time when the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody s and Standard   Poor s and no default or event of default exists, we will not be subject to many of the foregoing covenants.  Additionally, we have certain redemption rights at varying premiums over face value under the Senior Notes. 
    
  Indebtedness under the Senior Notes is guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  
    
  Long-term Debt 
  The carrying amounts of our long-term debt are as follows:   

Interest Rate Risk Management 
  We use interest rate swaps (derivative instruments) to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have two interest rate swaps with identical terms that hedge our exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of LIBOR changes on   $150 million   of Credit Agreement advances. The swaps effectively convert   $150 million   of our LIBOR based debt to fixed rate debt having an interest rate of   0.74%   plus an applicable margin of   2.25%   as of   September 30, 2016  , which equaled an effective interest rate of   2.99%  .  Both of these swap contracts mature in July 2017.  
    
  We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.  Based on our assessment of effectiveness using the change in variable cash flows method, we have determined these interest rate swaps are effective in offsetting the variability in interest payments on   $150 million   of our variable rate debt resulting from changes in LIBOR.  Under hedge accounting, we adjust our cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis to their fair values with the offsetting fair value adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Also on a quarterly basis, we measure hedge effectiveness by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest to be paid or received on the variable leg of our swaps against the expected future interest payments on   $150 million   of our variable rate debt.  Any ineffectiveness is recorded directly to interest expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no ineffectiveness on our cash flow hedges. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we have accumulated other comprehensive loss of   $0.1 million   that relates to our current cash flow hedging instruments.  Approximately   $0.1 million   will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense as interest is paid on the underlying swap agreement over the next twelve-month period, assuming interest rates remain unchanged.

    Related Party Transactions 
       
  We serve HFC s refineries under long-term pipeline, terminal and tankage throughput agreements, and refinery processing unit tolling agreements expiring from 2019 to 2036.  Under these agreements, HFC agrees to transport, store and process throughput volumes of refined product, crude oil and feedstocks on our pipelines, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to us.  These minimum annual payments or revenues are subject to annual rate adjustments on July 1st each year based on the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) index.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these agreements with HFC require minimum annualized payments to us of   $321.1 million  . 
    
  If HFC fails to meet its minimum volume commitments under the agreements in any quarter, it will be required to pay us the amount of any shortfall in cash by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter.  Under certain of these agreements, a shortfall payment may be applied as a credit in the following four quarters after its minimum obligations are met. 
    
  Under certain provisions of an omnibus agreement we have with HFC (the  Omnibus Agreement ), we pay HFC an annual administrative fee (currently   $2.5 million  ) for the provision by HFC or its affiliates of various general and administrative services to us.  This fee does not include the salaries of personnel employed by HFC who perform services for us on behalf of HLS or the cost of their employee benefits, which are charged to us separately by HFC.  Also, we reimburse HFC and its affiliates for direct expenses they incur on our behalf. 
    
  Related party transactions with HFC are as follows:

shortfall billings.  It is possible that HFC may not exceed its minimum obligations to receive credit for any of the   $4.6 million   deferred at   September 30, 2016  . 
             
    On February 22, 2016, HFC obtained a   50%   membership interest in Osage in a non-monetary exchange, whereby a subsidiary of Magellan will provide terminalling services for all HFC products originating in Artesia, New Mexico that require terminalling in or through El Paso, Texas. Concurrent with this transaction, we entered into a non-monetary exchange with HFC, whereby we received HFC s interest in Osage in exchange for our El Paso terminal. See Note 1 for a description of this transaction.  
                
    On March 31, 2016, we acquired crude oil tanks located at HFC s Tulsa refinery from an affiliate of Plains for   $39.5 million  .  See Note 1 for a description of this transaction.  
                
    Effective October 1, 2016, we acquired all the membership interests of  Woods Cross Operating LLC ( Woods Cross Operating ), a wholly owned subsidiary of HFC, which owns the newly constructed atmospheric distillation tower, fluid catalytic cracking unit, and polymerization unit located at HFC s Woods Cross Refinery, for cash consideration of    $278 million  .  See Note 1 for a description of this transaction. 

Note 9: 
     Partners  Equity 
       
  As of    September 30, 2016  , HFC held   22,380,030   of our common units and the   2%   general partner interest, which together constituted a   39%   ownership interest in us.  Additionally, HFC owned all incentive distribution rights in us. 
    
  Common Unit Private Placement 
  On September 16, 2016, we entered into a common unit purchase agreement in which certain purchasers agreed to purchase in a private placement   3,420,000   common units representing limited partnership interests, at a price of   $30.18   per common unit. 
  The private placement closed on October 3, 2016, and we received proceeds of approximately   $103 million  , which were used to finance a portion of the Woods Cross acquisition discussed below. The purchase agreement is classified as an equity transaction, and as a result, no amounts are recorded in the consolidated financial statements until settlement. As a result of the private placement, HFC now owns a   37%   interest in us (including the 2% general partner interest).  To maintain the 2% general partner interest, HFC contributed   $2.1 million   in October 2016.  
    
  Continuous Offering Program 
  On May 10, 2016, we established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of   $200 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP has issued   703,455   units under this program, providing   $23.5 million   in gross proceeds.  We incurred sales commissions of   $0.5 million   associated with the issuance of these units. In connection with this program and to maintain the   2%   general partner interest, HFC made capital contributions totaling   $0.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  We intend to use our net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Amounts repaid under our credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time. 
    
  Allocations of Net Income 
  Net income attributable to HEP is allocated between limited partners and the general partner interest in accordance with the provisions of the partnership agreement.  HEP net income allocated to the general partner includes incentive distributions that are declared subsequent to quarter end.  After the amount of incentive distributions is allocated to the general partner, the remaining net income attributable to HEP is allocated to the partners based on their weighted-average ownership percentage during the period.

  (Unaudited) Continued 

The following table presents the allocation of the general partner interest in net income for the periods presented below:    

Cash Distributions 
  Our general partner, HEP Logistics, is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds specified target levels. 
    
  On   October 21, 2016  , we announced our cash distribution for the   third   quarter of   2016   of   $0.595   per unit.  The distribution is payable on all common and general partner units and will be paid   November 10, 2016  , to all unitholders of record on   October 31, 2016  . 
    
  The following table presents the allocation of our regular quarterly cash distributions to the general and limited partners for the periods in which they apply.  Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end; therefore, the amounts presented do not reflect distributions paid during the periods presented below. 

As a master limited partnership, we distribute our available cash, which historically has exceeded our net income attributable to HEP because depreciation and amortization expense represents a non-cash charge against income.  The result is a decline in our partners  equity since our regular quarterly distributions have exceeded our quarterly net income attributable to HEP.  Additionally, if the asset contributions and acquisitions from HFC had occurred while we were not a consolidated variable interest entity of HFC, our acquisition cost in excess of HFC s historical basis in the transferred assets would have been recorded in our financial statements at the time of acquisition as increases to our properties and equipment and intangible assets instead of decreases to our partners  equity. 

Note 10: 
     Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit 
       
  Net income per unit applicable to the limited partners is computed using the two-class method, because we have more than one class of participating securities.  The classes of participating securities as of   September 30, 2016  , included common units, general partner units and incentive distribution rights (IDRs). To the extent net income attributable to the partnership exceeds or is less than cash distributions, this difference is allocated based on the unitholders  respective ownership percentages, after consideration of any priority allocations of earnings.   
    
  When our financial statements are retrospectively adjusted after a dropdown transaction, the earnings of the acquired business or asset, prior to the closing of the transaction, are allocated entirely to our general partner and presented as net income (loss) attributable to predecessors as shown below.  The earnings per unit of our limited partners prior to the close of the transaction do

not change as a result of the dropdown.  After the closing of a dropdown transaction, the earnings of the acquired business are allocated in accordance with our partnership agreement as previously described.  
    
  For purposes of applying the two-class method including the allocation of cash distributions in excess of earnings, net income per limited partner unit is computed as follows:

We incurred   no   environmental remediation expense for long term environmental remediation projects for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $0.2 million   for environmental expense for  long term environmental remediation projects, and we incurred   $4.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,   2015. The accrued environmental liability,  net of expected recoveries from indemnifying parties,  reflected in our consolidated balance sheets was   $7.0 million   and   $7.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which   $5.4 million   and   $6.1 million  , respectively, were classified as other long-term liabilities.  These accruals include remediation and monitoring costs expected to be incurred over an extended period of time. 
    
  Under the Omnibus Agreement and certain transportation agreements and purchase agreements with HFC, HFC has agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain monetary and time limitations, for environmental noncompliance and remediation liabilities associated with certain assets transferred to us from HFC and occurring or existing prior to the date of such transfers.  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , our consolidated balance sheets  included additional accrued environmental liabilities of   $1.0 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively, for HFC indemnified liabilities, and other assets included equal and offsetting balances representing amounts due from HFC related to indemnifications for environmental remediation liabilities. 

We are a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings, none of which we believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.

           Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  This Item 2, including but not limited to the sections under  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  contains forward-looking statements.  See  Forward-Looking Statements  at the beginning of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In this document, the words  we,   our,   ours  and  us  refer to Holly Energy Partners, L. P. ( HEP ) and its consolidated subsidiaries or to HEP or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  HEP is a Delaware limited partnership. We own and operate petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminal, tankage and loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that support the refining and marketing operations of HollyFrontier Corporation ( HFC ) in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and Alon USA, Inc s ( Alon ) refinery in Big Spring, Texas.  HEP, through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, owns and/or operates petroleum product and crude gathering pipelines, tankage and terminals in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Washington, Idaho, Oklahoma, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming and Kansas as well as refinery processing units in Kansas.  HFC owned a   39%   interest in us, including the   2%   general partnership interest, as of September 30, 2016.  
    
  We generate revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through our pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling and storing refined products and other hydrocarbons, providing other services at our storage tanks and terminals and charging a tolling fee per barrel or thousand standard cubic feet of feedstock throughput in our refinery processing units.  We do not take ownership of products that we transport, terminal or store, and therefore, we are not directly exposed  to changes in commodity prices. 
    
  On September 16, 2016, we entered into a common unit purchase agreement in which certain purchasers agreed to purchase in a private placement   3,420,000   common units representing limited partnership interests, at a price of   $30.18   per common unit. The private placement closed on October 3, 2016, and we received proceeds of approximately   $103 million  , which were used to finance a portion of the Woods Cross acquisition discussed below. As a result of the private placement, HFC now owns a   37%   interest in us (including the 2% general partner interest).  To maintain the 2% general partner interest, HFC contributed   $2.1 million   to HEP in October 2016.  
    
  On July 19, 2016, we closed a private placement of   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior unsecured notes due in 2024.  We used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement. 
    
  On May 10, 2016, we established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of   $200 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP has issued   703,455   units under this program, providing   $23.5 million   in gross proceeds.  We incurred sales commissions of   $0.5 million   associated with the issuance of these units. We intend to use our net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Amounts repaid under our credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time. 
    
  We believe the long-term growth of global refined product demand and US crude production should support high utilization rates for the refineries we serve, which in turn will support volumes in our product pipelines, crude gathering system and terminals. 
    
  UNEV Pipeline Interest Acquisition 
  Under the terms of the transaction to acquire HFC s 75% interest in UNEV in 2012, we issued to HFC a Class B unit comprising a noncontrolling equity interest in a wholly-owned subsidiary subject to redemption to the extent that HFC is entitled to a 50% interest in our share of annual UNEV earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization above $30 million beginning July 1, 2015, and ending in June 2032, subject to certain limitations.  However, to the extent earnings thresholds are not achieved, no redemption payments are required.  No redemption payments have been required to date.   
    
  Contemporaneously with this transaction, HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P. ( HEP Logistics ) (our general partner) agreed to forego its right to incentive distributions of up to $1.25 million per quarter over twelve consecutive quarterly periods following the closing of the transaction and up to an additional four quarters if HFC s Woods Cross Refinery expansion did not attain certain thresholds.   HEP Logistics  waiver of its right to incentive distributions of $1.25 million per quarter ended with the distribution paid in the third quarter of 2016. In connection with the transaction, we entered into 15-year throughput agreements with shippers, which currently require minimum annual revenue commitments to us of $29.3 million.

Acquisitions 
  Effective October 1, 2016, we acquired all the membership interests of  Woods Cross Operating LLC ( Woods Cross Operating ), a wholly owned subsidiary of HFC, which owns the newly constructed atmospheric distillation tower, fluid catalytic cracking unit, and polymerization unit located at HFC s Woods Cross Refinery, for cash consideration of    $278 million  .  The consideration was funded with approximately   $103 million   in proceeds from the private placement of HEP common units and the balance with borrowings under our credit facility. In connection with this transaction, we entered into 15-year tolling agreements containing minimum quarterly throughput commitments from HFC that provide minimum annualized revenues of   $56.7 million  . 
    
  On June 3, 2016, we acquired a 50% interest in Cheyenne Pipeline LLC, owner of the Cheyenne Pipeline, in exchange for a contribution of $42.5 million in cash to Cheyenne Pipeline LLC.  Cheyenne Pipeline will continue to be operated by an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., which owns the remaining 50% interest.  The 87-mile crude oil pipeline runs from Fort Laramie to Cheyenne, Wyoming and has an 80,000 barrel per day capacity.  
    
  On March 31, 2016, we acquired crude oil tanks located at HFC s Tulsa refinery from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. for   $39.5 million  .  In connection with this transaction, we entered into a 10-year throughput agreement containing minimum quarterly throughput commitments from HFC that provide minimum annualized revenues of   $6.4 million  .   
    
  On February 22, 2016, HFC obtained a 50% membership interest in Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC ( Osage ) in a non-monetary exchange for a 20-year terminalling services agreement, whereby a subsidiary of Magellan Midstream Partners ( Magellan ) will provide terminalling services for all HFC products originating in Artesia, New Mexico that require terminalling in or through El Paso, Texas. Osage is the owner of the Osage Pipeline, a 135-mile pipeline that transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to HFC s El Dorado Refinery in Kansas and also has a connection to the Jayhawk pipeline that services the CHS Inc. refinery in McPherson, Kansas. The Osage Pipeline is the primary pipeline that supplies HFC s El Dorado Refinery with crude oil.  
    
  Concurrent with this transaction, we entered into a non-monetary exchange with HFC, whereby we received HFC s interest in Osage in exchange for our El Paso terminal. Under this exchange, we have also agreed to build two connections on our south products pipeline system that will permit HFC access to Magellan s El Paso terminal. Effective upon the closing of this exchange, we are the named operator of the Osage Pipeline and are working to transition into that role.  Since we are a consolidated variable interest entity of HFC, this transaction was recorded as a transfer between entities under common control and reflects HFC s carrying basis of its 50% membership interest in Osage of    $44.5 million   offset by our carrying basis in the El Paso terminal of   $12.1 million   with the difference treated as a contribution from HFC. 
    
  On November 1, 2015, we acquired from HollyFrontier El Dorado Refining LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of HFC, all the outstanding membership interests in El Dorado Operating LLC ( El Dorado Operating ), which owns the newly constructed naphtha fractionation and hydrogen generation units at HFC s El Dorado refinery for cash consideration of $62.0 million.  In connection with this transaction, we entered into 15-year tolling agreements containing minimum quarterly throughput commitments from HFC that provide minimum annualized revenues of   $15.2 million  .  We are a consolidated variable interest entity of HFC.  Therefore, this transaction was recorded as a transfer between entities under common control and reflected HFC s carrying basis in El Dorado Operating s assets and liabilities.  
    
  Agreements with HFC and Alon 
  We serve HFC s refineries under long-term pipeline, terminal and tankage throughput agreements and refinery processing unit tolling agreements expiring from 2019 to 2036. Under these agreements, HFC has agreed to transport, store and process throughput volumes of refined product, crude oil and feedstocks on our pipelines, terminal, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to us.  These minimum annual payments or revenues are subject to annual rate adjustments on July 1st each year, based on the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) index.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these agreements with HFC require minimum annualized payments to us of   $321.1 million  . 
    
  If HFC fails to meet its minimum volume commitments under the agreements in any quarter, it will be required to pay us the amount of any shortfall in cash by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter.  Under certain of the agreements, a shortfall payment may be applied as a credit in the following four quarters after minimum obligations are met. 
    
  We also have a pipelines and terminals agreement with Alon expiring in 2020 under which Alon has agreed to transport on our pipelines and throughput through our terminals volumes of refined products that result in a minimum level of annual revenue that  is also subject to annual tariff rate adjustments.  We also have a capacity lease agreement under which we lease Alon space on our Orla to El Paso pipeline for the shipment of refined product.  The terms under this agreement expire beginning in 2018 through 2022.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these agreements with Alon require minimum annualized payments to us of   $32.1 million  .

A significant reduction in revenues under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  Under certain provisions of an omnibus agreement we have with HFC ( Omnibus Agreement ), we pay HFC an annual administrative fee, currently $2.5 million, for the provision by HFC or its affiliates of various general and administrative services to us.  This fee does not include the salaries of personnel employed by HFC who perform services for us on behalf of Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. ( HLS ), or the cost of their employee benefits, which are separately charged to us by HFC.  We also reimburse HFC and its affiliates for direct expenses they incur on our behalf. 
    
  Under HLS s Secondment Agreement with HFC, certain employees of HFC are seconded to HLS to provide operational and maintenance services for certain of our processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets, and HLS reimburses HFC for its prorated portion of the wages, benefits, and other costs of these employees for our benefit. 
    
  We have a long-term strategic relationship with HFC. Our current growth plan is to continue to pursue purchases of logistic and other assets at HFC s existing refining locations in New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma, Kansas and Wyoming. We also expect to work with HFC on logistic asset acquisitions that support HFC s refinery acquisition strategies. Furthermore, we plan to continue to pursue third-party logistic asset acquisitions that are accretive to our unitholders and increase the diversity of our revenues.

(1) 
    Net income attributable to HEP is allocated between limited partners and the general partner interest in accordance with the provisions of the partnership agreement.  HEP net income allocated to the general partner includes incentive distributions that are declared subsequent to quarter end.  After the amount of incentive distributions is allocated to the general partner, the remaining net income attributable to HEP is allocated to the partners based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period. 
       
           (2) 
    Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) is calculated as net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners plus (i) interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of interest income, (ii) state income tax and (iii) depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA is not a calculation based upon generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  However, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements operations.  EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners or operating income, as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity.  EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  EBITDA is presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by investors and analysts to measure performance.  EBITDA is also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for compliance with financial covenants.  Set forth below is our calculation of EBITDA. 

(3) 
    Distributable cash flow is not a calculation based upon GAAP.  However, the amounts included in the calculation are derived from amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements, with the general exceptions of maintenance capital expenditures.  Distributable cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity.  Distributable cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Distributable cash flow is presented here because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare partnership performance.  It is also used by management for internal analysis and for our performance units.  We believe that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets and the cash our business is generating.  Set forth below is our calculation of distributable cash flow.

    Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives.  Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline integrity, safety and to address environmental regulations. 
       
           (5) 
    As a master limited partnership, we distribute our available cash, which historically has exceeded our net income attributable to HEP because depreciation and amortization expense represents a non-cash charge against income.  The result is a decline in partners  equity since our regular quarterly distributions have exceeded our quarterly net income attributable to HEP.  Additionally, if the assets contributed and acquired from HFC while we were a consolidated variable interest entity of HFC had been acquired from third parties, our acquisition cost in excess of HFC s basis in the transferred assets would have been recorded in our financial statements as increases to our properties and equipment and intangible assets at the time of acquisition instead of decreases to partners  equity. 

Results of Operations Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared with Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Summary 
  Net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners for the   third   quarter was   $34.8 million   (  $0.33   per basic and diluted limited partner unit) compared to   $34.3 million   (  $0.40   per basic and diluted limited partner unit) for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase in earnings is primarily due to recent acquisitions including interests in the Frontier, Osage, and Cheyenne pipelines, the Tulsa crude tanks acquired in the first quarter of 2016, and the El Dorado refinery process units dropped down in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as increased revenues from our 75% interest in the UNEV products pipeline offset by higher interest expense associated with our 6% Senior Notes, which we issued in July and the proceeds of which were eventually used to fund our Woods Cross processing units acquisition. 
  Our major shippers are obligated to make deficiency payments to us if they do not meet their minimum volume shipping obligations.  Revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , include the recognition of   $0.2 million   of prior shortfalls billed to shippers in   2015   compared to revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , which included the recognition of   $0.6 million   of prior shortfalls billed to shippers in 2014.  Additional shortfall billings of   $2.1 million   associated with certain guaranteed shipping contracts were deferred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Such deferred revenue will be recognized in earnings either as (a) payment for shipments in excess of guaranteed levels, if and to the extent the pipeline system will have the necessary capacity for shipments in excess of guaranteed levels, or (b) when shipping rights expire unused over the contractual make-up period. 
  Revenues 
  Revenues for the quarter were   $92.6 million  , an increase of   $4.2 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to revenues from the El Dorado processing units acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the inclusion of Tulsa crude tanks revenues. Overall pipeline volumes were down   5%   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , largely due to lower crude pipeline volumes.

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

Revenues from our refined product pipelines were   $30.4 million  , a decrease of   $0.6 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , mainly due to lower tariff rates.  Shipments averaged   201.5   mbpd compared to   197.8   mbpd for the   third   quarter of   2015   mainly due to increased throughput volumes on the UNEV pipeline. 
  Revenues from our intermediate pipelines were   $6.6 million  , a decrease of   $0.9 million  , on shipments averaging   142.4   mbpd compared to   148.8   mbpd for the   third   quarter of   2015   mainly due to lower volumes from pipelines servicing HFC s Navajo Refinery and a $0.4 million decrease in deferred revenue realized. 
  Revenues from our crude pipelines were   $17.0 million  , a decrease of   $0.4 million  , on shipments averaging   271.3   mbpd compared to   297.8   mbpd for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Revenues decreased mainly due to tariff decreases as we continued to recognize revenue on minimum volume commitments. 
    
  Revenues from terminal, tankage and loading rack fees were   $34.4 million  , an increase of   $1.9 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Refined products terminalled in the facilities averaged   505.8   mbpd compared to   509.7   mbpd for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The volume decrease  is mainly due to the transfer of the El Paso terminal to HFC offset by the inclusion of volumes from our Tulsa crude tanks acquired in the first quarter of 2016.   Revenues increased mainly due to revenue from the Tulsa crude tanks. 
    
  Operations Expense 
  Operations (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased by   $3.8 million   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase is mainly due to operating expenses from the newly acquired El Dorado processing units offset by lower maintenance project costs.  
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , decreased by   $0.9 million   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is principally due to accelerated tank depreciation and tank write-downs that occurred in the third quarter of 2015 offset by higher depreciation from our newly acquired El Dorado operating units. 
    
  General and Administrative 
  General and administrative costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , decreased by   $1.0 million   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   mainly due to lower incentive compensation. 
    
  Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investments 

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , totaled   $14.4 million  , an increase of   $5.0 million   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase is primarily due to the issuance of new 6% Senior Note in July. Our aggregate effective interest rates were   5.3%   and   4.1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  State Income Tax 
  We recorded state income tax expense of   $61,000   and   $69,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  All tax expense is solely attributable to the Texas margin tax.  

Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Summary 
  Net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $116.7 million   compared to   $96.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in earnings is primarily due to our share of earnings  
  
   -   39   - 

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

from our acquisitions of 50% interests in Frontier Aspen LLC, Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC, and Cheyenne Pipeline LLC, our Tulsa crude tanks acquired in the first quarter of 2016, our refinery processing units acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, and increased revenues from our 75% interest in the UNEV products pipeline. 
    
  Revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , include the recognition of   $7.2 million   of prior shortfalls billed to shippers in   2015   as they did not meet their minimum volume commitments within the contractual makeup period.  Deficiency payments of   $6.1 million   associated with certain guaranteed shipping contracts were deferred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Such deferred revenue will be recognized in earnings either as (a) payment for shipments in excess of guaranteed levels, if and to the extent the pipeline system will have the necessary capacity for shipments in excess of guaranteed levels, or (b) when shipping rights expire unused over the contractual make-up period. 
    
  Revenues 
  Revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   $289.5 million  , a   $27.9 million   increase compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This is due principally to increased revenues from the El Dorado processing units, increased UNEV pipeline revenues, increased revenues on our crude pipelines servicing HollyFrontier's Navajo refinery, and the inclusion of Tulsa crude tanks revenues  .   Overall pipeline volumes were down   1.2%    compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Revenues from our refined product pipelines were   $101.2 million  , an increase of   $4.4 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , mainly due to increased revenue from UNEV of $4.7 million in addition to increased volumes and annual tariff increases.  Shipments averaged   204.1   mbpd compared to   193.5   mbpd for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , largely due to increased volumes from pipelines servicing HFC s Navajo refinery and the UNEV pipeline. 
  Revenues from our intermediate pipelines were   $20.8 million  , a decrease of   $0.7 million  , on shipments averaging   138.3   mbpd compared to   143.4   mbpd for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in revenue was mainly due to lower volumes from pipelines servicing HFC's Navajo refinery and a $0.4 million decrease in deferred revenue realized. 
  Revenues from our crude pipelines were   $53.1 million  , an increase of   $3.6 million  , on shipments averaging   279.0   mbpd compared to   292.2   mbpd for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Revenues increased mainly due to an increase in deferred revenue recognized and to a surcharge on our Beeson expansion.  
    
  Revenues from terminal, tankage and loading rack fees were   $101.5 million  , an increase of   $7.7 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Revenues increased primarily due to increased revenue from the El Dorado and Tulsa crude tanks, and higher volumes through the UNEV terminals.  Refined products terminalled in the facilities averaged   478.0   mbpd compared to   466.2   mbpd for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The volume increase is mainly due to the inclusion of volumes from our Tulsa crude tanks acquired in the first quarter of 2016 and our El Dorado crude tanks acquired late in the first quarter of 2015 offset by the transfer of the El Paso terminal to HFC in the first quarter of 2016.  
    
  Operations Expense 
  Operations expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , increased by   $4.5 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase is primarily due to operating expenses for our El Dorado processing units acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 partially offset by lower environmental costs and maintenance project expenses. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , increased by   $1.4 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase is due principally to higher depreciation from our newly acquired El Dorado refinery processing units.   
    
  General and Administrative 
  General and administrative costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , decreased   $1.0 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   mainly due to lower incentive compensation.

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $36.3 million  , an increase of   $8.9 million   compared to the    nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase is primarily due to the $400 million 6% senior notes issued July 19, 2016, and a higher average balance outstanding on the Credit Agreement.  Our aggregate effective interest rates were   4.6%   and   4.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.

  We recorded state income tax expense of   $210,000   and   $106,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. All tax expense is solely attributable to the Texas margin tax.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
    
  Overview 
  In March 2016, we amended our  senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) expiring in November 2018, increasing the size of the Credit Agreement from   $850 million   to   $1.2 billion  , which is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes.  It is also available to fund letters of credit up to a   $50 million   sub-limit.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received advances totaling   $310.5 million   and repaid   $642.5 million  , resulting in a net decrease of   $332.0 million   under the Credit Agreement and an outstanding balance of   $380.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  We have no letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016  , and the available capacity under the Credit Agreement is   $820.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  If any particular lender under the Credit Agreement could not honor its commitment, we believe the unused capacity that would be available from the remaining lenders would be sufficient to meet our borrowing needs.  Additionally, we review publicly available information on the lenders in order to monitor their financial stability and assess their ongoing ability to honor their commitments under the Credit Agreement.  We do not expect to experience any difficulty in the lenders  ability to honor their respective commitments, and if it were to become necessary, we believe there would be alternative lenders or options available.  
    
  On September 16, 2016, we entered into a common unit purchase agreement in which certain purchasers agreed to purchase in a private placement   3,420,000   common units representing limited partnership interests, at a price of   $30.18   per common unit. The private placement closed on October 3, 2016, and we received proceeds of approximately   $103 million  , which were used to finance a portion of the Wood Cross acquisition discussed below. As a result of the private placement, HFC now owns a   37%   interest in us (including the 2% general partner interest).  To maintain the 2% general partner interest, HFC contributed   $2.1 million   to HEP in October 2016.  
    
  On July 19, 2016, we closed a private placement of   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.0%   senior unsecured notes due in 2024.  We used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement.  
    
  On May 10, 2016, we established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of   $200 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP has issued   703,455   units under this program, providing approximately   $23.5 million   in gross proceeds. We incurred sales commissions of   $0.5 million   associated with the issuance of these units. We intend to use the net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Amounts repaid under our credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time.

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

Under our registration statement filed with the SEC using a  shelf  registration process, we currently have the authority to raise up to   $2.0 billion  , less amounts issued under the $200 million continuous offering program, by offering securities, through one or more prospectus supplements that would describe, among other things, the specific amounts, prices and terms of any securities offered and how the proceeds would be used.  Any proceeds from the sale of securities would be used for general business purposes, which may include, among other things, funding acquisitions of assets or businesses, working capital, capital expenditures, investments in subsidiaries, the retirement of existing debt and/or the repurchase of common units or other securities. 
    
  We believe our current cash balances, future internally generated funds and funds available under the Credit Agreement will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.   
    
  In February, May, and August 2016, we paid regular quarterly cash distributions of   $0.565  ,   $0.575  , and   $0.585   on all units in an aggregate amount of   $138.8 million   including   $34.5 million   of incentive distribution payments to our general partner. 
    
  Contemporaneously with our UNEV interest acquisition on July 12, 2012, HEP Logistics, our general partner, agreed to forego its right to incentive distributions of $1.25 million per quarter over twelve consecutive quarterly periods following the close of the transaction and up to an additional four quarters if HFC s Woods Cross Refinery expansion did not attain certain thresholds.  HEP Logistics  waiver of its right to incentive distributions of $1.25 million per quarter ended with the distribution paid in the third quarter of 2016.   
    
  Cash and cash equivalents decreased by   $7.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The cash flows provided by operating activities of   $185.0 million   were less than the cash flows used for financing activities of   $103.6 million   and investing activities of   $89.2 million  .  Working capital decreased by   $11.3 million   to   $0.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $12.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Cash Flows Operating Activities 
  Cash flows from operating activities increased by   $19.4 million   from   $165.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   $185.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This increase is due principally to higher cash receipts for services performed and higher distributions received from equity investments partially offset by higher payments for interest and operating expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior year. 
    
  Cash Flows Investing Activities 
  Cash flows used for investing activities were   $89.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $136.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $47.3 million  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we invested   $48.2 million   and   $55.8 million   in additions to properties and equipment, respectively.  We purchased a 50% interest in Cheyenne Pipeline LLC for   $42.6 million   in June 2016, and the El Dorado crude tank assets for   $27.5 million   in March 2015 and a 50% interest in Frontier Pipeline for   $54.6 million   in August 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows Financing Activities 
  Cash flows used for financing activities were   $103.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $21.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $82.6 million  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received   $310.5 million   and repaid   $642.5 million   in advances under the Credit Agreement.  We also received net proceeds of   $394 million   from the issuance of our 6% senior notes and   $22.8 million   from issuance of common units under our continuous offering program.  Additionally, we paid   $138.8 million   in regular quarterly cash distributions to our general and limited partners,   $3.8 million   to our noncontrolling interest and   $0.8 million   for the purchase of common units for recipients of our incentive grants.  We paid   $39.5 million   for the crude oil tanks located at HFC s Tulsa refinery acquired in March 2016, and    $1.2 million   to HFC related to the Osage acquisition. We also paid   $3.9 million   in deferred financing charges to amend our credit agreement.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we received   $443.0 million   and repaid   $360.0 million   in advances under the Credit Agreement.  We paid    $125.2 million   in regular quarterly cash distributions to our general and limited partners, distributed   $2.9 million   to our noncontrolling interest, and paid   $0.2 million   for the purchase of common units for recipients of our incentive grants. In addition, we received   $24.4 million   for the El Dorado Operating acquisition and   $0.8 million   for Tulsa tank expenditures from HFC. 
    
  Capital Requirements 
  Our pipeline and terminalling operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations.  Our capital requirements have consisted of, and are expected to continue to consist of, maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures.   Maintenance capital expenditures  represent capital expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of existing assets.  Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline integrity, safety and to address environmental regulations.   Expansion capital expenditures  represent capital expenditures  
  
   -   42   - 

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

to expand the operating capacity of existing or new assets, whether through construction or acquisition.  Expansion capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets, to grow our business and to expand existing facilities, such as projects that increase throughput capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals.  Repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred.  
    
  Each year the board of directors of HLS, our ultimate general partner, approves our annual capital budget, which specifies capital projects that our management is authorized to undertake.  Additionally, at times when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, additional projects may be approved.  The funds allocated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period in excess of a year, depending on the time required to complete the project.  Therefore, our planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures approved for capital projects included in the current year s capital budget as well as, in certain cases, expenditures approved for capital projects in capital budgets for prior years.  The 2016 capital budget is comprised of $13 million for maintenance capital expenditures and $57 million for expansion capital expenditures.  We expect to spend approximately $60 million to $65 million of total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, for the year.  We expect the majority of the expansion capital budget to be invested in refined product pipeline expansions, crude system enhancements, new storage tanks, and enhanced blending capabilities at our racks.  In addition to our capital budget, we may spend funds periodically to perform capital upgrades or additions to our assets where a customer reimburses us for such costs.  The upgrades or additions would generally benefit the customer over the remaining life of the related service agreements. 
  We expect that our currently planned sustaining and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for acquisitions and capital development projects, will be funded with cash generated by operations, the sale of additional limited partner common units, the issuance of debt securities and advances under our Credit Agreement, or a combination thereof. With volatility and uncertainty at times in the credit and equity markets, there may be limits on our ability to issue new debt or equity financing. Additionally, due to pricing movements in the debt and equity markets, we may not be able to issue new debt and equity securities at acceptable pricing. Without additional capital beyond amounts available under the Credit Agreement, our ability to obtain funds for some of these capital projects may be limited. 
    
  Under the terms of the transaction to acquire HFC s 75% interest in UNEV, we issued to HFC a Class B unit comprising a noncontrolling equity interest in a wholly-owned subsidiary subject to redemption to the extent that HFC is entitled to a 50% interest in our share of annual UNEV earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization above $30 million beginning July 1, 2015, and ending in June 2032, subject to certain limitations. 
    
  Credit Agreement 
  In March 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement increasing the size of the Credit Agreement from $850 million to $1.2 billion.  The Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital as well as for general partnership purposes.  It is also available to fund letters of credit up to a   $50 million   sub-limit.  
    
  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.  Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement involves recourse to HEP Logistics, our general partner, and is guaranteed by our material wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Any recourse to HEP Logistics would be limited to the extent of its assets, which other than its investment in us, are not significant.  We may prepay all loans at any time without penalty, except for payment of certain breakage and related costs. 
    
  The Credit Agreement imposes certain requirements on us with which we were in compliance with as of   September 30, 2016  , including: a prohibition against distribution to unitholders if, before or after the distribution, a potential default or an event of default as defined in the agreement would occur; limitations on our ability to incur debt, make loans, acquire other companies, change the nature of our business, enter into a merger or consolidation, or sell assets; and covenants that require maintenance of a specified EBITDA to interest expense ratio, total debt to EBITDA ratio and senior debt to EBITDA ratio.  If an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, the lenders will be able to accelerate the maturity of the debt and exercise other rights and remedies. 
    
  Senior Notes 
  We have   $300 million   in aggregate principal amount outstanding of   6.5%   senior notes (the  6.5% Senior Notes ) maturing March 2020.   
    
  On July 19, 2016, we closed a private placement of   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6%   senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the  6% Senior Notes  and together with the 6.5 % Senior Notes, the  Senior Notes ).  We used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement.  
    
  The Senior Notes are unsecured and impose certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, pay distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter  
  
   -   43   - 

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

into mergers.  We were in compliance with the restrictive covenants for the Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016  .  At any time when the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody s and Standard   Poor s and no default or event of default exists, we will not be subject to many of the foregoing covenants.  Additionally, we have certain redemption rights at varying premiums over face value under the Senior Notes. 
    
  Indebtedness under the Senior Notes is guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  
    
  Long-term Debt 
  The carrying amounts of our long-term debt are as follows:   

See  Risk Management  for a discussion of our interest rate swaps. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  There were no significant changes to our long-term contractual obligations during this period. 
    
  Impact of Inflation 
  Inflation in the United States has been relatively moderate in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Historically, the PPI has increased an average of 1.6% annually over the past five calendar years, including a decrease of 3.2% in 2015. 
    
  The substantial majority of our revenues are generated under long-term contracts that provide for increases or decreases in our rates and minimum revenue guarantees annually for increases or decreases in the PPI.  Certain of these contracts have provisions that limit the level of annual PPI percentage rate increases or decreases.  A significant and prolonged period of high inflation or a significant and prolonged period of negative inflation could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations if costs increase at a rate greater than the fees we charge our shippers. 
    
  Environmental Matters  
  Our operation of pipelines, terminals, and associated facilities in connection with the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil is subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  As with the industry generally, compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, and upgrade equipment and facilities.  While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe that they do not affect our competitive position given that the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.  However, these laws and regulations, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities, and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations.  Violation of environmental laws, regulations, and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, and construction bans or delays.  A major discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by employees, neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage.

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

Under the Omnibus Agreement and certain transportation agreements and purchase agreements with HFC, HFC has agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain monetary and time limitations, for environmental noncompliance and remediation liabilities associated with certain assets transferred to us from HFC and occurring or existing prior to the date of such transfers.  
  We have an environmental agreement with Alon with respect to pre-closing environmental costs and liabilities relating to the pipelines and terminals acquired from Alon in 2005, under which Alon will indemnify us subject to certain monetary and time limitations. 
    
  There are environmental remediation projects in progress that relate to certain assets acquired from HFC.  Certain of these projects were underway prior to our purchase and represent liabilities retained by HFC.  At   September 30, 2016  , we have a net accrual of   $7.0 million   that relates to environmental clean-up projects for which we have assumed liability or for which the indemnity provided for by HFC has expired or will expire.  The remaining projects, including assessment and monitoring activities, are covered under the HFC environmental indemnification discussed above and represent liabilities of HFC. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our significant accounting policies are described in  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations Critical Accounting Policies  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Certain critical accounting policies that materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, assessing the possible impairment of certain long-lived assets and goodwill, and assessing contingent liabilities for probable losses.  There have been no changes to these policies in   2016  .  We consider these policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, an accounting standard update was issued requiring revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration for these goods or services.  This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2018. We are evaluating the impact of this standard. 
    
  Consolidation 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued a standard that modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are 
  required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2016.  This standard had no impact on the entities we consolidate. 
    
  Financial Assets and Liabilities 
  In January 2016, an accounting standard update was issued requiring changes in the accounting and disclosures for financial instruments. This standard will become effective beginning with our 2018 reporting year. We are evaluating the impact of this standard. 
    
  Leases 
  In February 2016, an accounting standard update was issued requiring leases to be measured and recognized as a lease liability, with a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2019, and we are evaluating the impact of this standard. 
    
  Earnings Per Unit 
  In April 2015, an accounting standard update was issued requiring changes to the allocation of the earnings or losses of a transferred business for periods before the date of a dropdown of net assets accounted for as a common control transaction entirely to the general partner for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit.  We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016, as required.  In connection with the dropdown of assets from HFC s Tulsa refinery on March 31, 2016, we reduced net income by $0.2 million for the three months ending March 31, 2015.  This reduction had no impact on the historical earnings per unit. 

-   45   - 

     Table of Contents   ril 19,  

Share-Based Compensation 
  In March 2016, Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  was issued which simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective January 1, 2017, and will have an immaterial impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
    
  We use interest rate swaps (derivative instruments) to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have two interest rate swaps with identical terms that hedge our exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of LIBOR changes on   $150.0 million   of Credit Agreement advances.  The swaps effectively convert   $150.0 million   of our LIBOR based debt to fixed rate debt having an interest rate of   0.74%   plus an applicable margin of   2.25%   as of   September 30, 2016  , which equaled an effective interest rate of   2.99%  .  Both of these swap contracts mature in July 2017. 
    
  We review publicly available information on our counterparties in order to monitor their financial stability and assess their ongoing ability to honor their commitments under the interest rate swap contracts.  These counterparties are large financial institutions.  Furthermore, we have not experienced, nor do we expect to experience, any difficulty in the counterparties honoring their respective commitments. 
    
  The market risk inherent in our debt positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding principal balances of $300 million on our 6.5% Senior Notes and $400 million on our 6% Senior Notes.  A change in interest rates generally would affect the fair value of the Senior Notes, but not our earnings or cash flows.  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of our 6.5% Senior Notes was   $308.3 million   and of our 6% Senior Notes was   $412.0 million  .  We estimate a hypothetical 10% change in the yield-to-maturity applicable to the Senior Notes at   September 30, 2016  , would result in changes of approximately   $5.5 million   in the fair value of the underlying 6.5% Senior Notes, and   $14.1 million   in the fair value of the underlying 6% Senior Notes. 
    
  For the variable rate Credit Agreement, changes in interest rates would affect cash flows, but not the fair value.  At   September 30, 2016  , borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement were   $380.0 million  .  By means of our cash flow hedges, we have effectively converted the variable rate on   $150.0 million   of outstanding borrowings to a fixed rate.  For the remaining unhedged Credit Agreement borrowings of   $230.0 million  , a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates applicable to the Credit Agreement would not materially affect our cash flows.  
    
  Our operations are subject to normal hazards of operations, including fire, explosion and weather-related perils.  We maintain various insurance coverages, including business interruption insurance, subject to certain deductibles.  We are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable, coverage is unavailable, or premium costs, in our judgment, do not justify such expenditures. 
    
  We have a risk management oversight committee that is made up of members from our senior management.  This committee monitors our risk environment and provides direction for activities to mitigate, to an acceptable level, identified risks that may adversely affect the achievement of our goals. 

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. See  Risk Management  under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  for a discussion of market risk exposures that we have with respect to our long-term debt, which disclosure should be read in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015  .  We utilize derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure, as discussed under  Risk Management.  
    
  Since we do not own products shipped on our pipelines or terminalled at our terminal facilities, we do not have direct market risks associated with commodity prices.

    Controls and Procedures 
       
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
  Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , at a reasonable level of assurance. 
    
  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

  CERTIFICATION 
  I, George J. Damiris, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Holly Energy Partners, L.P; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function): 
              a. 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
