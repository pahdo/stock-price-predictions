  Back to Table of Contents     
	  Note 1. The Company  
	  Organizational Background:   
	 Emerald Medical Applications Corp. ( the
	Company ) (f/k/a Zaxis International Inc.) was incorporated in Ohio in 1989,
	it's fiscal year end is December 31st. On August 25, 1995, The Company
	merged with a subsidiary of The InFerGene Company ( InFerGene ) and
	InFerGene changed its name to The Company International Inc. InFerGene was
	incorporated in California in 1984 and subsequently changed its domicile in
	connection with the merger into The Company to Delaware in 1985. Operations
	ceased operations in 2002. In November 2002, the Company and its
	subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
	Northern District of Ohio. On October 13, 2004, the Company emerged from
	bankruptcy. 
	 On July 14, 2015 the closing of the Share
	Exchange Agreement was held (the  Closing ) and as a result, Emerald Medical
	Applications Ltd. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant.
	Pursuant to the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued
	5,474,545 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 (the  Shares  or
	 Common Stock ) to Lior Wayn, Emerald's CEO and the sole holder of Emerald
	Medical Applications Ltd.'s ordinary Shares, representing 40.58% of the
	company's 13,489,905 outstanding Shares, in exchange for 100% of Emerald
	Medical Applications Ltd.'s ordinary Shares. 
	 Subsequently to the Closing Mr. Lior Wayn has
	been appointed as the Company's CEO, and has been granted considerable
	influence on the appointment of new directors thereby creating a new
	management structure for the company replacing the old management.
	Additionally Mr. Wayn is to receive additional shares in the future
	contingent on the Company achieving commercial milestone. Thus the new
	management, headed by Mr. Wayn, is considered to be in control of more than
	50% of the company and with the ability to make all management decisions. 
	 Emerald is a company organized under the laws of
	the State of Israel on February 17, 2010. Emerald is digital health Startup
	Company engaged in the development, sale and service of imaging solutions
	utilizing its proprietary DermaCompare software that it developed for use in
	derma imaging and analytics ( DermaCompare ). Emerald believes that its
	proprietary DermaCompare software represents an advancement in skin cancer
	screening that should enable physicians to more readily identify and monitor
	changes in their patients' skin characteristics. 
	 Emerald's DermaCompare solution allows
	dermatologists and other medical care professionals, using a set of 25 total
	body photography ( TBP ), to capture sets of skin lesion images with, among
	other devices, digital cameras, camera-equipped smartphones or tablets.
	These images are then transmitted online and are remotely analyzed by
	professionals using our DermaCompare software. 
	 Emerald's sales and marketing plan is to sell
	licenses for our imaging software to: NHSs, HMOs, health insurance
	companies, hospitals and medical clinics through distributers, health care
	channel partners or directly through independent salespersons and/or web
	purchase to dermatologists and other physicians (GPs) that we expect to
	purchase licenses based on the number of potential numbers of patients. 
	  Basis of Presentation  
	 The accompanying financial statements have been
	prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
	going concern. The Company has not established any source of revenue to
	cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred operating losses since
	inception. Further, as of September 30, 2016, the cash resources of the
	Company were insufficient to meet its current business plan, and the Company
	had negative working capital. These and other factors raise substantial
	doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
	assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
	the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 
	 The Company elected December 31 as its fiscal
	year end. 
	   Significant Accounting Policies   
	  Use of Estimates  
	 The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
	of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates. 
	  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
	 For financial statement presentation purposes,
	the Company considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with
	original maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
	There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
	2015. 
	  Other Receivables  
	 The company treats VAT refunds claimed resulting
	from excess VAT paid over VAT received as other receivables, amount shown as
	other receivables as of September 30, 2016 was $ 4,852.  
	  Currency Translation and other Comprehensive
	Income  
	 Balance sheet items are translated using all
	current translation method for self-contained foreign operations (where
	functional currency = foreign currency) whereby assets and liabilities are
	translated using the exchange rate on the date of the balance sheet. It
	translates revenues, expenses, and net income using the average exchange
	rate during the period. The foreign exchange adjustment that results from
	applying the all-current method appears in other comprehensive income, a
	separate shareholders' equity account, and does not affect net income each
	period. 
	  Property and Equipment  
	 New property and equipment are recorded at cost.
	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets, generally 5 years. Expenditures for renewals and
	betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for minor items, repairs and
	maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Gain or loss upon sale or
	retirement due to obsolescence is reflected in the operating results in the
	period the event takes place. 
	  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets  
	 We review the recoverability of our long-lived
	assets including equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, when
	events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying
	value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible
	impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the
	asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
	interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less
	than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for
	the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Our primary
	measure of fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The measurement of
	impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related
	to long-lived assets, as well as other fair value determinations. 
	  Stock-Based Compensation  
	 Stock-based awards are accounted for using the
	fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, Share-Based Payments. Our
	primary type of share-based compensation consists of stock options. We use
	the Black-Scholes option pricing model in valuing options. The inputs for
	the valuation analysis of the options include the market value of the
	Company's common stock, the estimated volatility of the Company's common
	stock, the exercise price of the warrants and the risk free interest rate. 
	  Accounting For Obligations And Instruments
	Potentially To Be Settled In The Company's Own Stock  
	 We account for obligations and instruments
	potentially to be settled in the Company's stock in accordance with FASB ASC
	815, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments. This issue addresses
	the initial balance sheet classification and measurement of contracts that
	are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the Company's own stock. 
	  Accounting For Convertible Debt Instruments  
	 We account for convertible debt instruments,
	which do not meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument per
	FASB ASC 815, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments, in accordance
	with FASB ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. This issue
	addresses the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt
	into its equity and debt components. Discount on the debt component
	resulting from allocation of proceeds to the equity component is amortized
	in the profit and loss statement as finance expense. 
	  Fair Value Measurements  
	 The Company adopted the FASB standard related to
	fair value measurement at inception. The standard defines fair value,
	establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of
	fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting
	pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and,
	accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard
	clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that
	would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
	orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a
	market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that
	market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
	 As a basis for considering such assumptions, the
	standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes
	the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows. 
	 Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices
	in active markets; Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active
	markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3.
	Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which
	require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
	 The Company values its derivative instruments
	related to embedded conversion features and warrants from the issuance of
	convertible debentures in accordance with the Level 3 guidelines. For the
	nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the twelve-month period
	ending December 31, 2015, the following table reconciles the beginning and
	ending balances for financial instruments that are recognized at fair value
	in these consolidated financial statements. The fair value of embedded
	conversion features that have floating conversion features and tainted
	common stock equivalents (warrants and convertible debt) are estimated using
	a Binomial Lattice model. The key inputs to this valuation model as of
	December 31, 2015, were: Volatility of 143.9% for the nine-month period
	ended September 30, 2016 and 132.4% for the twelve-month period ending
	December 31, 2015, inherent term of instruments equal to the remaining
	contractual term, quoted closing stock prices on valuation dates, and
	various settlement scenarios and probability percentages summing to 100%.

Fair
Value Measurements at December 31, 2015  

Changes in the unobservable input values would likely cause material changes
	in the fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial instruments. The
	significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement is the
	estimation for probability percentages assigned to future expected
	settlement possibilities. A significant increase (decrease) in this
	distribution of percentages would result in a higher (lower) fair value
	measurement. 
	 
	The following schedule summarizes the valuation of
	financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance
	sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The fair values of our debts are deemed to approximate book value, and
	are considered Level 2 inputs as defined by ASC Topic 820-10-35. 
	 There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level
	1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
	or the year ended December 31, 2015. 
	 The Company had no other assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a
	recurring or non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 or December 31,
	2015. 
	  Earnings per Common Share  
	 We compute net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC
	260, Earning per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and
	diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic
	EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
	shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
	outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all
	dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
	treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted
	method. In computing, Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is
	used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
	exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive
	potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. All per share disclosures
	retroactively reflect shares outstanding or issuable as though the reverse
	split had occurred January 1, 2012. 
	  Income Taxes  
	 We have adopted FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Pursuant to
	ASC 740, we are required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating
	losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have
	not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot
	be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating
	losses carried forward in future years. 
	 We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax
	expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments
	occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise
	from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax
	and financial statement purposes. 
	 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
	differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and
	liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are
	expected to reverse. ASC 740 provides for the recognition of deferred tax
	assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur.
	Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating
	sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions
	to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net
	operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards. We have determined it more likely
	than not that these timing differences will not materialize and have
	provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred
	tax asset. Management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the
	deferred tax asset and its related valuation allowance. If our assessment of
	the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to
	change, we would record the related adjustment to income during the period
	in which we make the determination. Our tax rate may also vary based on our
	results and the mix of income or loss in domestic and foreign tax
	jurisdictions in which we operate. 
	 In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
	uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize
	liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
	jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which,
	additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of
	these amounts is unnecessary, we will reverse the liability and recognize a
	tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no
	longer necessary. We will record an additional charge in our provision for
	taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is
	less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 
	 ASC 740 which requires recognition of estimated income taxes payable or
	refundable on income tax returns for the current period and for the
	estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences and
	carry-forwards. Measurement of deferred income tax is based on enacted tax
	laws including tax rates, with the measurement of deferred income tax assets
	being reduced by available tax benefits not expected to be realized. 
	  Uncertain Tax Positions  
	 When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions
	taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while
	others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or
	the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance
	with the guidance of FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax
	Positions, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial
	statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence,
	management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
	sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or
	litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
	aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the
	more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest
	amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized
	upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the
	benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount
	measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for
	unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
	along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to
	the taxing authorities upon examination. 
	 Our federal and state income tax returns are open for fiscal years ending
	on or after December 31, 2011. We are not under examination by any
	jurisdiction for any tax year. At September 30, 2016, we had no material
	unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities or operations
	were required under FIN 48. 
	  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
	 In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business
	Combinations (Topic 805) ( ASU 2015-16 ). Topic 805 requires that an
	acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business
	combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for
	adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update
	require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that
	are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in
	which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also
	record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of
	changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a
	result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the
	accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity
	is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or
	disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount
	recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been
	recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional
	amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is
	effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU
	2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
	consolidated financial statements. 
	 In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ).
	The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for
	all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit
	entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in
	ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017,
	including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier
	application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after
	December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting
	period. 
	 In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued
	Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of
	Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which changes the presentation
	of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an
	entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from
	the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the
	costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for
	annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption
	is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior
	period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the
	impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets. 
	  Going Concern  
	 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
	The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating
	costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further,
	as of September 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were
	insufficient to meet its current business plan, and the Company had negative
	working capital. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the
	Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
	statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
	effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
	and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible
	inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

	since pursuant to the loan agreement the in the event that prior to December
	31,2015 (the  Maturity Date ), the Company shall consummate a financing
	round led by unaffiliated investors in the amount of at least Euro 200,000,
	at a Company pre-money valuation on a fully diluted basis of at least Euro
	750,000 (a  Qualified Round ), the Holder shall be entitled (but not
	obligated) to convert the entire loan amount into the most senior class of
	shares of the Company issued in such Qualified Round, based on a price per
	share equal to the lower of the price per share reflected by a Company
	pre-money valuation on a fully diluted basis calculated at the time of
	conversion equal to Euro 1,500,000; or - price per share which reflects a
	20% discount on the lowest price per share issued pursuant to such Qualified
	Round. If upon the occurrence of such event the note holder elects not to

	non-convertible. 
	 On January 14 and 16, 2015, we issued two promissory notes in the amount

	Notes bears interest at the rate of 1% per annum, are due and payable on

	$528 loss on debt settlement due to the payment being higher than principal
	and accrued interest as of that date as well as a charge of $90,979
	considered a contribution of capital due to the fact that note holder, IMWT,
	was a related party. 
	 We concluded that these notes have a stated rate of interest that is
	different from the rate of interest that is appropriate for this type of
	debt at the date of the transaction. Accordingly, the company imputed
	interest at an appropriate rate estimated at 8% as prescribed under FASB ASC
	835. The resultant charge of $6,280 for the period ending December 31, 2014

	the derivative was written off. 
	 As of December 31, 2015, the company has a $0 derivative liability and a
	$29,719 convertible note payable, net of discount of $0. As of September 30,
	2016, the company has $0 derivative liability and $337,971 of convertible
	notes payable, net of discount of $475,049. 
	 In accordance to ASC #815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
	Hedging Activities, we evaluated the holder's non-detachable conversion
	right provision and liquidated damages clause, contained in the terms
	governing the Note to determine whether the features qualify as an embedded
	derivative instrument at issuance. Such non-detachable conversion right
	provision and liquidated damages clause did not need to be accounted for as
	derivative financial instruments. Additionally, since the conversion price
	of the two notes represented the fair market value of the Company's common
	stock at the time of issuance, no beneficial conversion feature exists. We
	believe that the Company's shares of common stock are and have been very
	thinly traded during the last 3 years and that the fair value of the stock
	price was deemed not to be a fair value. Management decided that because the
	Company's ability to continue as a going concern was in question and that it
	has no revenue sources that the conversion price was a better measure of
	fair market value. Based on that decision, no beneficial conversion feature
	was reflected in the financial statements and the $20,165 extinguishment of
	debt was reflected in the current period earnings and $0 extinguishment of
	debt was reflected in the current period earnings. 
	  Note 9. Other Receivables  
	 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had other
	receivables of $5,567 and $25,797, respectively, which represent VAT refunds
	claimed resulting from excess VAT paid over VAT received. 
	  Note 10. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities  
	 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accounts
	payable and accrued liabilities of $129,420 and $90,705, respectively. 
	  Note 11. Subsequent Events  
	 As of September 9, 2016 (the  Effective Date ) and subject to the
	acceptance of certain appointments and engagements as set forth below, the

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION   
 Back to Table of
Contents    

	  The following plan of operation provides
information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and
understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The
discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto.
This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our
current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect,
estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which,
by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on
these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject
to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our predictions.  

Plan of Operations  

  We
are a digital health startup company engaged in the development, sale and service of imaging solutions utilizing our proprietary
DermaCompare software that we developed for use in derma imaging and analytics (our  DermaCompare  or  Product ).
In our development of the DermaCompare technology, we utilized the knowledge learned from advanced military image processing and
data analytics to improve the analysis of medical images for the benefit of patients and the medical community. We believe that
our proprietary DermaCompare software represents an advancement in skin cancer screening that should enable physicians to more
readily identify and monitor changes in their patients  skin characteristics.  

DermaCompare
is Emerald s first application of its technology, which we believe represents an advance in the early detection of skin
cancer. DermaCompare is based on automated image analytics software using advanced algorithms for alignment, anchoring, identifying
and detecting changes in the shapes, colors and sizes of skin lesions, which could potentially become Melanoma. We apply our DermaCompare
technology in image capture, correction and intelligent data extraction in the market for derma imaging products.  

Our
DermaCompare solution allows dermatologists and other medical care professionals, using a set of 25 total body photography ( TBP ),
to capture sets of skin lesion images with, among other devices, digital cameras, camera-equipped smart phones or tablets. These
images are then transmitted online and are remotely analyzed by professionals using our DermaCompare software.  

Our
DermaCompare imaging software has 2 main modules:  

A
    SaaS cloud-based Dr. Module that can be launched on any desktop computer connected to the Internet; or   

Mobile
    APP for mass population uses can be installed on smart phones or tablets with iOS or Android operating systems.    

Our
future plans also contemplate the use of wearable computing and imaging devices such as Google glasses or other comparable devices.  

Our
sales and marketing plan, which has already commenced, is to sell licenses for our DermaCompare imaging software to: NHSs, HMOs, health insurance companies,
hospitals and medical clinics through distributers, health care channel partners or directly through independent salespersons
and/or web purchase to dermatologists and other physicians (GPs) that we expect to purchase licenses based on the number of potential
numbers of patients.  

In furtherance of our business plan, which has resulted in us becoming an
	operating company, Emerald has entered into a series of agreements with
	unaffiliated third parties for the distribution of its DermaCompare
	Technology, as follows: 

1. On August 12, 2013, Emerald entered into an
	exclusive distribution with Derma Italy Sri, organized under the laws of the
	Italy ( Derma Italy ), pursuant to which Derma Italy was granted exclusive
	distribution rights in Italy; 2. On December 1, 2013, Emerald entered
	into a distribution agreement with S. Bokhorst - Creatiekracht, organized
	under the laws of the Netherlands, pursuant to which S. Bokhorst was granted
	exclusive distribution in the Netherlands;  3. On February 6, 2014,
	Emerald entered into a distribution agreement with Medical Edge Pty Ltd,
	organized under the laws of Australia ( Medical Edge ), pursuant to which
	Medical Edge was granted exclusive distribution rights in the markets of
	Australia, New Zealand and Oceania; 4. On
	January 14, 2015, Emerald entered into a Project Agreement with Realize S.A.
	and Ubitech, entities engaged in IT related to medical technology in Greece,
	and MEDISP and MPUoP, academic and research institutes in Greece
	(collectively, the  Greek Partners ). Emerald and the Greek Partners
	anticipate imminent grants from the Office of Chief Scientist of the State
	of Israel and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology of Greece,
	respectively, the proceeds of which will be used for development of enhanced
	smartphone applications for diagnosis of early stage Melanoma. 

During
the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we raised $783,054 through the
	issuance of convertible notes and we may be expected to require up to an additional $1.5 million in capital during the next 12 months to
fully implement
our business plan and fund our operations.  

Utilizing capital raised, Emerald completed the development of a commercial model of
its DermaCompare Product and has commenced marketing efforts. Emerald is
continuing to negotiate additional distribution agreements for territories
including North America, Latin America, Southern Africa, Israel and elsewhere in
Europe, among other countries and regions. Emerald fully expects to
significantly increase the level of its business activities during the 4th
quarter of 2015 and expects to generate significant revenues from its
DermaCompare Technology commencing in or before the first half of fiscal 2016.
Emerald is continuing to work on development of the  next generation 
DermaCompare Technology, with enhanced features.

	have unqualified audit opinion for the period ended September 30, 2016 with
	an explanatory paragraph on going concern. 
	 In view of these matters, realization of a major portion of the assets in
	the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the

	additional equity financing will provide the opportunity to continue as a
	going concern.
