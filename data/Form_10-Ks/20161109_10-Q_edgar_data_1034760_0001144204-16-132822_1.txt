WIDEPOINT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

1.  Organization and Nature of Operations 

Organization  

WidePoint Corporation
( WidePoint  or the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on May 30, 1997. The Company is a global provider
of information technology (IT) based products, services, and solutions. The Company offers secure, cloud-based, enterprise-wide
information technology-based solutions that enable commercial markets, and federal and state government organizations, to deploy
fully compliant IT services in accordance with government-mandated regulations and advanced system requirements. The Company has
sales and operational offices strategically located throughout the continental United States, Ireland, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom. The Company s principal executive and administrative headquarters is located in McLean, Virginia. 

Nature of Operations  

We provide secure,
cloud-based, enterprise-wide information technology (IT) solutions to commercial enterprises, federal state and foreign governments
in many different industry sectors. Our IT solutions are accessible on-demand through cloud computing and provide our customers
with a set of streamlined mobile communications management, identity management, and consulting solutions that provide our customers
with the ability to manage, analyze and protect their valuable communications assets, and deploy compliant identity management
solutions that provide secured virtual and physical access to restricted environments. We use proprietary software, analytical
tools and reporting solutions that enable our customers to actively manage their fixed and mobile communications assets and expenses
and identity management requirements in an efficient and cost-effective manner in a safe and secure environment anywhere in the
world. 

The Company s
operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the number of billable days
in a quarter, the timing of the pass-through of other direct costs, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular
quarter, the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts, the term of each contract awarded and general economic
conditions. A significant portion of the Company s expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short
term. Successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or
completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. 

2.  Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, included herein have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Pursuant to such regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have
been condensed or omitted. It is the opinion of management that all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary
for a fair statement of financial results are reflected in the financial statements for the interim periods presented. The condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited condensed consolidated financial statements included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

7   

Principles of Consolidation  

The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and acquired entities
since their respective dates of acquisition. All significant inter-company amounts were eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications  

The Company
reclassified amounts representing product development previously included in the caption  general and administrative expenses 
in the comparative statement of operations presentation as a separate line item to conform to the current year presentation. 

Foreign Currency  

Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting
period. The resulting translation adjustments, along with any related tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive
(loss) income, a component of stockholders  equity. Translation adjustments are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or
substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange
rates during the year. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency, including operations
outside the U.S. where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported net in the Company s Consolidated Statements
of Operations, depending on the nature of the activity. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. The more significant areas requiring use of estimates and judgment relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable valuation
reserves, ability to realize intangible assets and goodwill, ability to realize deferred income tax assets, fair value of certain
financial instruments and the evaluation of contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Significant Accounting Policies  

There have been no
significant changes in the Company s significant accounting policies during the first nine months of 2016 from those disclosed
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016. 

Segment Reporting  

Our customers and the
industry view our market as a singular business and demand an integrated and scalable suite of information technology-based enterprise-wide
solutions. Our information technology service offerings comprise a single business from which the Company earns revenues and incurs
costs. The Company s information technology service offerings are centrally managed and reported on that basis to its Chief
Operating Decision Maker who evaluates its business as a single segment. See Note 13 for detailed information regarding the composition
of information technology services.

Accounting Standards Update  

In March 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which amended certain existing illustrative
examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The new standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU
2016-08 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition
method, adoption date, or determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
(Part 1), which included amendments to: 1) remove the requirement to defer recognition of excess tax benefits until such deduction
results in a reduction in tax expense, 2) exclude excess tax benefits when applying the treasury stock method to compute diluted
earnings per share, 3) clarify that excess tax benefits should be classified within the operating section of the statement of cash
flows, and 4) estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation cost. The new standard is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The standard should be applied on a retrospective basis as of the
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented and presented as a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect
on retained earnings and other components of equity disclosed. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09
will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method,
adoption date, or determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). The new guidance is intended to reduce
the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows. The core principle of the ASU requires the classification of eight specific cash flow issues identified under
ASC 230 to be presented as either financing, investing or operating, or some combination thereof, depending upon the nature
of the issue. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning
after December 15, 2017. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a retrospective transition approach
for all of the issues identified to each period presented. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will
have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In October 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
(Part 2), which included amendments to clarify statutory tax withholding requirements, classification of such taxes when paid by
the employer and simplification of certain disclosures for privately-held companies. The new standard is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The standard should be applied on a retrospective basis
as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented and presented as a change in accounting principle with the cumulative
effect on retained earnings and other components of equity disclosed. The Company has elected to adopt this ASU ahead of the effective
date as permitted. The early adoption of this ASU will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements and
disclosures as the Company s existing practices are similar to those included in this ASU.

7.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets   

The Company has recorded
goodwill of $18,555,578 as of September 30, 2016. There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the nine

and $803,500, respectively. The total weighted remaining average life of purchased and internally developed intangible assets is
approximately 5.8 years at September 30, 2016. 

8.  Line of Credit and Long Term Debt 

Commercial Loan Agreement Facility  

On April 28, 2016,
the Company entered into a Business Loan Agreement with Cardinal Bank (the  Loan Agreement ). On November 4, 2016, the Company entered into a modification of its Loan Agreement that: 1) decreased the Company s borrowing
base as a percentage of qualified government and commercial receivables from 75% to 65% and 2) decreased the minimum after-tax
net income requirement from $200,000 to $1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

11   

The Loan Agreement
is for $6.0 million and extended the maturity date of the credit facility is April 30, 2017. The available amount under the revolving
line of credit is subject to a borrowing base, which is equal to the lesser of (i) $6.0 million or (ii) 65% of qualified government
and commercial accounts receivables, less any amounts outstanding on the Company s $4.0 million term loan with Cardinal Bank.
The interest rate for the revolving line of credit is the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 0.75%, with a floor of 4.25%. 

The Loan Agreement
requires that the Company (i) maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least $6.5 million at December 31, 2016; (ii) generate a minimum after-tax net income of at least $1.00 for the third and  for the fourth quarter of 2016 and (iii) maintain a current ratio of 1.1:1 tested quarterly. 

Under the credit
facility  the Company was advanced approximately $18.2 million and repaid
approximately $18.1 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. There was approximately $0.1 million
outstanding against the Company s credit facility at September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was not
in compliance with its minimum after tax net income requirement of at least $1.00 for the third quarter; however, the Company obtained a waiver for such
non-compliance from Cardinal Bank. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was eligible to borrow up to $5.6 million under the
borrowing base formula. 

Long-Term Debt  

Long-term debt consisted
of the following: 

(1) On December 17, 2010,
the Company entered into a real estate purchase agreement to acquire operations and call center facility in Columbus, Ohio for
approximately $677,000. In connection with the real estate purchase agreement, the Company entered into a $528,000 ten-year mortgage
with Cardinal Bank to fund the unpaid portion of the purchase price. The mortgage loan bears interest at 6.0% with monthly principal
and interest payments of approximately $3,800, and matures on December 17, 2020. The mortgage loan principal and interest payments
are based on a twenty-year amortization with the unpaid balance due at maturity. The mortgage loan is secured by the real estate. 

(2) On December 31, 2011,
the Company entered into a $4.0 million 5-year term note with Cardinal Bank ( Cardinal Bank Term Note ) to fund a portion
of the purchase price paid in connection with the asset purchase agreement with Avalon Global Solutions, Inc. ( AGS )
dated December 30, 2011. The term note bears interest at 4.5% with monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $74,694,
and matures on December 30, 2016. The term note is secured under a corporate security agreement. 

Capital Lease Obligations  

The Company has leased
certain equipment and automobiles under capital lease arrangements that expire in 2017. There were no changes
to existing lease arrangements during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. 

12   

9.  Income Taxes   

The Company files
U.S. federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) as well as income tax returns in various
states and certain foreign countries. The Company may be subject to examination by the IRS or various state taxing jurisdictions
for tax years 2003 and forward. The Company may be subject to examination by various foreign countries for tax years 2014 forward.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company was not under examination by the IRS, any state or foreign tax jurisdiction. The Company
did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at either September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. In the future if applicable, any
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $29.8 million reflecting the benefit of approximately $26.8
million in net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes,
net of the potential Section 382 limitations. These federal NOL carry forwards expire between 2017 and 2032. Included in the recorded
deferred tax asset, the Company had a benefit of approximately $29.8 million available to offset future taxable income for state
income tax purposes. These state NOL carry forwards expire between 2024 and 2032. Because of the change of ownership provisions
of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, use of a portion of our domestic NOL may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the
carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. 

Management assesses
the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing
deferred tax assets. Under existing income tax accounting standards such objective evidence is more heavily weighted in comparison
to other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth, tax planning and other tax strategies. A significant piece
of objective negative evidence considered in management s evaluation of the realizability of its deferred tax assets was
the existence of cumulative losses over the latest three-year period. Management forecast future taxable income, but concluded
that there may not be enough of a recovery before the end of the fiscal year to overcome the negative objective evidence of three
years of cumulative losses. On the basis of this evaluation, management recorded a valuation allowance against all deferred tax
assets. If management s assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets, the tax
benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income
tax expense.

Stock Incentive Plan  

The Company adopted
the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2008 Plan ) on December 18, 2008. The 2008 Plan was amended and restated on December

the grant or award of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
dividend equivalent rights, performance unit awards and phantom shares. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon the
exercise of stock options. Any shares associated with forfeited awards are added back to the number of shares to be granted under

detail below. 

Restricted Stock Awards  

On November 18, 2010,
the Company s Compensation Committee granted Steve L. Komar and James T. McCubbin each an award of 250,000 shares of restricted
stock of the Company, the vesting of which is based upon the earlier to occur of (a) the seventh anniversary date of the grant,
or (b) an acceleration event set forth in the award agreement with respect to such grant. 

A summary of RSA activity
as of September 30, 2016, and changes during nine month period ended September 30, 2016 is set forth below: 

(1)  The Company issued 209,438 shares of the Company s common stock in connection with
                                                                                   this                                                                                    accelerated vesting event, of which
                                                                                   Mr. Komar received 125,000 shares and Mr. McCubbin received 84,438 shares. Mr. McCubbin received less than 125,000 shares
                                                                                   because he elected                                                                                    to have 40,562 of such
                                                                                   shares withheld in satisfaction of the corresponding tax liability of approximately $32,300. The
                                                                                   Company's payment of this tax liability was recorded as a cash flow from financing activity on the Condensed Consolidated
                                                                                   Statements of Cashflows. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $50,800 of total unamortized RSA
compensation expense, related to the remaining 250,000 unvested RSAs that will be recognized over the weighted average remaining
period of 1.2 years. The total intrinsic value of RSAs vested during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
$185,000. The intrinsic value of outstanding RSAs as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $107,500. 

Stock Option Awards  

   The Company granted 650,000 stock options during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016. The Company granted 180,000 stock options during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. A summary
of stock option activity as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and changes during nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 is set forth below: 

14   

During the nine month period ended September
30, 2016, there were stock options of 392,000 that were cancelled, of which 205,000 were cancelled due to termination of employment
and the remainder expired unexercised at the end of the option term. 

The weighted-average
remaining contractual life and the aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the fair value of the Company s stock exceeds
the exercise price of the option) of the stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest as of September
30, 2016 are as follows: 

Vested and       
     Outstanding     

Expected to       
     and     

Outstanding       
     Vest       
     Exercisable     

(Unaudited)

     Aggregate intrinsic value    
     $  -       
     $  -       
     $  -     

Aggregate intrinsic value represents
total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between WidePoint s closing stock price on September 30, 2016 and the
exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all
option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2016. There was no intrinsic value associated with options
outstanding, exercisable and expected to vest as of September 30, 2016 as the stock price was below the lowest option
exercise price. The intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of WidePoint s stock. The total
intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $713,400. 

Share-based compensation
(including restricted stock awards) represents both stock options based expense and stock grant expense. For the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized share-based compensation expense of approximately $68,100
and $89,200, $204,400 and $208,100, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $320,700 of total unamortized
compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock option plans that will be recognized over the weighted average
remaining period of 2.2 years.      

15   

12.      Earnings Per Common
Share (EPS)   

The computations of
basic and diluted EPS were as follows for the periods presented below: 

The dilutive effect
of unexercised stock options and restricted stock awards excludes 2,115,668 and 1,857,668 of options from the computation of EPS
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have
been anti-dilutive.

Business Overview 

We are a leading provider
of federally certified secure identity management and communications solutions to the government and commercial sectors. Our on-demand
solutions offer a suite of advanced and federally certified proprietary cloud-based software solutions designed to enable secure
identity management and manage the complex processes and expenses associated with complex communication assets and services of
any enterprise. For additional information related to our business operations see the description of our business set forth in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.  

Strategic Re-Focus 

Our objective is to
grow our business profitably as a premier technology-based provider of both product and service enterprise solutions to both the
public and private sectors. We are continuing to work to re-focus our strategy in order to improve cash flows by focusing our
efforts on selling our higher margin services and de-emphasizing some of our lower margin services. We are also working to develop
a more streamlined sales process in order to increase our market penetration. 

We believe our portfolio of solutions,
including Cert-on-Device, Derived Credentialing and other mobile credentialing solutions, address access to multi-level secure
resources and message traffic based on entity identity, roles and privileges that can be validated by any logical and/or physical
access point on a multitude of devices. 

18   

Our challenge is reaching
potential customers and in order to gain market penetration as an organization capable of meeting an organization s technology
asset and risk management objectives without significantly increasing their operating costs and allowing these organizations to
focus on running their business. Generating positive cash flow and net income in the future will depend on our ability to successfully
execute our on our strategy of growing of business through sales of higher margin services. As a challenge to our re-focus, a
significant source of our operating revenue is derived from fixed price contracts that may range from two (2) to five (5) years
that in many instances include certain volume pricing discounts. 

Our profitability
depends upon the type and volume of services performed, our ability to properly price our services, our ability to manage client
service deliverables and expectations, and our ability cost effectively delivery our solutions without manually intensive labor
requirements. To date, we have attempted to maximize our operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of our proprietary
technologies and methodologies, and by offsetting increases in consultant salaries with increases in consultant fees received
from our clients. 

There is no guarantee
that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future and an inability to successfully achieve profitability
will decrease our long-term viability.  

Expansion of customer
contracts, our internal growth initiatives and merger and acquisition opportunities will increase our operational costs and
may require additional investments in technology infrastructure and personnel.  In May 2016, we hired Mr. Jason Holloway
as our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer to assist us in delivering high-level revenue-building strategies and team leadership
to drive new business and expand our current work with existing client. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
as Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues. 
Revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $22.1 million, an increase of
approximately $5.1 million (or 30% of revenues), as compared to approximately $17.0 million in 2015. This improvement in
revenues was driven by increases in both carrier services and managed services. Our mix of revenues for the periods presented is set forth below: 

We believe the following factors
contributed to higher revenues: 

Our                                          carrier services were higher due to an increase
                                                                                                               in carrier service task orders issued                                          and delivered during the quarter under our
                                                                                                               U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) blanket purchase agreement ( BPA ). There presently are two major components
                                                                                                               agencies remaining under our DHS BPA contract that have not yet issued initial task orders:
                                                                                                               the U.S. Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Our carrier services revenues could continue to expand
                                                                                                               if any of these remaining agencies                                          issue task order awards. Carrier services could
                                                                                                               increase or decrease as a result of the                                          number of mobile devices under management
                                                                                                               and the extent of usage of those mobile devices.   

Our
    managed services were higher as a result of increases in identity credentialing and services, mobile device and accessory
    services, partially     offset by     the negative impact of the decline in Pound Sterling currency denominated contracts.
    There were a number of new revenue generating     contracts that     were delayed due to the decision of the     United
    Kingdom     (U.K.) to exit the European Union common community (Brexit) and other regulatory matters.   

We believe the expansion of our revenues is tied to several factors including winning additional task order awards from the
two remaining major component agencies under DHS BPA contract, continued expansion and emphasis of selling high margin services
to our large enterprise and federal customers, and the successful delivery of our new identity management offering that include
 Certificate on Device ,  machine to machine  credentials, and  derived credentials  to
our target markets through both our new and existing channel partners. 

19   

Cost of Revenues.
 Cost of revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $18.1 million (or 82% of revenues),
as compared to approximately $13.9 million (or 82% of revenues) in 2015. Cost of revenue on a dollar and percentage basis did
not vary materially quarter over quarter because our cost of revenues mix shifted on a dollar basis from reselling purchases in
2015 to carrier services purchases in 2016. Cost of revenues could fluctuate depending on our sales mix between carrier services
and managed services. 

Gross
Profit.  Gross profit for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $4.0 million (or 18% of
revenues), as compared to approximately $3.1 million (or 18% of revenues) in 2015. The increase in gross profit was largely
related to increases in credentialing and mobile services, partially offset by decreases in consulting services and foreign
currency fluctuations. 

Sales and Marketing.
 Sales and marketing expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $0.6 million (or 3% of revenues),
as compared to approximately $0.8 million (or 5% of revenues) in 2015. The decline in sales and marketing reflects continued changes
made during the first and second quarter of 2016 to streamline our sales labor resources and sales commission agreements in a
manner that incentivizes our salesforce to pursue and close recurring higher margin business. We may realize an increase in sales
and marketing expenses as a result of the successful introduction of our recent channel partner strategy coupled with the introduction
of our next generation identity management services. 

General and Administrative.
 General and administrative expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $3.4 million (or
16% of revenues), as compared to approximately $3.6 million (or 21% of revenues) in 2015. General and administrative expense decreased
due to changes made during the second quarter of 2016 to lower the rates charged by our outside consultants and other discretionary
advisors. In the short term we may experience an increase in audit and tax related costs as we approach our year end. In the long run
we may realize a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of technology improvements that will allow
us to reduce overhead costs as we optimize our operating environment and streamline our processes. 

Product
Development.  Product development costs for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $2,600
(or less than 1% of revenues), as compared to approximately $268,800 (or 2% of revenues) in 2015. We capitalized
approximately $246,900 in internally developed software costs, of which $127,300 related to Certificate-on-Device (CoD)
credentialing tools and applications and $119,600 related to costs associated with certification of our Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) authority to operate and issue identity credentials. We anticipate additional capitalization of software costs
during the fourth quarter of 2016. The costs associated with maintaining and developing new products and services is vital to
our ability to compete in our market place and deliver solutions that our customers believe meet or exceed their
requirements. These costs over time may rise and fall as we continue to support the go to market efforts for new product
solutions. 

Depreciation and
Amortization.  Overhead and administrative related depreciation and amortization expense for the three month period ended September
30, 2016 was approximately $84,800 as compared to approximately $93,000 in 2015.  There were no material increases in
our depreciable asset base during the quarter. 

20   

Interest Income.
 Interest income for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $3,000, as compared to approximately
$7,000 in 2015.  The decrease was due to lower amounts of cash and cash equivalents being held in interest bearing accounts
and the length of time those deposits were earning interest throughout the quarter compared to 2015.   

Interest Expense.
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $20,900 as
compared to approximately $30,900 in 2015.  The decrease in interest expense is due to repayment of over $2.0 million in
principal payments during the third quarter of 2015. There were no significant changes in the interest rate associated with debt
repaid during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

Income Taxes.
 Income tax expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $8,300, as compared to approximately
$69,800 in 2015.  Income tax expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 predominantly consist of current
taxes payable on foreign earnings in the Republic of Ireland, largely offset by tax benefits realized due to vesting of restricted
stock awards during the quarter. 

Net (Loss) Income.
 As a result of the cumulative factors annotated above, the net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $148,000, as compared to approximately $1.8 million in the same period last year.

Revenues. 
Revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $60.2 million, an increase of approximately
$8.0 million (or 15% of revenues) as compared to approximately $52.1 million in 2015. Our mix of revenues for the periods
presented is set forth below: 

We believe the following factors contributed
to higher revenues: 

Our
                                         carrier services were higher compared to the same period last year as a result of the
                                         recognition of task orders implemented and related to our DHS BPA contract.   

Our
                                         managed services were lower due to a decrease of approximately $2.6 million in software
                                         reselling activities (approximately $3.1 million in 2016 as compared to approximately
                                         $5.7 million in 2015), partially offset by an increase in mobile device accessory sales
                                         (approximately $2.0 million in 2016 as compared to approximately $0.6 million in 2015)
                                         and expansion of managed services for existing customers. Additionally, our revenues were lower due to the negative impact of approximately $203,000 in currency fluctuations related
to Brexit.   

Cost of Revenues.
 Cost of revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $48.6 million (or 81% of revenues),
as compared to approximately $42.1 million (or 81% of revenues) in 2015. The dollar basis increase was due to higher carrier services
cost and higher labor costs required to manually fulfill a large number of task orders issued by federal customers with decentralized
operations, partially offset by lower reselling costs. We are proactively working with our federal customers that have highly
decentralized operational centers to consolidate and streamline their service delivery requirements. 

Gross Profit.
 Gross profit for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $11.6 million (or 19% of revenues), as compared
to approximately $10.0 million (or 19% of revenues) in 2015. The dollar basis increase in gross profit was the result of higher
margin device and accessory sales and to a lesser extent a higher ratio of high margin managed services as compared to 2015. Our
gross profit may fluctuate depending on the ratio of managed services to carrier services. 

21   

Sales and Marketing.
 Sales and marketing expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2.1 million (or 3% of revenues),
as compared to approximately $2.3 million (or 4% of revenues) in 2015. The decline in sales and marketing reflects continued changes
made during the first and second quarter of 2016 to streamline our sales labor resources and sales commission agreements in a
manner that incentivizes our salesforce to pursue and close recurring higher margin business. 

General and Administrative.
 General and administrative expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $10.6 million (or
18% of revenues), as compared to approximately $11.0 million (or 21% of revenues) in 2015. General and administrative expense
decreased due to changes made during the first and second quarter of 2016 to lower office rent and the rates charged by our outside
consultants and other discretionary advisors. 

Product
Development.  Product development costs for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $261,000 (or
1% of revenues), as compared to approximately $228,000 (or 1% of revenues) in 2015. We capitalized approximately $480,300 in
internally developed software costs of which $343,900 related to CoD  credentialing tools and applications, $119,600 related
to costs associated with our  PKI authority to operate and issue identity credentials and the remainder related to other
software applications. The costs associated with maintaining and developing new products and services is vital to our ability
to compete in our market place and deliver solutions that our customers believe meet or exceed their requirements. These
costs over time may rise and fall as we continue to support the development and go to market efforts for new product
solutions. 

Depreciation and
Amortization.  Overhead and administrative related depreciation and amortization expense for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 was approximately $269,000 as compared to approximately $283,200 in 2015.  The decrease reflects a lower depreciable
base due to fully depreciated assets.      

Interest Income.
 Interest income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $10,600, as compared to approximately
$17,900 in 2015.  The decrease was due to lower amounts of cash and cash equivalents being held in interest bearing
accounts and the length of time those deposits were earning interest throughout the quarter compared to 2015.  

Interest Expense.
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $61,100 as compared
to approximately $111,250 in 2015.  The decrease in interest expense is due to repayment of over $2.0 million in principal
payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were no significant changes in the interest rate associated with
long term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

Income Taxes.
 Income tax expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $21,000, as compared to approximately
$147,200 in 2015.  Income tax expense predominantly consists of current taxes payable on foreign earnings in the Republic
of Ireland; however, these taxes have been largely offset by tax benefits realized due to vesting of restricted stock awards during
the first quarter of 2016. 

Net (Loss) Income.
 As a result of the cumulative factors annotated above, the net loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $1.7 million, as compared to approximately $4.3 million in 2015.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has, since
inception, financed its operations and capital expenditures through cash generated from operations, access to a credit facility,
the sale of stock, seller notes in connection with acquisitions, convertible notes, convertible exchangeable debentures, senior
secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture. The Company s
immediate sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and access to a working
capital credit facility with Cardinal Bank (see Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for
a description of our credit facility with Cardinal Bank). 

At September 30, 2016,
the Company s net working capital was approximately $7.0 million as compared to approximately $8.0 million at December 31,
2015. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to net losses incurred while continuing to fund business development
efforts and additional product development and promotion costs to bring our Certificate-on-Device solution to market. We utilized
available cash and our line of credit to manage through short term collection timing differences during the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016. 

22   

We must successfully
execute our business plan to increase profitability in order to achieve positive cash flows to sustain adequate liquidity without
requiring additional funds from external sources to meet minimum operating requirements. We may need to raise additional capital
or seek alternative debt financing to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available
on acceptable terms or at all. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating
activities provides an indication of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our recurring business activities. Fixed
costs such as labor, direct materials, network and data charges, software and subscription costs and office rent represent a significant
portion of the Company s continuing operating costs. Any changes in the Company s fixed operating cost structure may
not be immediately reflected in financial performance, depending upon the nature of the change made, and the required time to
implement. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operations was approximately $1.2 million driven by current year operating losses,
foreign currency transaction losses and temporary collection timing differences. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operations was approximately $2.8 million driven by our decision to fund sales and
development investments and maintain critical staffing infrastructure to support implementation of DHS BPA task orders and product
development efforts for our next generation identity management solutions. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing
activities provides an indication of our long term infrastructure investments. We make recurring purchases of property and equipment
to replace or enhance our hardware and software applications that support customer operations. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.6 million and consisted of capitalized internally
developed software costs substantially related to our Certificate-on-Device credentialing tools and applications; and to a lesser
extent normal replacements of computers and peripheral equipment used in operating and administrative functions. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.5 million and consisted of capitalized internally
development software costs related to our Public Key Infrastructure software certificate credentialing tools and applications
and continuing property and equipment expenditures aimed at enhancing our internal infrastructure to support Certificate-on-Device
growth. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

Cash provided by (used
in) financing activities provides an indication of our debt financing and proceeds from capital raise transactions and stock option
exercises. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $0.6 million primarily reflecting scheduled
term debt repayments of approximately $0.7 million, partially offset by net line of credit advances. The Company was advanced
approximately $18.2 million and repaid approximately $18.1 million in line of credit advances. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $0.7 million primarily reflecting scheduled
term debt repayments of approximately $2.0 million, partially offset by net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million from the exercise
of stock options. The Company was advanced approximately $15.8 million and repaid approximately $13.8 million in line of credit
advances. 

23   

Net Effect of Exchange Rate on Cash
and Equivalents  

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the net effect of exchange rate changes increased the translated value of our foreign cash balances
due to appreciation of the Euro relative to the US dollar. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the net effect of exchange rate changes decreased the translated value of our foreign cash balances
due to depreciation of the Euro relative to the US dollar. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The
Company has no existing off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC regulations.   

ITEM 3.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK    

There has been no
material change in the Company s exposure to market risk from the information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on the existence of the material weaknesses discussed below in  Material
Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,  our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide
such reasonable assurances. 

We do not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we
have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures is
also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Material Weakness in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting  

A material weakness
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of December 31, 2015 due to the existence of the material weaknesses as of December 31, 2015, discussed below. A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified material
weaknesses in controls over financial reporting related to inadequate transactional level controls over contract management and
billing and inadequate entity level controls. Management has determined that we lack adequate documentation to provide evidence
of operating effectiveness related to contract management and billing and entity level controls. 

24   

Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses  

The material
weaknesses described above comprise control deficiencies that we discovered during our assessment of ICOFR and were not
remediated during the financial close process for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. Management started to
implement its remediation plan during the third quarter of 2016 and such efforts were focused on: 1) evaluating contract and
billing solutions that are capable of managing internal workflow and changes and delivering invoices to customers; 2)
evaluating electronic payroll solutions that are capable of replacing  largely manual human resources, timekeeping
and payroll processing functions currently used throughout the Company; and 3) retaining documentation to evidence
effectiveness of entity level controls. Management is also evaluating certain workflow technologies that may be capable of
further streamlining largely manual financial reporting processes. Management believes that as its plan is implemented it
will remediate identified material weaknesses identified.  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

Other than as described
above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent
limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may
vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms at varying management levels throughout the Company, and actions
are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.
