FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements  regarding the plans and objectives of management
for future operations and market trends and expectations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based
on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions
involving the continued expansion of our business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among
other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible
to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking
statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person
that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements
for any reason. The terms  we ,  our ,  us , or any derivative thereof, as used herein refer
to Newtown Lane Marketing, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors.

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY 

Newtown Lane Marketing, Incorporated ( we ,
 our ,  us  or  Newtown ) was incorporated in Delaware on September 26, 2005. We previously
held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen's Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida
and Pennsylvania, and in Suffolk County, New York, which Dreesen retained for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control,
as detailed below, and we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen's Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen
expired on December 31, 2007. 

The interim financial information as of September
30, 2016 and for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared without audit, pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate
to provide for fair presentation. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the
notes thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, previously filed with the
SEC. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of our financial position as of September 30,
2016 and results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have
been made. The results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results that may be expected for the full fiscal year or any future periods. 

EQUITY TRANSACTIONS 

On August 8, 2007 (the  Effective Date ),
we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Moyo Partners, LLC, a New York limited liability
company ( Moyo ) and R R Biotech Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( R R  collectively
with Moyo, the  Purchasers ), pursuant to which we sold to them, in the aggregate, approximately, four million four
hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4,479,250) shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Common
Stock ) and   five hundred (500 )  shares   of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share ( Series
A Preferred Stock ), each share convertible at the option of the holder into, approximately, fourteen thousand eight hundred
twenty (14,820) shares of Common Stock, for aggregate gross   proceeds to us of $600,000. The shares of Series A Preferred
Stock were convertible only to the extent there were a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon
any such conversion. 

On the Effective Date: (i) the Purchasers acquired
control of Newtown, with (a) R R acquiring nine million five hundred nine thousand four hundred forty (9,509,440) shares of
Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R R of the four hundred (400) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand (5,928,000) shares of Common Stock) constituting
72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (b) Moyo acquiring two million three hundred seventy seven thousand
three hundred sixty (2,377,360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series
A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred
ten (1,481,510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in
full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $960,000 (the  December
Notes ), the Note holders of the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479,811 of principal and accrued interest into
274,200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount of $625,030 for the remaining principal
balance. 

On the Effective Date: (i) Arnold P. Kling
was appointed to our Board of Directors ( Board ) and served together with Vincent J. McGill, a then current director
who continued to serve until August 20, 2007, the effective date of his resignation from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers
and directors, with the exception of Mr. McGill, resigned from their respective positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr.
Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary; and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham,
New Jersey. 

Following Mr. McGill s resignation from
our Board on August 20, 2007, Mr. Kling became our sole director and president.

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY (continued): 

On October 19, 2007, we put into effect an
amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100,000,000 the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available
for issuance (the  Charter Amendment ). As a result of the Charter Amendment, as of October 19, 2007, we had adequate
shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock. 

On December 19, 2007, the holders of all the
issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of their shares into shares of Common Stock. As
a result, the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for 7,407,540 shares of Common Stock, and all 500
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of undesignated preferred
stock, par value $.001 per shares. 

On August 15, 2008 (the  Series A Preferred
Elimination Date ), all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued
shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of
the Series A Preferred Elimination Date. 

On August 29, 2008 (the  Reverse Split
Effective Date ), we implemented a 1 for 50 reverse stock split (the  Reverse Split ) of the Common Stock. Pursuant
to the Reverse Split, each 50 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Reverse Split Effective Date was converted
into one (1) share of Common Stock. All share and per share data herein has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse
Split. 

In December 2008, we sold 550,000 shares of
Common Stock to Kirk Warshaw, our CFO, for $2,000. We determined such shares were issued below their fair value; hence $11,750
of compensation expense was recorded for the difference in value of the shares issued for cash versus fair value of such shares. 

On May 6, 2013, Ironbound Partners Fund, LLC
( Ironbound ) acquired 9,509,440 shares of Common Stock (the  Acquired Shares ) for an aggregate purchase
price of $15,000, or $0.00157737 per share. The Acquired Shares represent 69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock. The Acquired Shares were purchased by Ironbound, utilizing its available and uncommitted cash, from the Chapter 7 Trustee
of the Estates of Rodman   Renshaw, LLC ( Rodman ), Direct Markets, Inc., and Direct Markets Holdings, Corp. in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No.
13-10087, 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constitute all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R R, an
affiliate of Rodman. 

On May 14, 2013, Ironbound   related
party loaned $100,000 to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 to Ironbound (the  May
2013 Note ). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum,
payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the
consummation of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the  Conversion Price 
(as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with the Amended and Restated Note,
as described below. 

On August 15, 2013, we declared a stock dividend
on our outstanding Common Stock for stockholders of record as of August 15, 2013 (the  Record Date ). As a result,
all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock owned by them as of
the that date (the  2013 Stock Dividend ). All share and per share data herein has been retroactively restated to reflect
the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock Dividend, since the 2013 Stock Dividend was in substance a forward stock split. 

On July 25, 2014, we raised gross proceeds
of $72,000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and, in connection therewith, issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory
note (the  2014 Note ) in the principal amount of $72,000. The 2014 Note had a maturity date of August 31, 2015 (amended
as described below) and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on
the 2014 Note is convertible, at the election of Ironbound, into shares of our common stock following the consummation of a  Qualified
Financing  (as defined in the 2014 Note), or upon the consummation of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined
in the 2014 Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined in the 2014 Note).

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY (continued): 

Further, on July 25, 2014, we issued an amended
and restated convertible promissory note (the  Amended and Restated Note ) to Ironbound in the principal amount of
$100,000, in substitution for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August
31, 2015 (amended as described below) and provides for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible,
at the election of Ironbound, into shares of our common stock following the consummation of a  Qualified Financing 
(as defined in the May 2013 Note), or upon the consummation of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined in the May 2013
Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note otherwise remains unchanged. 

Effective September 1, 2015, the maturity dates
of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31, 2015 to August 31, 2016. 

On October 30, 2015, Mr. Kling resigned from
his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October 30, 2015, Mr. Warshaw resigned from his
positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling s and Warshaw s resignation were not due to any
disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company s operations, policies or practices.
Prior to Mr. Kling s resignation, our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky, the managing member of Ironbound,
our largest stockholder, to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling s resignation and will assume the role of President of
the Company. 

On April 1, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory
note (the  2016 Note  and together with the Prior Notes, the  Outstanding Notes ) in the principal amount
of $10,000 to Ironbound. The 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the 2016 Note was and will be utilized
by the Company to fund working capital needs. 

On July 15, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory
note (the  July 2016 Note ) in the principal amount of $25,000 to Ironbound Partners Fund, LLC. The July 2016 Note
has a maturity date of August 31, 2017 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and
accrued interest on the July 2016 Note is convertible, at the election of Ironbound, into shares of the Company s common
stock following the consummation of a  Qualified Financing  (as defined in the July 2016 Note), or upon the consummation
of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined in the July 2016 Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined
in the July 2016 Note). The proceeds of the July 2016 Note will be utilized by the Company to fund working capital needs. 

Effective September 1, 2016, the maturity dates of the Outstanding Notes was extended from August 31, 2016 to August 31, 2017. 

As of September 30, 2016, our authorized capital
stock consisted of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock of which 13,757,550 shares of Common
Stock, and no shares of Preferred Stock, were issued and outstanding. All shares of Common Stock currently outstanding are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 

During the three and six months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded a $ 2,500 and $1,250 contribution to capital, respectively, for the fair value relating to the use, occupancy
and administrative services rendered by the officers. 

THE COMPANY TODAY 

Since the Effective Date, our main purpose
has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a  shell  company in
as much as we are not generating revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in
a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our principal business objective
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating
business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific
business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities
will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officers and directors. We have no employees and no material assets.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Going Concern - The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
contemplates Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business
and we are currently considered a  shell  company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues, we do own an operating
business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be-identified operating
company or business. We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates
and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives
is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds
of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources
to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may, under
certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, unless additional financing is
obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business
combinations. There is no assurance that these plans will be realized in whole or in part. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Since inception, Newtown has incurred an accumulated
deficit of $2,301,810 through September 30, 2016. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, Newtown had net losses of $14,243
and $16,732, respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating activities since its inception. Newtown has spent,
and subject to obtaining additional financing, expects to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with executing its
business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Newtown s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Pursuant
to the FASB guidance,  Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,  we are required to estimate the fair value
of all financial instruments included on our balance sheet. We consider the carrying value of accrued expenses in the financial
statements to approximate their face value. 

Statements of Cash Flows - For purposes of
the statements of cash flows we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. 

NOTE 3   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Except as set forth below, management does not believe that any
other new accounting pronouncements not yet effective will have a material impact on our financial statements once adopted. 

In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-12,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period .  The amendments in
this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide
that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that
a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that
affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim
periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. The effective date is the
same for both public business entities and all other entities. 

Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either (a) prospectively
to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are
outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified
awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this ASU as of the beginning of the
earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings
balance at that date. Additionally, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing
the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition. 

NEWTOWN LANE MARKETING, INCORPORATED 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 September 30, 2016 

 (unaudited) 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on  Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern . Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote
disclosures. The amendments in this ASU provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in
the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue
as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically,
the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including
interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain
disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for
public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. 

NOTE 4   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The Company has evaluated all subsequent events and has determined
that there were no subsequent events to recognize or disclose in these financial statements except as follows: 

On November 11, 2016, the maturity dates of the Outstanding Notes was extended from August 31, 2016 to
August 31, 2017, effective as of September 1, 2016. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Use of Forward-Looking Statements  

Some of the statements in this Form 10-Q, including
some statements in  Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation  are forward-looking statements
about what may happen in the future. They include statements regarding our current beliefs, goals, and expectations about matters
such as our expected financial position and operating results, our business strategy, and our financing plans. These statements
can sometimes be identified by our use of forward-looking words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect, 
 intend,   may,   will,  and similar expressions. We cannot guarantee that our forward-looking
statements will turn out to be correct or that our beliefs and goals will not change. Our actual results could be very different
from and worse than our expectations for various reasons. You are urged to carefully consider these factors, as well as other information
contained in this Form 10-Q and in our other periodic reports and documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). 

In our Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the
year ended March 31, 2016, we have identified critical accounting policies and estimates for our business. 

Plan of Operation  

We are a corporation with limited operations
and have very limited revenues from our business operations since our incorporation in September 2005. Until December 31, 2007,
we held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen's Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida
and Pennsylvania, and in Suffolk County, New York, which Dreesen retained for itself. The license from Dreesen expired on December
31, 2007. 

On August 8, 2007 (the  Effective Date ),
we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Moyo Partners, LLC, a New York limited liability
company ( Moyo ) and R R Biotech Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( R R  collectively
with Moyo, the  Purchasers ), pursuant to which we sold to them, in the aggregate, approximately, four million four
hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4,479,250) shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Common
Stock ) and   five hundred (500 )  shares   of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share ( Series
A Preferred Stock ), each share convertible at the option of the holder into, approximately, fourteen thousand eight hundred
twenty (14,820) shares of Common Stock, for aggregate gross   proceeds to us of $600,000. The shares of Series A Preferred
Stock were convertible only to the extent there were a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon
any such conversion. 

On the Effective Date: (i) the Purchasers acquired
control of Newtown, with (a) R R acquiring nine million five hundred nine thousand four hundred forty (9,509,440) shares of
Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R R of the four hundred (400) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand (5,928,000) shares of Common Stock) constituting
72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (b) Moyo acquiring two million three hundred seventy seven thousand
three hundred sixty (2,377,360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series
A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred
ten (1,481,510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in
full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $960,000 (the  December
Notes ), the Note holders of the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479,811 of principal and accrued interest into
274,200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount of $625,030 for the remaining principal
balance. 

On the Effective Date: (i) Arnold P. Kling
was appointed to our Board of Directors ( Board ) and served together with Vincent J. McGill, a then current director
who continued to serve until August 20, 2007, the effective date of his resignation from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers
and directors, with the exception of Mr. McGill, resigned from their respective positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr.
Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary; and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham,
New Jersey. 

Following Mr. McGill s resignation from
our Board on August 20, 2007, Mr. Kling became our sole director and president. 

On October 19, 2007, we put into effect an
amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100,000,000 the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available
for issuance (the  Charter Amendment ). As a result of the Charter Amendment, as of October 19, 2007, we had adequate
shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock. 

On December 19, 2007, the holders of all the
issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of their shares into shares of Common Stock. As
a result, the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for 7,407,540 shares of Common Stock, and all 500
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of undesignated preferred
stock, par value $.001 per shares. 

On August 15, 2008 (the  Series A Preferred
Elimination Date ), all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued
shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of
the Series A Preferred Elimination Date. 

On August 29, 2008 (the  Reverse Split
Effective Date ), we implemented a 1 for 50 reverse stock split (the  Reverse Split ) of the Common Stock. Pursuant
to the Reverse Split, each 50 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Reverse Split Effective Date was converted
into one (1) share of Common Stock. All share and per share data herein has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse
Split. 

In December 2008, we sold 550,000 shares of
Common Stock to Kirk Warshaw, our CFO, for $2,000. We determined such shares were issued below their fair value; hence $11,750
of compensation expense was recorded for the difference in value of the shares issued for cash versus fair value of such shares. 

On May 6, 2013, Ironbound Partners Fund, LLC
( Ironbound ) acquired 9,509,440 shares of Common Stock (the  Acquired Shares ) for an aggregate purchase
price of $15,000, or $0.00157737 per share. The Acquired Shares represent 69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock. The Acquired Shares were purchased by Ironbound, utilizing its available and uncommitted cash, from the Chapter 7 Trustee
of the Estates of Rodman   Renshaw, LLC ( Rodman ), Direct Markets, Inc., and Direct Markets Holdings, Corp. in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No.
13-10087, 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constitute all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R R, an
affiliate of Rodman. 

On May 14, 2013, Ironbound loan $100,000 to
us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 to Ironbound (the  May 2013 Note ).
The May 2013 Note is for a two-year term and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and
accrued interest on the May 2013 Note is convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a  Fundamental
Transaction  (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined in the May 2013 Note). 

On August 15, 2013, we declared a stock dividend
on our outstanding Common Stock for stockholders of record as of August 15, 2013 (the  Record Date ). As a result,
all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock owned by them as of
the that date (the  2013 Stock Dividend ). All share and per share data herein has been retroactively restated to reflect
the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock Dividend, since the 2013 Stock Dividend was in substance a forward stock split. 

On July 25, 2014, we raised gross proceeds
of $72,000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and, in connection therewith, issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory
note (the  2014 Note ) in the principal amount of $72,000. The 2014 Note had a maturity date of August 31, 2015 (amended
as described below) and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on
the 2014 Note is convertible, at the election of Ironbound, into shares of our common stock following the consummation of a  Qualified
Financing  (as defined in the 2014 Note), or upon the consummation of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined
in the 2014 Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined in the 2014 Note). 

Further, on July 25, 2014, we issued an amended
and restated convertible promissory note (the  Amended and Restated Note ) to Ironbound in the principal amount of
$100,000, in substitution for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August
31, 2015 (amended as described below) and provides for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible,
at the election of Ironbound, into shares of our common stock following the consummation of a  Qualified Financing 
(as defined in the May 2013 Note), or upon the consummation of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined in the May 2013
Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note otherwise remains unchanged. 

Effective September 1, 2015, the maturity dates
of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31, 2015 to August 31, 2016. 

On October 30, 2015, Mr. Kling resigned from
his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October 30, 2015, Mr. Warshaw resigned from his
positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling s and Warshaw s resignation were not due to any
disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company s operations, policies or practices.
Prior to Mr. Kling s resignation, our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky, the managing member of Ironbound,
our largest stockholder, to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling s resignation and will assume the role of President of
the Company. 

On April 1, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory
note (the  2016 Note  and together with the Prior Notes, the  Outstanding Notes ) in the principal amount
of $10,000 to Ironbound. The 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the 2016 Note was and will be utilized
by the Company to fund working capital needs. 

On July 15, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory
note (the  July 2016 Note ) in the principal amount of $25,000 to Ironbound Partners Fund, LLC. The July 2016 Note
has a maturity date of August 31, 2017 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and
accrued interest on the July 2016 Note is convertible, at the election of Ironbound, into shares of the Company s common
stock following the consummation of a  Qualified Financing  (as defined in the July 2016 Note), or upon the consummation
of a  Fundamental Transaction  (as defined in the July 2016 Note) at the  Conversion Price  (as defined
in the July 2016 Note). The proceeds of the July 2016 Note will be utilized by the Company to fund working capital needs. 

Effective September 1, 2016, the maturity
date of the Outstanding Notes was extended from August 31, 2016 to August 31, 2017. 

As of September 30, 2016, our authorized capital
stock consisted of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock of which 13,757,550 shares of Common
Stock, and no shares of Preferred Stock, were issued and outstanding. All shares of Common Stock currently outstanding are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 

As of the Effective Date, we discontinued our
efforts to promote the Dreesen's Donut Brand, we have no employees and our main purpose has been to effect a business combination
with an operating business which we believe has significant growth potential. As of yet, we have no definitive agreements or understandings
with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which
to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful
sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank
and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe
has significant growth potential. While we may, under certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than
one target business, unless and until additional financing is obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an
initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations. 

A common reason for a target company to enter
into a merger with us is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the
perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself, such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred
to comply with the various Federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings. 

As a result of our limited resources, we expect
to have sufficient proceeds to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly, the prospects for our success will be entirely
dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several
business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry, we will not have
the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business
may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services, in
which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable. 

Our officers are only required to devote a
small portion of their time (less than 10%) to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. We expect to use outside consultants,
advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we are seeking
and evaluating business opportunities. 

We expect our present management to play no
managerial role in our company following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize closely the management of a prospective
target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a target business, our assessment of management
may be incorrect. We cannot assure you that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. 

Our principal business objective for the next
12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating business.
We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and,
thus, may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision
of our officers and directors. 

Results of Operations  

THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE
MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

We are a corporation with limited operations
and did not have any revenues during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Total expenses from continuing operations for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $20,810 and $13,668, respectively. The majority of these expenses primarily
constituted general and administrative expenses related to accounting and compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended ( Exchange Act ). 

SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE SIX
MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

We are a corporation with limited operations
and did not have any revenues during the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Total expenses from continuing operations for
the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $35,053 and $30,400, respectively. The majority of these expenses primarily
constituted general and administrative expenses related to accounting and compliance with the Exchange Act. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At September 30, 2016, we did not have any
revenues from operations. Absent a merger or other combination with an operating company, we do not expect to have any revenues
from operations. No assurance can be given that such a merger or other combination will occur or that we can engage in any public
or private sales of our equity or debt securities to raise working capital. We are dependent upon future loans or capital contributions
from our present stockholders and/or management and there can be no assurances that our present stockholders or management will
make any loans or capital contributions to us. 

At September 30, 2016, we had the Outstanding
Notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $217,000 payable to Ironbound, our majority stockholder. We had cash and cash
equivalents of $9,555 and negative working capital of $234,796. Such funds will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements
during the next twelve months and we will require additional funds. We cannot provide assurance that adequate additional funds
will be available or, if available, will be offered on acceptable terms. 

Our present material commitments are professional
and administrative fees and expenses associated with the preparation of our filings with the SEC and other regulatory requirements.
In the event that we engage in any merger or other combination with an operating company, we will have additional material professional
commitments. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our unaudited financial statements are prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in such financial statements and related notes. Actual
results can and will differ from estimates. These differences could be material to the financial statements. We believe our application
of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable. Outlined below are those policies considered particularly
significant. 

Use of Estimates  

In preparing financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, management makes certain estimates and assumptions, where applicable, that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ from those estimates, management
does not expect such variances, if any, to have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Income Taxes  

The asset and liability method is used in accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless
it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. 

Financial Instruments  

The estimated fair values of all reported assets
and liabilities which represent financial instruments, none of which are held for trading purposes, approximate their carrying
value because of the short term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. 

Equity Based Compensation  

The accounting guidance for  Share Based
Payments  requires the recognition of the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards and applies to all outstanding
and vested stock-based awards. In computing the impact, the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on
the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility; and expected remaining
lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management s
best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if
factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
In estimating our forfeiture rate, we analyzed its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options, and the
amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from
its estimate, or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly
different from what we have recorded in the current period. The last equity based compensation issued by us was more than two years
ago and such shares were fully vested upon issuance, hence an expense was recorded at that time. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-12,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period .  The amendments in
this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide
that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that
a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that
affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim
periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. The effective date is the
same for both public business entities and all other entities. 

Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either (a) prospectively
to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are
outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified
awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this ASU as of the beginning of the
earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings
balance at that date. Additionally, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing
the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15
on  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . Currently, there is no guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related
footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity
in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue
as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically,
the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including
interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain
disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for
public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. 

All other new accounting pronouncements issued
but not yet effective have been reviewed and determined to be not applicable. As a result, the adoption of such new accounting
pronouncements, when effective, is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position. 

Commitments  

We do not have any commitments which are required
to be disclosed in tabular form as of September 30, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements such as guarantees, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred, obligation under a derivative instrument
and obligation arising out of or a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

As a smaller reporting company, we are not
required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
Our management, with the participation of our president and our chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in the Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of
the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, our president and
our chief financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our president and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.  There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered
by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
