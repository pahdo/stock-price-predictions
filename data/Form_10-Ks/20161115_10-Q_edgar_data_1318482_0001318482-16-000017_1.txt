Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Nine Months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 
 (Unaudited) 

1.         Basis of Presentation:   
 
The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared by Shoal Games Ltd. ("the Company") in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US
GAAP") applicable to interim financial information and with the rules and
regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed, or omitted, pursuant to such rules
and regulations.  In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for the fair
presentation of the results of the interim periods presented.  All adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise noted below.  These
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed March 17, 2016, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period
or for a full fiscal year.  
  
Continuing operations  
 
These unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going
concern basis, which presumes the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities in the normal course of operations.  The application of the going
concern basis is dependent upon the Company achieving profitable operations to
generate sufficient cash flows to fund continued operations, or, in the absence
of adequate cash flows from operations, obtaining additional financing.  The
Company has reported losses from operations for the quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and has an accumulated deficit of $20,818,070 as at September 30,
2016.  This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. 
 
In view of the
matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion
of the recorded asset amounts and settlement of the liability amounts shown in
the accompanying balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the
Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to succeed in its
future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue in existence. 
 
Management
continues to review operations in order to identify additional strategies
designed to generate cash flow, improve the Company's financial position, and
enable the timely discharge of the Company's obligations.  If management is
unable to identify sources of additional cash flow in the short term, it may be
required to further reduce or limit operations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Nine Months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 
 (Unaudited) 

2.         Summary of
significant accounting policies:  
 
(a)
  Basis of
presentation: 
 
These consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") applicable to
annual financial information and with the rules and regulations of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial statements include the
accounts of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Shoal Media (Canada) Inc. (registered in
British Columbia, Canada), Coral Reef Marketing Inc. (registered in Anguilla),
Bingo.com (Antigua) Inc., Bingo.com (Wyoming) Inc., Bingo Acquisition Corp,
Shoal Media Inc. (registered in Anguilla), and the 99% owned subsidiary, Shoal
Games (UK) Plc (registered in the United Kingdom). During the quarter ended
March 31, 2016, English Bay Office Management Limited changed its name to Shoal
Media (Canada) Inc. Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2016, Rooplay
Media Ltd. was registered in British Columbia, Canada. All inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements. 
 
(b)
  Use of estimates: 
 
The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and recognized revenues and expenses for
the reporting periods.  
 
Significant areas
requiring the use of estimates include the valuation of long-lived assets, the
collectibility of accounts receivable and the valuation of deferred tax assets. 
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. 
 
(c)
  
Revenue
recognition: 
 
Trophy Bingo revenues have been recognized from the sale of in-game purchases,
net of platform fees, at the time of purchase by the player. The revenue from
in-game advertising is recognized when advertising is served to the player. 
 
Advertising revenues, not generated in Trophy Bingo, have been recognized when
collection of the amounts are reasonably assured.  
 
(d)
  Foreign currency: 
 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars,
the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company
accounts for foreign currency transactions and the translation of foreign
currency financial statements under Statement ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
Transaction amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Carrying values of monetary
assets and liabilities are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the
exchange rate at that date.

2.         Summary of
significant accounting policies: (Continued)  
 
(d)
  Foreign currency: (Continued) 
 
Non-monetary
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the original
transaction date.  
 
Gains and losses from restatement of foreign currency
monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities are included in net income.
Revenues and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the
dates such items are recognized in earnings.  
 
(e)   Impairment
of long-lived assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of:  
 
The
Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC
360, Property, Plant and Equipment and ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Others.
During the periods presented, the only long-lived assets reported on the
Company's consolidated balance sheet are equipment, other assets, and security
deposits.  These provisions require that long-lived assets and certain
identifiable recorded intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. 
 
If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. 
 
(g)   Software
Development Costs: 
 
Software
development costs incurred in the research and development of new software
products and enhancements to existing software products for external use are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. After
technological feasibility is established, any software development costs are
capitalized and amortized at the greater of the straight-line basis over the
estimated economic life of the related product or the ratio that current gross
revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross
revenues for the related product. Commencing January 1, 2014, the Company
obtained technological feasibility and is amortizing the capitalized software
development costs over a period of 3 years. The Company performs an annual
review of the estimated economic life and the recoverability of such capitalized
software costs, using a net realizable value test.  
 
If a determination
is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash
flows to be generated from the applicable software, any remaining capitalized
amounts are written off. Although the Company believes that its approach to
estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could
differ and the Company may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that
could be material.  Total software development costs for the development of
Trophy and Garfield's Bingo were $4,713,621 as at September 30, 2016 (September
30, 2015 - $3,562,236).

2.         Summary of
significant accounting policies: (Continued)  
 
(h)   New
accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policy: 
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers and issued subsequent amendments to the
initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016 within ASU
2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12, respectively.
The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the
Codification. Additionally, this update supersedes some cost guidance included
in ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type
Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain
or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a
customer (for example, assets within the scope of ASC 360, Property, Plant, and
Equipment, and intangible assets, within the scope of ASC 350, Intangibles -
Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on
recognition and measurement in this update. The standard was to be effective for
the Company as of January 1, 2017, but in August 2015, the FASB delayed the
effective date of the new revenue accounting standard to January 1, 2019, and
would permit early adoption as of the original effective date. Earlier adoption
is not otherwise permitted for public entities. An entity can apply the revenue
standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full
retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially
applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application in retained
earnings (simplified transition method). The Company is currently assessing the
impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. The Company has
not yet selected an adoption date, a transition method nor has it determined the
effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  
 
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,
Compensation-Stock Compensation. This guidance requires that a performance
target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite
service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance
target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the
award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized
in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be
achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods
for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The new standard is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2015 and can be applied either prospectively or
retrospectively to all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest
annual period presented as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Early
adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have a material
impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about

management's responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going
concern and sets rules for how this information should be disclosed in the
financial statements. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the effect of ASU 2014-15 on our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations. 
 
In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-16, Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument
Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity. This standard
requires an entity to "determine the nature of the host contract by considering
all stated and implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial
instrument, weighing each term and feature on the basis of the relevant facts
and circumstances which the hybrid financial instrument was issued or acquired
and the potential outcome of the hybrid financial instrument.  ASU 2014-16 is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015 and interim periods
thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 did not
have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. 
 
In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,
which eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. If an event or
transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, it is
segregated from the results of ordinary operations and is shown as a separate
item in the income statement, net of tax. ASU 2015-01 is effective for annual
periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.
The adoption of ASU 2015-01 did not have a
material impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,
which provides guidance for reporting entities that are required to evaluate
whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In accordance with ASU
2015-02, all legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised
consolidation model. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for
annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did
not have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. 
 
On April 1, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the
effective date of ASU No. 2014-09, which outlines a single comprehensive model
for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with
customers and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception.
Public business entities may elect to adopt the amendments as of the original
effective date; however, if the proposed deferral is approved, adoption is
required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are
currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.

On April 17, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires
debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the associated debt liability.  Currently, debt issuance costs are recorded
as an asset and amortization of these deferred financing costs is recorded in
interest expense.  Under the new standard, debt issuance costs will continue to
be amortized over the life of the debt instrument and amortization will continue
to be recorded in interest expense.  The new standard is effective for the
Company on January 1, 2016 and will be applied on a retrospective basis.  The
adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
The FASB has issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles -
Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.  The amendments in
ASU 2015-05 provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software
license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other
software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software
license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.
The amendments do not change the accounting for a customer's accounting for
service contracts. As a result of the amendments, all software licenses within
the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other
licenses of intangible assets.  ASU 2015-05 is effective for public entities for
annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material
impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments guidance to
simplify the accounting for adjustments in a business combination. An acquirer
should recognize adjustments to provisional amounts with a corresponding
adjustment of goodwill, as well as the effect on earnings of changes in
depreciation, amortization or other income effects, in the reporting period in
which the adjustments are identified as if the accounting had been completed at
the acquisition date. Disclosure is required, by line item, of the amount
recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous
reporting periods. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and requires prospective application.
Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material
impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
 
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which
requires deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as
noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and

2.         Summary of
significant accounting policies: (Continued)  
 
(h)   New
accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policy: (Continued) 
 
noncurrent. The guidance is effective for public
entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods with early adoption being permitted. The
Company is still assessing the potential impact of ASU 2015-17 on its
consolidated financial statements. 
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("ASU 2016-01"), which requires that
equity investments, except for those accounted for under the equity method or
those that result in consolidation of the investee, be measured at fair value,
with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an
entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily
determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the
identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. ASU 2016-01 also impacts
the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU
2016-01 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, and
interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.
Early adoption is permitted only for certain provisions. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements. 
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize most leases on
the balance sheet. This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset
and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Lessees
are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset
and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. The ASU does not
significantly change the lessees' recognition, measurement and presentation of
expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard. Lessors'
accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from the previous accounting
standard. In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease
arrangements. Lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition
approach, which includes a number of practical expedients. The provisions of
this guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
Management is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet
determined the impact of the adoption on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

2.         Summary of
significant accounting policies: (Continued)  
 
(h)   New
accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policy: (Continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"), which
addresses how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to
employees. Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of
awards in the statement of income when the awards vest or are settled, and to
present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash
flows rather than as a financing activity. The ASU also addresses such areas as
an accounting policy election for forfeitures and the amount an employer can
withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification. The
amendments in this ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments". The accounting standard changes the methodology for
measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing when such losses
are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU
No. 2016-13 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,
"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)". The new guidance is intended to reduce
diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the
statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the
same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition
method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-15 on its
financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The
standard improves the accounting for income tax consequences of intra-entry
transfers of assets other than inventory. This pronouncement is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in
this ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-16 on its financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.

2.         Summary of
significant accounting policies: (Continued)  
 
(h)   New
accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policy: (Continued) 
 
There have been no other recent accounting
standards, or changes in accounting standards, during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to the recent accounting standards described in
the Annual Report, that are of material significance, or have potential material
significance, to us. 
 
 (i)   Financial
instruments:  
 
(i)  Fair values: 
 
The fair value of accounts receivable,
accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accounts payable and accrued
liabilities - related party approximate their financial statement carrying
amounts due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.  Cash is carried
at fair value using a level 1 fair value measurement. 
 
In
general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values
determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as
quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level
3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and included

situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset.  The
Company's cash was measured using Level 1 inputs. 
 
(ii) 
Foreign currency risk: 
 
The
Company operates internationally, which gives rise to the risk that cash flows
may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.  The Company has not
entered into any forward exchange contracts or other derivative instrument to
hedge against foreign exchange risk. 
 
 3. Prepaid expenses  
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company

has $35,266 of prepaid legal fees for the rights issue. The Company has other
prepaid expenses of $22,833 as at September 30, 2016.

 8.   Income Taxes:  
 
Shoal Games Ltd. is domiciled

The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2016, and December 31,
2015, are presented below: 

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those differences become deductible. 
 Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax
planning strategies in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.

exposure with any one institution.  
 
The Company currently maintains a substantial
portion of its day-to-day operating cash balances at financial institutions. At

  OVERVIEW  
 
Shoal Games Ltd. (the  Company )
develops, markets, and publishes Trophy
Bingo, Garfield's Bingo, and Rooplay.  Trophy Bingo is an innovative
free-to-play mobile game live in the Apple, Google and Amazon App Stores. 
Trophy Bingo brings unique gameplay and industry leading monetization techniques
to the bingo category which is both high growth and high value.  The game is
free to download and supports in-app purchases and in-game advertising for
players who want to engage with the premium features contained in the game. 
In-game purchases are transactions made from within a mobile game that are
processed by the platform provider (Apple iOS; Google Android; Amazon Android). 
The worldwide full launch and marketing of Trophy Bingo commenced in the third
quarter of 2015 when the latest version of Trophy Bingo was released world-wide
in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store on all supported mobile phones and
tablet devices. 
 The Company
generates its main source of revenue from players making in-app purchases in
Trophy Bingo via the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store and the Amazon
Store. An additional source of revenue comes from serving advertising to our
user demographic inside the Trophy Bingo game.  Through relationships we have
with advertising aggregators and providers, companies pay to have their products
and services promoted in our App. 
 Upon
obtaining the license to Garfield's Bingo in late April 2016, the Company
reviewed its software development and player acquisition strategies.  Upon
completion of the review and relevant modeling, and in light of the delays
occurred in completing it's private placement funding, the Company decided to
significantly reduce its player acquisition cost of marketing with Trophy Bingo
to preserve capital and to increase its development resources dedicated to
improving the play mechanics of the Trophy Bingo platform while simultaneously
building out Garfield's Bingo utilizing the same platform and game mechanics 
but with a different story line and digital art focused on maximizing the power
of the Garfield brand worldwide, including Asia. Subsequent to the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, Garfield's Bingo was soft launched in selected test countries
and is projected for world wide launch in early December. 
 Additionally,
upon acquiring in quarter ended September 30, 2016, a world-wide license to
Rooplay, an innovative platform streaming technology under development, the
Company immediately commenced work in conjunction with the Rooplay developers on
completing a commercially available prototype for introduction in the Google
Play store in early December.  Rooplay provides curated games for children under
a subscription based, recurring revenue business model. 
 Prior to
December 31, 2014 the Company provided a variety of Internet games plus other
forms of entertainment, including an online community, chat rooms, and more.
This portion of the business was sold to Unibet, plc on December 31, 2014 and
can be viewed at www.bingo.com. 
 
We conducted a beta test launch of Trophy Bingo in May 2013, followed by a
global soft launch of the enhanced game on Android in August, 2014 and on iOS in
September 2014.  Trophy Bingo was released worldwide in the Google Play Store on
August 12, 2015, in the Apple App Store on September 3, 2015, and in the Amazon
Appstore on November 30, 2015. 
 On December
31, 2014, we sold the gambling business and the bingo.com domain name to Unibet
Group plc, and focused the business on the development and marketing of our
innovative social bingo game, Trophy Bingo.  During the year ended December 31,
2015, the Company changed its name to Shoal Games Ltd.   
 
We have made a significant investment in the
development of Trophy Bingo, and previously in our Internet games plus other
forms of entertainment, including an online community, chat rooms, and more.  As
a result we have incurred significant losses since inception, and as of
September 30, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $20,818,070.

Effective July 2, 2015, the Company commenced
trading on the TSX Venture Exchange as a tier 2 Technology Issuer under the
trading symbol "SGW".  The Company also trades on the OTCQB under the trading
symbol "SGLDF".   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements,
which except for lack of all detailed note disclosures, have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, management evaluates these judgments and estimates, including
whether there are any uncertainties as to compliance with the revenue
recognition criteria described below, and recoverability of long-lived assets,
as well as the assessment as to whether there are contingent assets and
liabilities that should be recognized or disclosed for the consolidated
financial statements to fairly present the information required to be set forth
therein. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 
 
We consider the following accounting policies to
be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
require the most subjective judgment:  
 
- Revenue recognition;   
 
- Software development 
  
Revenue recognition:  
 
Trophy Bingo revenues have been recognized from the sale of in-game purchases,
net of platform fees, at the time of purchase by the player. The revenue from
in-game advertising is recognized when advertising is served to the player. 
 
Advertising revenues, not generated in Trophy Bingo, have been recognized when
collection of the amounts are reasonably assured.  
  
Software
Development Costs:    
 
Software development costs incurred in the research and development of new
software products and enhancements to existing software products for external
use are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been
established. After technological feasibility is established, any software
development costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated economic life of the related product. The Company performs an
annual review of the estimated economic life and the recoverability of such
capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts
are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the
applicable software, any remaining capitalized amounts are written off.  The
Company capitalized 100% of its development costs of Trophy Bingo in 2013.
Commencing January 1, 2014, the Company
commenced amortizing the capitalized software development costs over a period of
3 years and all further development costs have been expensed. The Company
performs an annual review of the estimated economic life and the recoverability
of such capitalized software costs, using a net realizable value test. 
 If a
determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the
estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software, any remaining
capitalized amounts are written off. Although the Company believes that its
approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual
results could differ and the Company may be exposed to increases or decreases in
revenue that could be material.  The
Company capitalized 100% its development costs of Trophy Bingo in 2013.
Commencing January 1, 2014, the Company
commenced amortizing the capitalized software
  
 Page 22 
 development costs over a period of
3 years and all further development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Although the Company believes that its approach to estimates and judgments as
described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and the Company may
be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.  Total
software development costs for the development of Trophy and Garfield's Bingo were
$4,713,621 as at September 30, 2016 (September 30, 2015 - $3,562,236).  
 Page 23 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 
             Revenue  
 
Total revenue from continuing operations for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, increased to $52,758, an increase of 374% from
revenue from continuing operations of $11,130 for third quarter of 2015 and a
decrease of 32% from revenue of $77,821, in the second quarter of 2016. The
increase in total revenue compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, is due
to the Company launching a full global
release of a feature complete Trophy Bingo
in the Google Play and Apple App Store in the latter half of the third quarter
of fiscal 2015 and an increase in players playing Trophy Bingo. The decrease in
total revenue compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to lower
marketing spend whilst the Company completes the development of additional
features for Trophy Bingo and finalizes the development of Garfield's Bingo. In addition,
the Company is preparing for the world wide launch of Garfield's Bingo in Q4,
2016.  
 
             Sales and marketing expenses  
 
Sales and marketing expenses from continuing
operations were $26,044 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of
81% over expenses of $137,266 in the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 84%
from sales and marketing expenses of $166,758 in the second quarter of 2016.
This decrease in sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations in the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015
and the second quarter of fiscal 2016, was due to a lower marketing spend for
player acquisitions in Trophy Bingo whilst the Company prepares for the launch
of planned new features in Trophy Bingo to meet active player demand and to
complete the development of Garfield's Bingo. In addition, the Company is
preparing for the launch of Garfield's Bingo in Q4 2016.  Selling and marketing
expenses from continuing operations principally include publishing services and
user acquisition costs to acquire players. 
 
We expect to continue to incur sales and
marketing expenses to increase traffic and bring new players to the Trophy Bingo
and Garfield's Bingo game and Rooplay in Q1 2017. There can be no assurances
that these expenditures will result in increased traffic or significant
additional revenue. 
 
             General and administrative
expenses  
 
General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of premises costs for our office, legal and professional fees, and
other general corporate and office expenses. General and administrative expenses
decreased to $65,601 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 17%
from costs of $79,398 for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and an increase of
91% from costs of $34,410 in the second quarter of 2016. Effective July 2, 2015,
the Company commenced trading on the TSX
Venture Exchange as a tier 2 Technology Issuer under the trading symbol "SGW.
This decrease in general and
administrative expenses compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, is due to
the fees incurred in listing the Company in the third quarter of 2015. The
increase in general and administrative expenses compared to the second quarter
of fiscal 2016, is due to hiring the staff to develop Trophy Bingo and Garfield's
Bingo directly from Roadhouse Interactive Limited and establishing the new
office for the new employees to work within. 
 
We expect to continue to incur general and
administrative expenses to support the business, and there can be no assurances
that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to cover these expenses. 
  
Salaries, wages, consultants and benefits  
 
Salaries, wages, consultants and benefits
decreased to $97,626 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 9%
compared to salaries, wages, consultants and benefits of $107,633 in the third
quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 8%, over salaries, wages, consultants and
benefits of $105,887 in the second quarter of 2016. This decrease compared to
the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of   
 Page 24 
 
fiscal 2016, is due
to lower consultant charges incurred. The salaries, wages, consultants expenses
related to the development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay are
expensed under development costs.  
 
 Depreciation and amortization  
 
Equipment is depreciated using the declining
balance method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to five
years. Depreciation and amortization decreased to $501 during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of 34% over costs of $763 during the same quarter
in the prior year and equal to costs of $500 in the second quarter of 2016. This
decrease in depreciation and amortization compared to the third quarter of
fiscal 2015 is due to the aging of the Company's equipment and the disposal of
obsolete equipment. 
  
Trophy Bingo development and amortization  
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Company soft-launched Trophy Bingo
on Android in selected markets. The Company had a further global release of the
Andriod version in the third quarter of 2014 and the iOS version in the second
quarter of 2014. The Company ceased to capitalize the development of Trophy
Bingo and commenced amortizing the capitalized development costs over the life
of the game. The Company expensed $387,068 in development costs during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 and amortized $120,503 of the capitalized
development costs during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This compares to
$303,162 expensed development costs during the third quarter of 2015 and
amortization of $120,503 of the capitalized development costs during the third
quarter of 2015 and $251,534 expensed development costs during the second
quarter of 2016 and amortization of $120,504 of the capitalized development
costs during the second quarter of 2016. This increase of 28% in development
costs compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is due the increase of
development expenses incurred in the development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo
and Rooplay. The increase of 54% in development costs compared to the second
quarter of fiscal 2016 is due the increase of development expenses incurred in
the development of new features for Trophy Bingo and the commencement of
development of Garfield's Bingo in the second quarter of 2016 and the
commencement of the development of Rooplay in the third quarter of 2016. 
 
In particular, the games contains systems for
handling daily rewards, collections, gifting, an advanced spin wheel plus
special events.  Each of these features affects a particular performance
statistic within the game and in combination it's expected that average
retention and monetization will rise, while the average player acquisition cost
(the average cost to generate one new install of the game) will fall.  Daily
rewards help to improve retention as players are inspired to come back to
collect rewards.  Whereas the collection and gifting system is designed to
increase virality (reducing acquisition costs) and monetization as players
interact more with their friends and spend more in-game currency trying to
collect the special items. 
  
            Loss on prepaid development  
 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the
Company prepaid $863,660 in development costs. Effective August 31, 2016,
Roadhouse Interactive Limited was placed in receivership. There was $498,791 in
development expenses which had not been utilized. The Company immediately
expensed this.  
 
             Net loss and loss per share  
 
The net loss after taxation from continuing
operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, amounted to ($1,156,098), a
loss of ($0.02) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of
($758,611) or ($0.01) per share in the quarter ending June 30, 2015 and net loss
from continuing operations of ($620,968), or ($0.01) per share in the second
quarter of fiscal 2016.    
 Page 25 
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 
We had cash of $82,417 and working capital
deficit of ($59,119) at September 30, 2016.  This compares to cash of $570,086
and working capital of $454,447 at December 31, 2015. 
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we used cash of ($126,625) in
operating activities compared to cash used in operating activities of ($538,667)
in the same period in the prior year and compared to using cash of ($1,477,535)
in the second quarter of 2016.  
 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash of ($2,022,550) in
operating activities compared to using cash in operating activities of
($1,580,357) in the same period in the prior year.  
 Our future
capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including costs
associated with the further development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo and
Rooplay, the cost of marketing and player acquisition costs for Trophy Bingo,
Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay, the costs of a world wide launch of Garfield's
Bingo and Rooplay and the success and acceptance of both Trophy Bingo,
Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay, plus the continuing upkeep of our Web portals

www.shoalgames.com 
and 

www.trophybingo.com 
and www.rooplay.com. 
  ITEM 4           Controls and Procedures  
  
(a)        Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures.  
 
As required by Rule 13a-15 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the
Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company's management, including the President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. In
designing and evaluating the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, the
Company and its management recognize that there are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls
and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control
objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and
procedures, the Company's management was required to apply its reasonable
judgment. Furthermore, in the course of this evaluation, management considered
certain internal control areas, in which we have made and are continuing to make
changes to improve and enhance controls. Based upon the required evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of
September 30, 2016, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective (at the  reasonable assurance  level mentioned above) to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and forms. 
 
From time-to-time, the Company and its management have conducted and will
continue to conduct further reviews and, from time to time put in place
additional documentation, of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures,
as well as its internal control over financial reporting. The Company may from
time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness, as well as
changes aimed at ensuring that the Company's systems evolve with, and meet the
needs of, the Company's business. These changes may include changes necessary or
desirable to address recommendations of the Company's management, its counsel
and/or its independent auditors, including any recommendations of its
independent auditors arising out of their audits and reviews of the Company's
financial statements. These changes may include changes to the Company's own
systems, as well as to the systems of businesses that the Company has acquired
or that the Company may acquire in the future and will, if made, be intended to
enhance the  
 
 Page 26 
 
effectiveness of the Company's controls and procedures. The Company is also
continually striving to improve its management and operational efficiency and
the Company expects that its efforts in that regard will from time to time
directly or indirectly affect the Company's disclosure controls and procedures,
as well as the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  
  (b)        Changes in
internal controls.  
 
There were no significant changes
in the Company's internal controls or other factors that could significantly
affect the Company's internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation.
