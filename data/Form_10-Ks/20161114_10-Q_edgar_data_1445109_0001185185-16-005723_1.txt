ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. ( Clean Coal ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in Clean Coal s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any future period. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the Form 10K have been omitted.

Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed similar to basic net income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

During 2015, all common stock equivalents were excluded as they would have been anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the dilutive effect of the outstanding common stock options was 0 shares, common stock warrants was 1,929,813 shares, the dilutive effect of the outstanding warrant conversion options was 27,553,046 shares and the dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible debt was 78,643,882 shares, with a reduction to net income of $57,529,457. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the dilutive effect of the outstanding common stock options was 0 shares, common stock warrants was 1,347,259 shares, the dilutive effect of the outstanding warrant conversion options was 20,476,600 shares and the dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible debt was 78,389,279 shares, with a reduction to net income of $20,464,270.

NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, liabilities, and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Clean Coal is unable to continue as a going concern. Clean Coal has an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016 with no significant revenues anticipated for the near term. Management believes Clean Coal will need to raise capital in order to operate over the next 12 months. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Clean Coal has also incurred significant losses since inception. Clean Coal s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Clean Coal has limited capital with which to pursue its business plan. There can be no assurance that Clean Coal s future operations will be significant and profitable, or that Clean Coal will have sufficient resources to meet its objectives. These conditions may raise doubt as to Clean Coal s ability to continue as a going concern. Management may pursue either debt or equity financing or a combination of both, in order to raise sufficient capital to meet Clean Coal s financial requirements over the next twelve months and to fund its business plan. There is no assurance that management will be successful in raising additional funds.

NOTE 3: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Research and development consists of costs incurred related to the construction and testing of a 2-ton/hour test plant in Oklahoma. The estimated cost of moving the test facility to a permanent location and have it reassembled is $750,000. In quarter four 2015, the test plant was commissioned and testing of the plant started. Testing was successfully completed in April 2016 and the company is currently arranging for the plant to be moved to a permanent location. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $1,495,348 and $0 in research and development expenses, respectively.

The Company estimated the fair value of the derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following key assumptions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016

The Company determines the fair market values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The Company uses Level 3 inputs to estimate the fair value of its derivative liabilities.

The following table sets forth by level with the fair value hierarchy the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements concerning: our plans, strategies and objectives for future operations; new products or developments; future economic conditions, performance or outlook; the outcome of contingencies; expected cash flows or capital expenditures; our beliefs or expectations; activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future; and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of forward-looking terminology, such as  believes,   expects,   may,   should,   would,   will,   intends,   plans,   estimates,   anticipates,   projects  and similar words or expressions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our management s opinions only as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are not guarantees of future performance or actual results

Overview

Over the past decade, Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. has developed processes that address what we believe are the key technology priorities of the global coal industry. We currently have three processes in our intellectual property portfolio:

The original process, called Pristine, is designed to remove moisture and volatile matter, rendering a high-efficiency, cleaner thermal coal.  The process has been tested successfully on bituminous and subbituminous coals, and lignite from various parts of the United States and from numerous countries around the world.

Our second process, called Pristine-M, is a low-cost coal dehydration technology. In tests, this process has succeeded in drying coal cheaply and stabilizing it using volatile matter released by the feed coal. Our coal testing plant has now been constructed and the testing has been successfully been completed at the test facility at the AES coal power utility in Oklahoma.

Our third process, called Pristine-SA, is designed to eliminate 100% of the volatile matter in the feed coal and to achieve stable combustion by co-firing it with biomass or natural gas.  The idea is to produce a clean fuel that eliminates the need for emissions scrubbers and the corollary production of toxic coal ash.  We anticipate that treated coal that is co-fired with other energy resources will burn as clean as natural gas.

Anticipated Benefits of the Technology:

Reduction of undesired emissions and greenhouse gases through the removal of compounds that are not required for combustion in conventional boilers.

Cost savings and environmental impact reduction. Our pre-combustion solution is anticipated to be much less expensive than post-combustion solutions such as emissions scrubbers.  Not only are the latter prohibitively expensive, they produce coal ash containing the  scrubbed  compounds, which is dumped in toxic waste disposal sites where it may pose continuing environmental risk.  Coal treated using our processes may eliminate the need for post-combustion emissions scrubbers and the resulting toxic ash.

Potential use of compounds removed from treated coal. Volatile matter captured in the Pristine process is removed in the form of hydrocarbon liquids that we believe will be easily blended with crude oil or used as feedstock for various products.  For example, sulfur, which can be removed using the Pristine process, is a basic feedstock for fertilizer.  The harvesting of hydrocarbon liquids from abundant, cheap coal is a potentially lucrative side benefit of our processes.

Energy Independence.  To the extent that volatile matter is removed from coal, coal s use as an energy resource is greatly improved, enabling the United States and other coal-rich countries to move towards energy independence owing to coal s greater abundance.

Table of Contents 

Development Status:

Pristine process. Pristine process successfully lab tested on small scale and through advanced computer modeling. As at September 30, 2016 the key parts of this technology has also been successfully tested at the coal power utility at AES in Oklahoma. 

Pristine-M. Construction of the coal testing plant in Oklahoma was completed and testing of the plant commenced in December 2015. As at September 30, 2016 this process was successfully tested with more than 20 test runs completed. This process successfully dehydrated coal by in excess of 80% and increased the BTU output of the coal by 25%.

Pristine-SA process. Pristine SA process analysis is at a very early stage. Further research and development is expected post completion of the coal testing plant.

Business Outlook

Jindal Steel   Power expected to contract first commercial plant in the third quarter 2016. Given the successful testing the company is currently in discussions with Jindal as they review the test results

Several multinational corporations have undertaken due diligence on our processes and have visited the coal testing plant in Oklahoma and witnessed it processing coal. Discussions are underway with these corporations to move towards commercialization

Numerous discussions continuing with various domestic and international coal producers, mine operators and power plant operators about our technology and its potential application.  Several major visits are scheduled during quarter 2016 as part of the companys efforts to secure commercial agreements.

The company is working with the Department of Energy assessing specific opportunities for the deployment of our technology in the United States.

Employees

As of September 30, 2016, we had two full-time executives. President and CEO Robin Eves, Chief Operations Officer and Aiden Neary have written employment agreements. Messrs. Eves and Neary received no compensation for their participation on the Board of Directors.

Factors Affecting Results of Operations

Our operating expenses include the following:

Consulting expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid for technology development and design and engineering services;

General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and related benefits paid to our employees, as well as office and travel expenses;

Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of equipment and materials used in the development and testing of our technology; and

Legal and professional expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid for patent protections, audit, disclosure, and reporting services.

Results of Operations

The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. We have generated limited revenues from inception to date. We are also in preliminary discussions with companies, business groups, consortiums in the USA and Asia to license our technology, which, if successful, could realize limited short-term revenue opportunities from the signing of technology licensing agreements. Royalty revenue is not estimated until approximately 16 -18 months after the successful testing of the plant, currently anticipated in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and an EPC contract has been signed to build a commercial scale facility.

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

Revenues

We have generated no revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we received an initial license fee of $375,000 from Jindal paid pursuant to the signing of our coal testing plant construction contract. The balance of $375,000 will be due upon the signing of a commercial EPC agreement, anticipated in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We do not anticipate additional license revenues until the coal testing plant has been successfully tested, and do not expect to receive any royalty fees for approximately 16 to 18 months after an EPC contract has been signed to build a commercial scale facility.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $896,724 compared to $2,313,291 for the three month period in 2015. The primary component of the operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was general and administrative expenses, recognizing $896,724 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $239,485 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general administrative is mainly due to recognition $559,000 in stock compensation expense related to employee common stock awards, there were no such awards issued during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Consulting services expense were $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,073,806 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in consulting expense was mainly due to the recognition of $819,176 in stock compensation expense to consultants.

Other Income and Expenses

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized total other income of $23,050,543 compared to total other expenses of $42,637,713 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The majority of the $65,688,256 increase is due to a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $24,072,316 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $42,244,917 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partially offset by an increase of $462,583 in interest expense and the recognition of $166,394 in debt extension and standstill expense as a result of past due notes, there were no such debt extension and modification expenses in the comparable 2015 period.

Net Income/Loss

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $22,153,819, compared to a net loss of $44,951,004 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $67,104,823 increase in net income is mainly due to the increase in other income as discussed above, as well as the $1,416,567 decrease in operating expenses.

We anticipate losses from operations will increase during the next nine months due to costs associated with moving the test plant to a permanent location, as well as anticipated increased payroll expenses as we add necessary staff and increases in legal and accounting expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company. We expect that we will continue to have net losses from operations until revenues from operating facilities become sufficient to offset operating expenses, unless we are successful in the sale of licenses for our technology once the coal testing plant testing is complete.

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

Revenues

We have generated no revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we received an initial license fee of $375,000 from Jindal paid pursuant to the signing of our coal testing plant construction contract. The balance of $375,000 will be due upon the signing of a commercial EPC agreement, anticipated in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We do not anticipate additional license revenues until the coal testing plant has been successfully tested, and do not expect to receive any royalty fees for approximately 16 to 18 months after an EPC contract has been signed to build a commercial scale facility.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $9,189,738 compared to $4,064,611 for the nine month period in 2015. The primary component of the operating expenses in both periods was for shares issued for services, officers  salaries and legal fees. We recorded stock-based compensation consisting of common stock and options issued for services of $21,976 and common stock issued for officer salaries and bonus of $6,289,640 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,872,155 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses were $3,283,321 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $982,360 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative was mainly due to the recognition of stock compensation expense to officers and directors. We also recognized $1,495,348 in research and development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had no such expenses for the 2015 comparative period.

Other Income and Expenses

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized total other income of $54,713,366, compared to total other expenses of $51,966,635 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The majority of the $106,680,001 increase is due to a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $58,197,261 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $50,896,732 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partially offset by an increase of $740,792 in interest expense and the recognition of $1,673,200 in debt extension and standstill expense as a result of past due notes, there were no such debt extension and modification expenses in the comparable 2015 period.

Net Income/Loss

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $42,523,628, compared to a net loss of $56,031,246 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $101,554,874 increase in net income is mainly due to the $106,680.001 increase in other income, partially offset by the $5,125,127 increase in operating expenses, as discussed above.

We anticipate losses from operations will increase during the next nine months due to costs associated with moving the test plant to a permanent location, as well as anticipated increased payroll expenses as we add necessary staff and increases in legal and accounting expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company. We expect that we will continue to have net losses from operations until revenues from operating facilities become sufficient to offset operating expenses, unless we are successful in the sale of licenses for our technology once the coal testing plant testing is complete.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have generated minimal revenues since inception. We have obtained cash for operating expenses through advances and/or loans from affiliates and stockholders, the sale of common stock, the issuance of loans and convertible debentures 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities.  Our primary source of operating cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was borrowings on related party debt, third party debt and convertible debt.

The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at September 30, 2016.

(1)   
 
 Our New York office lease was converted to that of a satellite support office in February 2016 at a monthly rate of $200.00 per month. It is on a month to month basis.

SAIC Energy Environment   Infrastructure (SEE I), our engineering consultant has tentatively estimated construction costs for each one million short ton coal complete cleaning facility of approximately $120 million (excluding land costs) or costs for a similar size Pristine-M-only facility of approximately $45-50 million (excluding land costs). Under the terms of our consulting agreement with SEE I, we are obligated to pay to SEE I a fee representing five percent of all gross revenues received by us from the sale of our technology, the operation of franchised plants utilizing the technology, or revenue received on any other basis that is related to the technology. This fee will remain in effect for a period of 15 years, commencing from the date that we receive our initial revenue stream from operations. All intellectual property rights associated with new art developed by SEE I remain our property, however SEE I would have a  right to use  the intellectual property provided it is deployed in non-competitive projects.

Construction of the test plant in Oklahoma was completed in December 2015 and testing was completed in April 2016. For the nine months to September 30, 2016 the company paid $1,495,348 as part of the testing of the facility and is recorded in our books under Research and Development. The test plant completed commissioning and commenced testing in December 2015. Testing was successfully completed in April 2016. The company is currently arranging the move of the facility to a permanent location.

Based on our current operational costs and including the capital requirements for our project deployments, we estimate we will need a total of approximately $2,000,000 to fund the Company for the balance of fiscal year 2016 and an additional $2,000,000 to continue for the following fiscal year (2017) or until an initial commercial plant is up and running. As we have now completed the successful testing of Pristine M we are in currently working on commercial agreements which if we are successful we believe we will have sufficient funding to meet our operating costs in 2016.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on our investments but do not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to our financial condition or results of operations. We invest primarily in United States Treasury instruments with short-term (less than one year) maturities. The carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities. Under our current policies, we do not use derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates or commodity prices.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to our limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. There is a lack of appropriate segregation of duties within the Company, there is no management oversight, no control documentation being produced, and no one to review control documentation if it was being produced. As of September 30, 2016, we had two full time officers of the company.

There were no changes in disclosure controls and procedures that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our disclosure controls and procedures. We do not expect to implement any changes to our disclosure controls and procedures until there is a significant change in our operations or capital resources.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by a shareholder in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court in and for West Palm Beach County, Florida, Case No. 50 2010CA 028706XXXX MB on or about November 24, 2010. The Company has vigorously defended this action that the Company and its litigation counsel regard as absolutely frivolous, baseless and without merit. In August 2013, attorneys for the plaintiff filed a Fourth Amended Complaint. In December 2013, the Court dismissed one count of the amended complaint but plaintiff s attorneys filed a request to file a fifth amendment. In January 2014, our attorneys filed a memorandum objecting to the motion to amend. We will continue to vigorously defend the action and we do not believe that the action will be materially adverse to the company. Our attorneys have put the plaintiff s counsel on notice of our intent to seek sanctions against both the plaintiff, and the plaintiff s counsel pursuant to Florida Statute Sec.57.105. Further, we have moved to dismiss the action on the basis that the Plaintiff has procedurally, factually, and legally failed to state a cause of action up which relief can be granted.
