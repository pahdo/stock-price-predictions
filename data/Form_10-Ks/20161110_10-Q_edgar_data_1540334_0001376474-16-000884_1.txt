  Notes to the Financial Statements  
   
   1.   
   Description of the Company   
   
   Description of Development Stage Operations   
   
 Fitweiser, Inc. was incorporated on November 14, 2013 in the state of Nevada.  It completed a Share Exchange Agreement with Royal Bees Company, Inc. (Royal Bees), a Nevada corporation wherein Royal Bees exchanged approximately 83 % of its total issued and outstanding common stock for 100% of Fitweiser Inc. issued and outstanding common stock in a tax free exchange on May 28, 2014. The surviving company changed its name to Fitweiser Holdings, Inc. (the    Company   ,    We   ,    Our   ). The Company is a developing stage entity that is engaged in the development and monetization of intellectual property worldwide. The Company   s Intellectual property (IP) portfolio consist of in-process patent applications and an agreement to acquired patents covering analog and digital wireless communications and telecom, mobile technologies, security strategies and internet search and storage for business, consumer and government clientele. The Company   s patent applications are being developed internally. The company filed for three patents during the third quarter 2014. The patents were issued in the third quarter 2015. 
   
 Potential applications for our IP include dynamic, interactive and media-rich text, audio, video, and virtual content and systems delivery through landline/cable and wireless broadband, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC) and Rapidly Emerging Technologies, serving multiple industry sectors that can include portable apps used in smart device including cell phones and tablets for user-defined  and offline communications that encompasses networking, input and output permission-base and/or restricted access, authentication, activation, recognition and monitory, demographic targeting, end-user, profiling, audience capturing, aggregation, sit and/or cloud based storage and search.  
   
 The Company is exposed to a number of risks during the normal conduct of its business considering its stage in the business life cycle. These risks include, but are not limited to: (1) its ability to obtain the capital necessary to fund its operations to a point where the business can generate positive cash flows and become self-sustaining; (2) its ability to successfully protect intellectual property associated with the Company   s technology and products; and (3) its ability to attract and retain employees with the technical and other capabilities necessary to execute its business plan.

   Significant Accounting Policies   
   
   Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates in the Financial Statements    
   
 The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (   GAAP   ). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements. 
   
   Cash and cash equivalents   
   
 Cash and cash equivalents may include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value due to interest rate, market price, or penalty on withdrawal. Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty, are classified as Cash and cash equivalents. 
   
   No items of Other Comprehensive Income and Loss   
   
 The Company has no items of other comprehensive income loss for the period from November 14, 2013 (inception) to September 30, 2016. Therefore, the net loss as presented in the Company   s Statement Operations equals comprehensive loss.  
   
   Income Taxes   
   
 The Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,    Income Taxes .     The method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of other assets and liabilities. 
   
   Loss Per Share   
   
 The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10,    Earnings per Share .   Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available.  At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any potentially dilutive common shares. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) all obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability of amounts is reasonably assured. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605 Revenue Recognition and Concepts Statement 5,  Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises , paragraph 83(b) states that    an entity   s revenue-earning activities involve delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that constitute its ongoing major or central operations, and revenues are considered to have been earned when the entity has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues   .

  Notes to the Financial Statements  
   
   Intangible Assets - Patents   
   
 Patents include the cost of patents or patent rights (hereinafter, collectively    patents   ), obtained from third-parties or obtained in connection with business combinations. Capitalized patent costs are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over their remaining economic useful lives, ranging from one to ten years. Certain patent application and prosecution costs incurred to secure additional patent claims, that based on management   s estimates are deemed to be recoverable, will be capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated economic useful life of the related patent portfolio.  
   
   Intangible Assets     Short Term Note and Royal Bees Stock   
   
 As part of the Share Exchange Agreement with Royal Bees, the Company inherited a short term note for $145, 000 payable in cash no later than May 28, 2015; the annual interest is 6% and is payable at the same time the note is retired, with interest accrued monthly.  The Company sent a letter to World Ventures in June 2015 requesting an extension of the loan to June 30, 2016, with the provision that if the Company did not get a response in writing by July 31, 2015, it is the understanding of Fitweiser Holdings that the loan is extended until June 30, 2016; no response was received as of July 31, 2015. The Company sent a letter to World Ventures in June 2016 again requesting an extension of the loan to June 30, 2017, with the provision that if the Company did not get a response in writing by July 31, 2016, it is the understanding of Fitweiser Holdings that the loan is extended until June 30, 2017; no response was received as of July 31, 2016 
   
 The Company has the option to satisfy the $145, 000 payable with 725,000 shares ($0.20 per share) of post-Merger common stock of the Company.  
   
 As part of the Share Exchange Agreement with Royal Bees, the Company received 10,855,000 shares of Royal Bees stock which is valued at $0.001per share. 
   
   Impairment of Long-lived Assets.   
   
 The company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment annually (quarterly for patents) and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset   s carrying value over its fair value is recorded. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. 
   
 Fair value is generally estimated using the    Income Approach,    focusing on the estimated future net income-producing capability of the patent portfolios over the estimated remaining economic useful life. Estimates of future after-tax cash flows are converted to present value through    discounting,    including an estimated rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors. Estimated cash inflows are typically based on estimates of reasonable royalty rates for the applicable technology, applied to estimated market share data. Estimated cash outflows are based on existing contractual obligations, such as contingent legal fee and inventor royalty obligations, applied to estimated license fee revenues, in addition to other estimates of out-of-pocket expenses associated with a specific patent portfolio   s licensing and enforcement program. The analysis also contemplates consideration of current information about the patent portfolio including, status and stage of litigation, periodic results of the litigation process, strength of the patent portfolio, technology coverage and other pertinent information that could impact future net cash flows.

  Notes to the Financial Statements  
   
   Business segments    
   
 ASC 280,     Segment Reporting     requires use of the     management approach     model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company   s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company determined it has one operating segment as of September 30, 2016.  
   
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
   
 The Company   s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 consist principally of short term instruments which are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value.  The Company determines the fair value of these liabilities based on the effective yields of similar obligations. The Company believes all of the financial instruments    recorded values approximate fair market value because of their nature and respective durations. 
   
 The Company complies with the provisions of ASC No. 820-10 (   ASC 820-10   ),    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.     ASC 820-10 relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. 
   
   ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity   s own assumptions, about market participant assumptions, which are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820-10 are described below:  
   
   Level 1. Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.  
   
 Level 2. Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
   
   Level 3. Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
  On June 10, 2014, the FASB issued  Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10 ,  Development Stage Entities (Topic 915)     Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation , which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) in its entirety from current accounting guidance. The Company has elected early adoption of this new standard. 
   
 The Company has implemented all other new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

  Notes to the Financial Statements  
   
   3.   
   Going Concern   
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Currently, the Company has not established any revenue source and has incurred operating losses, and as of September 30, 2016 the Company had a working capital deficit of $453,590 and an accumulated deficit of $372,630. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company   s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company   s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company   s development efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future.   The conditions described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
   
   4.   
   Income Taxes   
   
 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
   The effective tax rate on the net loss before income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate as follows:  

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 

The Company has a net operating loss carryover of approximately $372,630 available to offset future income for income tax reporting purposes, which will expire in various years through 2032, if not previously utilized. However, the Company   s ability to use the carryover net operating loss may be substantially limited or eliminated pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382.The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, and    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes   . The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2013. 
   
 The Company   s policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes. During the period November 14, 2013(inception) through September 30, 2016, there were no income taxes, or related interest and penalty items in the income statement, or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada state jurisdiction.  We are not currently involved in any income tax examinations.

   Short Term Note Payable   
   
 On November 29, 2013, the company issued an unsecured promissory note payable to an individual for $75, 000. The note payable bears interest at 10 % per annum and all principal and accrued interest is due on December 1, 2014; the note was extended to July 20, 2015 and further extended to June 30, 2016. Since the term of the note payable is less than 12 months, the entire amount of the principal and accrued interest is presented as a current liability. A Revised Promissory Note for an additional $25,000 was signed in December 2014 with principal and interest (10%) until March 31, 2016 at which time the interest is increased to 12% for both loans. A new loan was extended to June 30, 2016 and again until June 30, 2017 with an automatic extension for another 90 days. At September 30, 2016 accrued interest on the both note payables is $26,834.  
   
 The note payable contains language which indicates that both parties have discussed in principal the terms of a conversion provision to the note payable, but only in the event that both parties execute a separate agreement. Until such an agreement is executed. The note payable is not convertible into common stock of the Company. 
   
 On May 28, 2014, the company, in a Share Exchange Agreement with Royal Bees Company, Inc. (whereby the surviving entity was Fitweiser Holdings, Inc). took over an unsecured promissory note payable to World Venture for $145,000. The note payable bears interest at 6% per annum and all principal and accrued interest is due on May 28, 2015. Since the term of the note payable is 12 months old, the entire amount of the principal and accrued interest is presented as a current liability.  See Paragraph 2. Intangible Asset- Short Term Note and Royal Bees Stock regarding an extension of the Note) At September 30, 2016 accrued interest on the note payable is $21,259. 
   
 On April 8, 2016, the company issued a short term note for $15,000 to Richard Villa with interest at 8% per annum with principal and interest due in full no later than June 30, 2017.

 Technology Assignment Release Agreement between Latin West Company and Fitweiser 
   
 As discussed in Note 7, the Company has agreed to the terms of a Technology Assignment Agreement with an individual who is the owner of two patent applications which will be treated as purchased intangible assets upon its completion. The Technology Assignment Agreement was originally negotiated by an entity owned by the CEO of the Company, which is a related party. As consideration for negotiating the agreement, and in concert with the Company entering into the technology assignment with the patent application holder, the Company simultaneously entered into a release agreement with the entity owned by the CEO of the Company which released all rights and claims the entity owned by the CEO had to the patent applications. As consideration for the release all rights and claims, the entity owned by the CEO of the company received a non-refundable deposit of $7,500. Additionally, if the Company is able to successfully execute the Technology Assignment Agreement, which is to be completed on or before July 31, 2014, the entity owned by the CEO will receive $67,500 within five business days of the execution of the technology assignment agreement. This agreement was extended to pay the entity $17,500 in the event the company closes any new round of debt and/or equity financing of $200,000 or more. Additionally, the company and the entity agreed to extend the July 31, 2014 date to May 28, 2015 and further extended to June 30, 2016 and extended to August 31, 2017. As of February 1, 2016, the Final Payment of $67,500 is due upon a Closing Date that will include a Cash Transaction, which is intended to occur on/before May 31, 2016, but can be automatically extended until August 31, 2016 and subsequently extended to August 31, 2017, or the Closing Date whichever occurs first without the need for a new agreement. Any previous Agreements between the individual and Fitweiser are now void. (See 7. Commitments and Contingencies) 
   
 During January of 2014 the company completed the following related party transactions which were classified as expense by the company. In July 2014, the consulting agreements for Soriano, Tuthill, Jason Campidonica, Red Rock Servicing, Langdon, and O   Hara were extended from January 31, 2015 to May 28, 2015, with some provisions to pay the consultants in stock in the event that the company has not completed a Qualified Round of Financing of $1,500,000 or more by January 31, 2015; these provisions were not exercised by the company. The consulting agreements for Tuthill, Jason Campidonica and Langdon were extended to August 31, 2016 and subsequently extended indefinitely, with a yearly review.  
   
 Michael Soriano did not fulfill his remaining consulting agreement beginning January 2015.

MANAGEMENT   S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   
  FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PLAN OF OPERATION  
   
  Description of Business.  
   
 The Company is a development stage entity that is engaged in the development and monetization of intellectual property worldwide. The Company's intellectual property (IP) portfolio consists of patent applications and an agreement to acquire patents covering analog and digital wireless communications and telecom, mobile technologies, cyber security and internet search and storage for business, consumer and government clientele. The Company   s patent applications have been developed internally. 
   
 Applications for our IP include dynamic, interactive and media-rich text, audio, video and virtual content and systems delivered through landline/cable and wireless broadband, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC) and other Rapidly Emerging Technologies serving multiple industry sectors that can include portable apps used in smart devices including cell phones, tablets, mobile and other devices for user-defined on and offline communications that encompass networking, input and output permission-based and/or restricted access, authentication, activation, recognition and monitoring for end-user demographic profiling and usage capture, audience capturing, data aggregation, interactive personalized targeting, site and/or cloud-based storage and search. 
   
 Entities that want to develop their own implementation of the Fitweiser patented or patent pending techniques to support uses that are covered by our patent portfolio for establishing secure or otherwise unique encrypted communication links, can purchase a patent license. The number of patents licensed, and therefore the cost of the patent license to those entities, will be negotiated based upon which of the patents are used in a particular product or service. These licenses will typically include an initial license fee, as well as an ongoing royalty. 
   
 We believe that the market opportunity for our cyber security and other unique software and technology solutions is large and expanding with increasing security requirements for the next generation 4G/LTE Advanced wireless networks and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications in various areas. Market sectors will include, but are not limited to government agencies (including Military), healthcare, hospitality, financial services and/or transactions including retail products and services, social networks, local and community services, entertainment, business, home and transportation. We also believe that all 4G/LTE Advanced mobile devices will require additional unique identities to prevent cyber-attacks as more users choose wireless for all of their communications, transactions and/or entertainment needs. 

16 

Competition  
   
 We have identified defined niches that are underserved and believe will embrace our software and technology. At this time, we do not believe that    direct    competition exists because we have identified defined niches that are underserved. However, on a broader basis, we certainly will face competition from firms who focus on wireless communications, internet and/or other emerging technologies that require secure environments and/or applications used in conjunction with cell phones and/or tablets. Therefore, we have identified three companies that we believe are at least in the business of developing significant patent portfolios to be licensed and/or purchased. The companies we have identified within the wireless and/or internet community are Parkervision, VirnetX and Vringo with a brief description of each as was found from public sources on the internet: 
   
  ParkerVision (PRKR)  
 Parkervision is focused on the commercialization of its proprietary RF communication technologies that enable significant advancements in wireless products and services. These technologies are described collectively as Energy Signal Processing    (ESP). ESP optimally processes RF waveform energy, eliminating costly and inefficient circuit processes inherent in traditional RF designs. 
   
  VirnetX (VHC)  
 The VirnetX portfolio of intellectual property is the foundation of their business model.  They currently own over 45 United States and foreign patents, as well as several pending U.S. and foreign patent applications.  Their patent portfolio is primarily focused on securing real-time communications over the Internet, as well as related services such as the establishment and maintenance of a secure domain name registry.  Their patented methods also have additional applications in operating systems and network security. 
   
  Vringo (VRNG)  
 Vringo, Inc. is engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of mobile technologies and intellectual property. Vringo's patent portfolio consists of 31 patents and applications, 11 of which have been granted. Through a recently completed merger with Innovate/Protect, Vringo owns a portfolio of eight patents acquired from Lycos, Inc. Vringo operates a global platform for the distribution of mobile social applications and services including Facetones  and Video Ringtones which transforms the basic act of making and receiving mobile phone calls into a highly visual, social experience. 
   
  Employees  
   
 At the present time we have no employees. The Company utilizes consultants and advisors for various tasks as required.
