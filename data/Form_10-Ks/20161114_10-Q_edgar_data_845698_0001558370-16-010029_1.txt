Note 1.  Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies   

Nature of business: Grant Park Futures Fund Limited Partnership (the  Partnership ) was organized as a limited partnership under Illinois law in August 1988 and will continue until December 31, 2027, unless terminated sooner as provided for in its Limited Partnership Agreement. As a commodity investment pool, the Partnership is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ), an agency of the United States (U.S.) government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of the various commodity exchanges where the Partnership executes transactions. Additionally, the Partnership is subject to the requirements of futures commission merchants ( FCMs ) and interbank and other market makers through which the Partnership trades. The Partnership is a registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and, accordingly is subject to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures and forward contracts for commodities, financial instruments or currencies, any rights pertaining thereto and any options thereon, or on physical commodities, equities, listed options, swap transactions and broad based exchange-traded funds. The Partnership may also engage in hedge, arbitrage and cash trading of commodities and futures. 

The Partnership is a multi-advisor commodity pool that invests the assets of each class of the Partnership in the Partnership s subsidiary limited liability trading companies (each, a  Trading Company  and collectively, the  Trading Companies )  which (i) enter into advisory agreements with the independent commodity trading advisors retained by the general partner; (ii) enter into swap transactions or derivative instruments tied to the performance of such trading advisors; and/or (iii) allocate assets to the Partnership s cash management trading company. The Partnership s general partner, commodity pool operator and sponsor is Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C. ( the General Partner ), an Illinois limited liability company. The Trading Companies were set up to, among other things, segregate risk by commodity trading advisor. Effectively, this structure isolates one trading advisor from another and any losses from one Trading Company will not carry over to the other Trading Companies. The following is a list of the Trading Companies, for which the Partnership is the sole member and all of which were organized as Delaware limited liability companies: 

GP 1, LLC ( GP 1 )   GP 5, LLC ( GP 5 )   GP 9, LLC ( GP 9 )       GP 15, LLC ( GP 15 ) 

GP 3, LLC ( GP 3 )   GP 6, LLC ( GP 6 )   GP 11, LLC ( GP 11 )   GP 17, LLC ( GP 17 ) 

GP 4, LLC ( GP 4 )   GP 8, LLC ( GP 8 )   GP 14, LLC ( GP 14 )   GP 18, LLC ( GP 18 ) 

There were no assets allocated to GP 3, GP 6 and GP 15 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Additionally, GP Cash Management, LLC ( GP Cash Management ) was created as a Delaware limited liability company to collectively manage and invest excess cash not required to be held at clearing brokers. The members of GP Cash Management are the Trading Companies. 

Classes of interests:   The Partnership has seven classes of limited partner interests (each, a  Class  and collectively, the  Interests ), Class A, Class B, Legacy 1 Class, Legacy 2 Class, Global Alternative Markets 1 ( Global 1 ) Class, Global Alternative Markets 2 ( Global 2 ) Class and Global Alternative Markets 3 ( Global 3 ) Class units. 

The Class A and Class B units are outstanding but are no longer offered by the Partnership. Both Class A and Class B units are traded pursuant to identical trading programs and differ only in respect to the brokerage charge payable to the General Partner. 

The Legacy 1 Class and Legacy 2 Class units are traded pursuant to trading programs pursuing a technical trend trading philosophy, which is the same trading philosophy used for the Class A and Class B units. The Legacy 1 Class and Legacy 2 Class units differ in respect to the General Partner s brokerage charge and organization and offering costs. The Legacy 1 Class and Legacy 2 Class units are offered only to investors who are represented by approved

(Unaudited) 

selling agents who are directly compensated by the investor for services rendered in connection with an investment in the Partnership (such arrangements commonly referred to as  wrap-accounts ). 

The Global 1 Class, Global 2 Class and Global 3 Class units are traded pursuant to trading programs pursuing technical trend trading philosophies. The Global 1 Class, Global 2 Class and Global 3 Class units differ in respect to the General Partner s brokerage charge. The Global 1 Class and Global 2 Class units are offered only to investors in wrap accounts. 

The Partnership s significant accounting policies are as follows: 

Accounting Principles:   Pursuant to rules and regulations of the SEC, audited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). The Partnership is an investment company and follows accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,   Financial Services   Investment Companies  . 

Consolidation:   The Partnership is the sole member of each of the Trading Companies. The Trading Companies, in turn, are the only members of GP Cash Management. The Partnership presents consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Trading Companies and GP Cash Management. All material inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and cash equivalents:   Cash and cash equivalents may include cash, overnight investments, commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, money market funds and short-term investments in interest-bearing demand deposits with banks and cash managers with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition. 

Valuation of investments:   All investments are used for trading purposes and recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 2. Substantially all of the Partnership s assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments and are recorded at fair value or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments. 

Investment transactions, investment income and expenses:   Futures contracts, forward contracts and options on futures and forward contracts are recorded on a trade date basis and realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts/positions are liquidated. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts/positions (the difference between contract trade price and market price) or securities are reported in the consolidated statement of financial condition as a net unrealized gain or loss, as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in accordance with FASB ASC 210-20,   Balance Sheet, Offsetting  . Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the consolidated statement of operations. Interest income and expense is recognized under the accrual basis. 

Set forth in Note 10 are instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the consolidated statement of financial condition and which are subject to derivative clearing agreements with the Partnership s clearing brokers.  Each clearing broker nets margin held on behalf of the Partnership or payment obligations of the clearing broker to the Partnership against any payment obligations of the Partnership to the clearing broker.  The Partnership is required to deposit margin at each clearing broker to meet the original and maintenance requirements established by that clearing broker, and/or the exchange or clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the instrument is traded.  The derivative clearing agreements give each clearing broker a security interest in this margin to secure any liabilities owed to the clearing broker arising from a default by the Partnership.

(Unaudited) 

Commissions:   Commissions and other trading fees are expensed when contracts are opened and closed, and are reflected separately in the consolidated statement of operations. 

Redemptions payable:   Pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  , redemptions approved by the General Partner prior to month end with a fixed effective date and fixed amount are recorded as redemptions payable as of month end. 

Income taxes:   No provision for income taxes has been made in these consolidated financial statements as each partner is individually responsible for reporting income or loss based on its respective share of the Partnership s income and expenses as reported for income tax purposes. 

The Partnership follows the provisions of ASC 740,   Income Taxes  . FASB guidance requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Partnership s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained  when challenged  or  when examined  by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense and liability in the current year. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties, an expense for the amount of the statutory penalty and interest, if applicable, shall be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the position is claimed or expected to be claimed.  As of September 30, 2016, management has determined that there are no material uncertain income tax positions and, accordingly, has not recorded a liability. The Partnership is generally not subject to examination by U.S. federal or state taxing authorities for tax years before 2013. 

Organization and offering costs:   All expenses incurred in connection with the organization and the ongoing public offering of partnership interests are paid by the General Partner and are reimbursed to the General Partner by the Partnership. This reimbursement is made monthly. In its discretion, the General Partner may require the Partnership to reimburse the General Partner in any subsequent calendar year for amounts that exceed the limits in Note 5 in any calendar year, provided that the maximum amount reimbursed by the Partnership will not exceed the overall limit. Amounts reimbursed by the Partnership with respect to ongoing public offering expenses are charged to expense from operations at the time of reimbursement or accrual. Any amounts reimbursed by the Partnership with respect to organizational expenses are expensed at the time the reimbursement is incurred or accrued. If the Partnership terminates prior to completion of payment of the calculated amounts to the General Partner, the General Partner will not be entitled to any additional payments, and the Partnership will have no further obligation to the General Partner. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all organization and offering costs incurred by the General Partner have been reimbursed. 

Foreign currency transactions:   The Partnership s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income currently. 

The Partnership does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized or unrealized gain or loss from investments. 

Swap contracts:   Certain Trading Companies of the Partnership strategically allocate a portion or all of their assets to total return swaps selected at the direction of the General Partner. A swap is a bilaterally negotiated agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows based upon an asset, rate or some other reference index. In a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are   

12 

Table of Contents  

Grant Park Futures Fund Limited Partnership 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

calculated with respect to a  notional amount  (i.e., the amount or value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate, return, or other amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of commodities or other investments representing a particular index.  Changes in the value of the swap agreement are recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statement of operations by marking to market on a daily basis to reflect the value of the swap agreement at the end of each day as reported by the swap counterparty. Realized gains and losses from a decrease in the notional value of the swap are recognized on trade date. A liquidation payment received or made at the termination of the swap agreement will first be offset against the swap balance outstanding at the time the position is liquidated, with the remainder being recorded as a realized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations.  Through its Trading Companies the Partnership has entered into total return swaps with Deutsche Bank AG.  The Partnership maintains cash as collateral to secure its obligations under the swaps.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notional value of the swaps was $60,638,617 and $20,000,000, respectively, and the cash margin balance was $12,996,500 and $4,000,000, respectively.  The swaps were effective July 1, 2015 and April 5, 2016 and have a term of five years and three years, respectively. 

Statement of cash flows:   The Partnership has elected not to provide statements of cash flows as permitted by FASB ASC 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  . The Partnership noted that as of and for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, substantially all investments are carried at fair value and classified as Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, the Partnership carried no debt, and the statements of changes in partners  capital (net asset value) is presented. 

Reclassification:   Certain amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation. 

Recent accounting pronouncements:   In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation   (Topic 810) containing guidance for reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Partnership adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15     Presentation of Financial Statement   Going Concern   (Subtopic 205-40) containing guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures.  The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement would have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)   Deferral of Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606).  The amendments in ASU 2014-09 affect any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards.  In March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, respectively.  The amendments in these updates affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The scope of that Topic includes entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration.   The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact these pronouncements would have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01   Financial Instruments   Overall   (Subtopic 825-10) Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities.  The amendments in this update affect all entities that   

13 

Table of Contents  

Grant Park Futures Fund Limited Partnership 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities.   The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement would have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  .  The amendments in this update apply to all reporting entities for which there is a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under Topic 815.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods with those fiscal years.  The adoption of ASU 2016-05 is not expected to have an impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2. Fair Value Measurements 

As described in Note 1, the Partnership follows the provisions of FASB ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  . FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy. The Partnership utilizes valuation techniques to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2. Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. A significant adjustment to a Level 2 input could result in the Level 2 measurement becoming a Level 3 measurement. 

Level 3. Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. The Partnership does not have any assets classified as Level 3. 

The following section describes the valuation techniques used by the Partnership to measure different financial instruments at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the financial instrument is categorized. 

Fair value of exchange-traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts are based upon exchange settlement prices as of the last business day of the reporting period. These financial instruments are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The Partnership values forward contracts and options on forward contracts based on the average bid and ask price of quoted forward spot prices obtained as of the last business day of the reporting period, and forward contracts and options on forward contracts are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The Partnership values bank deposits, which consist of interest bearing demand deposits and are included in cash and cash equivalents in the statements of financial condition, at face value plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value based on prevailing interest rates, and these financial instruments are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The fair value of money market funds are based upon exchange settlement prices as of the last business day of the reporting period.  These financial instruments are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

U.S. Government securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities and commercial paper are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value based on quoted market prices in an active market. The Partnership compares market prices quoted by dealers to the cost plus accrued interest to ensure a reasonable approximation of fair value. These securities are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The Partnership values corporate bonds at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Corporate bonds purchased are of a high credit quality and have observable market price quotations. The fair value of corporate bonds is evaluated considering market prices of the issuer quoted by dealers. Corporate bonds are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The investments in total return swaps are reported at fair value based on daily price reporting from the swap counterparty. The Partnership s swap transactions are a two-party contract entered into primarily to exchange the returns earned or realized on particular pre-determined investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between parties are calculated with respect to a notional amount. The total return swaps have inputs which are transparent and can generally be corroborated by market data and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table presents the Partnership s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016: 

The gross presentation of the fair value of the Partnership s derivatives by contract type is shown in Note 10. See the consolidated condensed schedule of investments for detail by sector.

The gross presentation of the fair value of the Partnership s derivatives by contract type is shown in Note 10. See the consolidated condensed schedule of investments for detail by sector. 

The Partnership assesses the level of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Partnership s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015. 

Note 3. Deposits with Brokers and Interbank Market Makers 

The Partnership, through the Trading Companies, deposits assets with UBS Securities LLC, SG Americas Securities, LLC, formerly Newedge USA, LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC subject to CFTC regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. Margin requirements may be satisfied by the deposit of U.S. Treasury bills, Government- sponsored enterprise securities and/or cash with such clearing brokers. The Partnership may earn interest income on its assets deposited with the clearing brokers.  

The Partnership, through the Trading Companies, has entered into a relationship with Soci t  G n rale Newedge UK Limited and UBS AG for the clearing of its OTC foreign currency transactions and with Deutsche Bank AG for its swap transactions.  The Partnership has entered into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreement with Deutsche Bank AG, Soci t  G n rale Newedge UK Limited and UBS AG.  Margin requirements may be satisfied by the deposit of U.S. Treasury bills and/or cash with such interbank market makers or swap counterparties. The Partnership may earn interest income on its assets deposited with the interbank market makers. 

Note 4. Commodity Trading Advisors 

The Partnership, through the Trading Companies, allocates assets to the commodity trading advisors or through swap transactions based on reference programs of such advisors. Each trading advisor that receives a direct allocation from the Partnership has entered into an advisory contract with the Partnership.

Capital Management Limited ( Winton ) (collectively, the  Advisors ). The Advisors are paid a consulting fee, either monthly or quarterly, directly or through swap transactions, ranging from 0 percent to 2 percent per annum of the Partnership s month-end allocated net assets and a quarterly or semi-annual incentive fee, directly or through swap transactions, ranging from 20 percent to 24.5 percent of the new trading profits on the allocated net assets of the Advisor. 

Note 5. General Partner and Related Party Transactions 

The General Partner shall at all times, so long as it remains a general partner of the Partnership, own Units in the Partnership: (i) in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of counsel for the Partnership, for the Partnership to be taxed as a partnership rather than as an association taxable as a corporation; and (ii) during such time as the Units are registered for sale to the public, in an amount at least equal to the greater of: (a) 1 percent of all capital contributions of all Partners to the Partnership; or (b) $25,000; or such other amount satisfying the requirements then imposed by the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (NASAA) Guidelines. Further, during such time as the Units are registered for sale to the public, the General Partner shall, so long as it remains a general partner of the Partnership, maintain a net worth (as such term may be defined in the NASAA Guidelines) at least equal to the greater of: (i) 5 percent of the total capital contributions of all partners and all limited partnerships to which it is a general partner (including the Partnership) plus 5 percent of the Units being offered for sale in the Partnership; or (ii) $50,000; or such other amount satisfying the requirements then imposed by the NASAA Guidelines. In no event, however, shall the General Partner be required to maintain a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or such other maximum amount satisfying the requirements then imposed by the NASAA Guidelines. 

Ten percent of the General Partners limited partnership interest in the Partnership is characterized as a general partnership interest. Notwithstanding, the general partnership interest will continue to pay all fees associated with a limited partnership interest. 

The Partnership pays the General Partner a monthly brokerage charge, organization and offering costs and operating expenses as presented in the table below: 

*The fees are calculated and payable monthly on the basis of month-end adjusted net assets.  Adjusted net assets  is defined as the month-end net assets of the particular class before accruals for fees and expenses and redemptions. 

Included in the total brokerage charge are amounts paid to the clearing brokers for execution and clearing costs, which are reflected in the commissions line of the consolidated statements of operations, and the remaining amounts are management fees paid to the Advisors, compensation to the selling agents and an amount to the General Partner for management services rendered, which are reflected in the brokerage charge line on the consolidated statements of operations. The brokerage charge in the amount of $2,293,183 and $7,517,779, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $3,170,861 and $  10,657,787  , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, are shown on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Transaction costs and consulting fees are taken into account in determining the net amount the Partnership receives or pays in connection with swap transactions, but such costs or fees are not directly charged to the Partnership or any of its trading companies. The general partner will reduce (but not below zero) the brokerage charge by the amount

of such costs and fees. Each class of units pays a fee to a counterparty in respect of any swap transaction of up to 0.50% of the notional amount of such swap transaction. 

Ongoing organization and offering costs of the Partnership are paid for by the General Partner and reimbursed by the Partnership. The organization and offering costs in the amounts of $140,050 and $446,843, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and   $182,058 and $602,272, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , are shown on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Operating expenses of the Partnership are paid for by the General Partner and reimbursed by the Partnership. To the extent operating expenses are less than 0.25 percent of the Partnership s average month-end net assets during the year, the difference may be reimbursed pro rata to record-holders as of December 31 of each year. The operating expenses in the amounts of $120,999 and $385,937, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $157,497 and $520,538, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015, are shown on the consolidated statement of operations. 

An entity owned in part and controlled by Mr. Kavanagh, who indirectly controls and is president of Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., the general partner of the Partnership, and in part by Mr. Al Rayes, who is a principal of the general partner, and an entity owned in part and controlled by Mr. Meehan, the chief operating officer of the general partner, purchased a minority ownership interest in EMC, which is one of the commodity trading advisors of the Partnership.  The general partner, on behalf of the Partnership, pays EMC a quarterly consulting fee and a quarterly incentive fee based on new trading profits, if any, achieved on EMC s allocated net assets at the end of each period.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, EMC was paid approximately $111,300 and $370,200, respectively, in consulting fees and $0 and $47,500, respectively, in incentive fees.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, EMC was paid approximately $116,700 and $369,100, respectively, in consulting fees and $4,000 and $59,800, respectively, in incentive fees.      

Note 6. Subscriptions, Redemptions and Allocation of Net Income or Loss 

Subscriptions received in advance, if any, represent cash received prior to September 30 for contributions of the subsequent month and do not participate in earnings of the Partnership until the following July. 

Class A, Class B, Legacy 1 Class, Legacy 2 Class, Global 1 Class, Global 2 Class and Global 3 Class Limited Partners have the right to redeem units as of any month-end upon ten (10) days  prior written notice to the Partnership. The General Partner, however, may permit earlier redemptions in its discretion. Legacy 1 Class, Legacy 2 Class, Global 1 Class, Global 2 Class and Global 3 Class Limited Partners are prohibited from redeeming such units for the three months following the subscription for units. Global 3 Class Limited Partners who redeem their units after the three-month lock-up, but prior to the one-year anniversary of their subscriptions for the redeemed units, will pay the applicable early redemption fee. There are no redemption fees applicable to Legacy 1 Class, Legacy 2 Class, Global 1 Class and Global 2 Class Limited Partners or to Global 3 Class Limited Partners who redeem their units on or after the one-year anniversary of their subscription. Redemptions will be made as of the last day of the month for an amount equal to the net asset value per unit, as defined, represented by the units to be redeemed. The right to obtain redemption is also contingent upon the Partnership s having property sufficient to discharge its liabilities on the redemption date and may be delayed if the General Partner determines that earlier liquidation of commodity interest positions to meet redemption payments would be detrimental to the Partnership or nonredeeming Limited Partners. 

In addition, the General Partner may at any time cause the redemption of all or a portion of any Limited Partner s units upon fifteen (15) days  written notice. The General Partner may also immediately redeem any Limited Partner s units without notice if the General Partner believes that (i) the redemption is necessary to avoid having the assets of the Partnership deemed Plan Assets under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), (ii) the Limited Partner made a misrepresentation in connection with its subscription for the units, or (iii) the redemption is necessary to avoid a violation of law by the Partnership or any Partner.

In accordance with the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, net income or loss of the Partnership is allocated to partners according to their respective interests in the Partnership as of the beginning of the month. 

Note 7. Financial Highlights 

The following financial highlights reflect activity related to the Partnership. Total return is based on the change in value during the period of a theoretical investment made by a limited partner at the beginning of each calendar month during the period and is not annualized. Individual limited partners  ratios may vary from these ratios based on various factors, including but not limited to the timing of capital transactions. 

(1) 

Annualized.     

(2) 

Not annualized.     

(3) 

Excludes incentive fee.     

The expense ratios above are computed based upon the weighted average net assets of the Partnership for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (annualized). 

The following per unit performance calculations reflect activity related to the Partnership for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

* Expenses net of interest income per unit are calculated by dividing the expenses net of interest income by the average number of units outstanding during the period. The net realized and change in unrealized gain (loss) from trading is a balancing amount necessary to reconcile the change in net asset value per unit with the other per unit information. 

Note 8. Trading Activities and Related Risks 

The Partnership, through its Advisors or swap transactions based on reference programs of such advisors, engages in the speculative trading of a variety of instruments, including U.S. and foreign futures contracts, options on U.S. and foreign futures contracts and forward contracts and other derivative instruments including swap contracts (collectively, derivatives; see Note 10). These derivatives include both financial and nonfinancial contracts held as part of a diversified trading strategy. Additionally, the Partnership s speculative trading includes equities and exchange-

(Unaudited) 

traded funds. The Partnership is exposed to both market risk, the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract. 

The purchase and sale of futures and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with FCMs. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the FCM s segregation requirements. In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited. The Partnership utilizes UBS Securities LLC, SG Americas Securities, LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as its clearing brokers. 

The amount of required margin and good faith deposits with the FCMs, interbank market makers and swap counterparties usually ranges from 5% to 35% of the Partnership s net asset value.  The cash deposited with the FCMs, interbank market makers and swap counterparties at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $39,893,502 and $38,781,351, respectively, which was 21.95% and 18.14% of the net asset value, respectively. 

For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the fair value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Partnership is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. As both a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Partnership to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid. 

In addition to market risk, trading futures, forwards and swap contracts entails a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. The counterparty for futures and options on futures contracts traded in the United States and on most non-U.S. futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases in which the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some non-U.S. exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In the case of forward contracts, over-the-counter options contracts or swap contracts, which are traded on the interbank or other institutional markets rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearinghouse backed by a group of financial institutions; thus, there likely will be greater counterparty credit risk. The Partnership trades only with those counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Partnership are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. 

Unlike futures and options on futures contracts, most swap contracts currently are not traded on or cleared by an exchange or clearinghouse. The CFTC currently requires only a limited class of swap contracts (certain interest rate and credit default swaps) to be cleared and executed on an exchange or other organized trading platform. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC will determine in the future whether other classes of swap contracts will be required to be cleared and executed on an exchange or other organized trading platform. Until such time as these transactions are cleared, the Partnership will be subject to a greater risk of counterparty default on its swaps. Because swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal, the amount payable upon default and early termination is usually calculated by reference to the current market value of the contract. Swap dealers and major swap participants require the Partnership to deposit initial margin and variation margin as collateral to support such obligation under the swap agreement but may not themselves provide collateral for the benefit of the Partnership. If the counterparty to such a swap agreement defaults, the Partnership would be a general unsecured creditor for any termination amounts owed by   

22 

Table of Contents  

Grant Park Futures Fund Limited Partnership 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

the counterparty to the Partnership as well as for any collateral deposits in excess of the amounts owed by the Partnership to the counterparty, which would result in losses to the Partnership.  

There are no limitations on daily price movements in swap transactions. Speculative position limits are not currently applicable to swaps, but in the future may be applicable for swaps on certain commodities. In addition, participants in swap markets are not required to make continuous markets in the swaps they trade, and determining a market value for calculation of termination amounts can lead to uncertain results. 

Securities sold short represent obligations of the Partnership to deliver specific securities and thereby create a liability to purchase these instruments in the open market at prevailing prices. These transactions may result in market risk not reflected in the consolidated statement of financial condition as the Partnership s ultimate obligation to satisfy its obligation for trading liabilities may exceed the amount reflected in the consolidated statement of financial condition. 

The Partnership maintains deposits with high quality financial institutions in amounts that are in excess of federally insured limits; however, the Partnership does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk. 

The General Partner has established procedures to actively monitor and minimize market and credit risks. The Limited Partners bear the risk of loss only to the extent of the fair value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received. 

Note 9. Indemnifications 

In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Partnership that have not yet occurred.  The Partnership expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote. 

Note 10. Derivative Instruments 

The Partnership follows the provisions of FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. FASB ASC 815 is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FASB ASC 815 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of FASB ASC 815-10-05. It also applies to non-derivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying as hedges under FASB ASC 815-10-05. FASB ASC 815 amends the current qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities set forth in FASB ASC 815-10-05 and generally increases the level of disaggregation that will be required in an entity s financial statements. FASB ASC 815 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements (see Trading Activities and Related Risks, Note 8). 

The Partnership s business is speculative trading. The Partnership intends to close out all futures, options on futures and forward contracts prior to their expiration. The Partnership trades in futures and other commodity interest contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market risk and credit risk. In entering into these contracts, the Partnership faces the market risk that these contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. The Partnership minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 25%.

In addition to market risk, in entering into commodity interest contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. In general, clearing organizations are backed by the corporate members of the clearing organization who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases in which the clearing organization is not backed by the clearing members, like some non-U.S. exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In the case of forward contracts, over-the-counter options contracts or swap contracts, which are traded on the interbank or other institutional market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a central clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will likely be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. The Partnership trades only with those counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy. Nonetheless, the clearing member, clearing organization or other counterparty to these transactions may not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership, in which case the Partnership could suffer significant losses on these contracts. 

The Partnership does not designate any derivative instruments as hedging instruments under FASB ASC 815-10-05.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the monthly average futures contracts bought and sold was approximately 46,743 and 51,975, respectively, and the monthly average forward contracts bought and sold was approximately 532 and 515, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the monthly average futures contracts bought and sold was approximately 51,231 and 66,124, respectively, and the monthly average forward contracts bought and sold was approximately 2,168 and 11,460, respectively. The following tables summarize the quantitative information required by FASB ASC 815:

ITEM 2.      MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 

Grant Park is a multi-advisor commodity pool organized to pool assets of its investors for the purpose of trading in the U.S. and international spot and derivatives markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products, precious and base metals and other commodities and underliers. The Partnership also engages in equity securities, listed options, broad-based exchange traded funds, hedge, arbitrage and cash trading of commodities, futures and swap contracts. Grant Park has been in continuous operation since it commenced trading on January 1, 1989. Grant Park s general partner, commodity pool operator and sponsor is Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C., an Illinois limited liability company. The manager of Dearborn Capital Management, L.L.C. is David M. Kavanagh, its President. 

Organization of Grant Park 

Grant Park invests the assets of each class of Grant Park in various Trading Companies which (i) enter into advisory agreements with the independent commodity trading advisors retained by the general partner; (ii) enter into swap transactions or derivative instruments tied to the performance of such trading advisors; and/or (iii) allocate assets to Grant Park s cash management trading company. The following is a list of the Trading Companies, for which Grant Park is the sole member and all of which were organized as Delaware limited liability companies: 

GP 1, LLC ( GP 1 )   GP 5, LLC ( GP 5 )   GP 9, LLC ( GP 9 )       GP 15, LLC ( GP 15 ) 

GP 3, LLC ( GP 3 )   GP 6, LLC ( GP 6 )   GP 11, LLC ( GP 11 )   GP 17, LLC ( GP 17 ) 

GP 4, LLC ( GP 4 )   GP 8, LLC ( GP 8 )   GP 14, LLC ( GP 14 )   GP 18, LLC ( GP 18 ) 

There were no assets allocated to GP 3, GP 6, and GP 15 as of September 30, 2016 

Grant Park invests through the Trading Companies with independent professional commodity trading advisors or through swap transactions based on reference programs of such advisors. Amplitude Capital International Limited, EMC Capital Advisors LLC, H2O Asset Management LLP, Lynx Asset Management AB, Quantica Capital AG, Rabar Market Research, Inc., Revolution Capital Management LLC, Transtrend B.V. and Winton Capital Management Limited serve as Grant Park s commodity trading advisors or through swap transactions based on reference programs of such advisors. Each of the trading advisors that receives a direct allocation of assets from Grant Park is registered as a commodity trading advisor under the Commodity Exchange Act and is a member of the NFA.  As of September 30, 2016, the general partner allocated between 5% to 25% of Grant Park s net assets through the respective Trading Companies among its trading advisors or through swap transactions based on reference programs of such advisors to Amplitude, EMC, H2O, Lynx, Quantica, Rabar, RCM, Transtrend and Winton. No more than 25% of Grant Park s assets are allocated to any one Trading Company and, in turn, any one trading advisor. The general partner may terminate or replace the trading advisors or retain additional trading advisors in its sole discretion.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Grant Park s most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its assets invested in U.S. and international futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap transactions, other interests in commodities, and fixed income products. The majority of these investments are exchange-traded contracts, valued based upon exchange settlement prices. The remainder of its investments are non-exchange-traded contracts with valuation of those investments based on quoted forward spot prices, swap transactions with the valuation based on daily price reporting from the swap counterparty, and fixed income products, including securities of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds and commercial paper, which are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value based on quoted market prices in an active market. With the valuation of the investments easily obtained, there is little or no judgment or uncertainty involved in the valuation of investments, and accordingly, it is unlikely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different but reasonably plausible assumptions. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Grant Park s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. 

Grant Park is the sole member of each of the Trading Companies. The Trading Companies, in turn, are the only members of GP Cash Management, LLC. Grant Park presents consolidated financial statements which include the accounts of the Trading Companies and GP Cash Management, LLC. All material inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

Valuation of Financial Instruments 

Grant Park follows the provisions of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Grant Park utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange traded) contracts, option contracts, swap transactions, other interests in commodities and fixed income products. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement and also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Grant Park records all investments at fair value in the financial statements. Changes in fair value from the prior period are recorded as unrealized gain or losses and are reported in the consolidated statement of operations. Fair value of exchange-traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts are based upon exchange settlement prices. Grant Park values forward contracts and options on forward contracts based on the average bid and ask price of quoted forward spot prices obtained. U.S. Government securities, securities of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds and commercial paper are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value based on quoted market prices in an active market. Grant Park compares market prices quoted by dealers to the cost plus accrued interest to ensure a reasonable approximation of fair value. Grant Park values bank deposits at face value plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. The investment in the total return swap is reported at fair value based on daily price reporting from the swap counterparty.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 

Grant Park registered losses in the third quarter as gains in the equities, agriculturals and softs sectors were offset by losses in the energy, fixed income, metals and currencies sectors.     

For July, positive performance was driven by investments in the equities markets.  Grant Park's long exposure capitalized as equities rebounded from post-Brexit declines during the beginning of July.  The markets moved lower and traded within a narrow range during the middle of the month, during which corporate earnings reports in the U.S. generally contained smaller-than-expected declines in quarterly earnings and rallied to end the month higher. Long positions in metals added to gains as metals prices moved higher due to political unrest in Turkey and the Eurozone.  Long dollar positions partially offset gains with losses in the Japanese yen as its value decreased in anticipation of quantitative easing, only to reverse direction after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly declined to announce any actions. 

August's performance was negative and largely driven by positions in energy, metals, fixed income and currencies markets.  An increase in prices across the energy sector moved against Grant Park s existing short positions in heating oil, crude oil, and gas oil positions.  The majority of energy positions were liquidated as prices increased and overall exposure to the sector was reduced by month-end.  The Federal Reserve s ambiguous commitment to raising interest rates negatively impacted multiple markets.  Yields in the fixed-income markets rose as investors anticipated an interest rate increase in September.  Grant Park s long exposure to the sector lost value and overall exposure to the sector was reduced from 25% to 21%.  The prospect of higher interest rates also caused precious metals prices to fall, which further added to Grant Park s losses. 

Grant Park s performance was negative in September because of negative performance in the fixed income, energy, metals and equities markets.  Long exposure to the fixed-income markets experienced losses as the price for U.S. 30-Year Treasury Bonds fell due to concerns about inflation and a December rate hike.   Long exposure to metals markets registered losses as prices fell following economic data that showed a robust economy and hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials. In the energy sector, OPEC issued guidance near the end of September that suggested future production cuts.  The announcement firmed current price levels and increased the odds for more price stability in the future.  Long positions in the equities sector lost value as indices performed poorly on concerns about the stability of the financial sector.

dollar.  Equity markets were also helped by easing concerns over global growth, by the Federal Reserve's clarification about interest rate increases and by the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates and to increase its quantitative easing initiatives.  Global fixed income markets moved lower as positive economic data and gains in the equity and commodity markets reduced demand for the safe haven assets.

Positive housing data also added strength to the currency.  The British pound moved higher following better-than-expected economic news out of the Eurozone.

Global equity markets finished slightly higher despite disappointing earnings reports, particularly in the technology sector.  Global equity markets rose on better-than-expected Chinese trade data, lower expectations of an immediate U.S. interest rate hike and positive U.S. employment data.    Global fixed income markets moved lower due to positive Chinese trade data, encouraging U.S. employment data and shifting expectations about rate hikes.

Crude oil prices rose as demand increased and risks to future supplies were reinforced by a pipeline disruption in Nigeria and wildfires in Alberta, Canada.  A decline in the number of active U.S. oil rigs and in U.S. crude stockpiles also moved crude oil markets higher.  Natural gas prices rose as forecasts for warm weather raised expectations of increased demand.

Crude oil prices moved within a narrow range throughout the month, rose, and ended the month essentially unchanged.  Natural gas prices continued a three-month rise as weather-related demand continued to increase.  The global equities markets roiled during post-Brexit trading sessions.  Equities in Europe and Asia experienced sharp declines after the British vote but were able to partially recover value before the end of the month.

Soybean prices traded over a wide price range during the month and ended the month slightly below the intra-month high.

Precious metals markets rose sharply as investors sought safe-haven assets in the uncertainty about the implications and timing of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union.

Equities sectors rebounded from post-Brexit declines during the beginning of July.  The markets moved lower and traded within a narrow range during the middle of the month and then rallied to end the month higher due to corporate earnings reports in the U.S. which generally contained smaller-than-expected declines in quarterly earnings.        Fixed income markets also traded in narrow ranges during July as global investors assessed whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in September, the Bank of Japan would expand its accommodative monetary policy, and the Bank of England and the ECB would intervene in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.  Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and cocoa fell slightly during July in the absence of any significant information or adverse weather conditions that would significantly impact the supplies of the commodities.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Grant Park experienced minor setbacks as gains from the fixed-income and metals sectors were slightly outweighed by losses in the equity and currency markets.     

For July, positions in the metals markets drove positive performance.  Grant Park's short positions in the base metals gained value as markets fell sharply after China reported weak economic data, which further depressed industrial demand for non-precious metals.  Short positions in the precious metals sector also gained in value after the Federal Reserve indicated it would support an interest rate hike in 2015.  The Fed's apparent position reduced demand for dollar-hedging assets which, in turn, drove gold prices lower.  The resulting strength in the U.S. dollar benefitted Grant Park s long-dollar exposure.  Positions in the grains markets registered losses after the U.S. Department of Agriculture increased its crop-yield estimates and caused a sharp selloff.  Grant Park s held long positions when the price reversal occurred and the positions lost value.   

Grant Park had negative performance in August because of sharp reversals in the equity and currency markets.  The Chinese equity markets experienced several downturns throughout the month.  These events sparked investor concerns about the state of the global economy and triggered a wide-scale selloff in equity markets worldwide.  Grant Park held long positions at the onset of the sharp reversals and lost money as prices trended down.  Grant Park reduced its long exposure and was ultimately short for the sector at month's end.  Equity market weakness indirectly pressured the U.S. dollar lower and against Grant Park's long exposure as investors doubted the overall strength of the global economy and questioned whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in the near-term.  Additionally, short positions in the energy markets experienced losses after an emergency meeting by OPEC supported a potential decline in global production and drove prices in the crude oil complex higher.    

September's performance was strong and positive.  Long positions in the debt markets profited when tepid economic indicators in the U.S. combined with concerns about economic growth abroad to fuel increased demand for safe-haven assets.  The decision by the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged drove the fixed-income markets higher.  Finally, short exposure to the energy sector gained value after energy supplies were reported to have increased, which drove prices lower as demand fell, due, in part, to forecasts for reduced industrial demand from China. 

Key trading developments for Grant Park during the first nine months of 2015 included the following:

Soybean markets moved to a new low as export sales slipped because of large cancellations by China.

Capital Resources 

Grant Park plans to raise additional capital only through the sale of units pursuant to the continuous offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of Grant Park s business, it does not make any capital expenditures and does not have any capital assets that are not operating capital or assets.  

Grant Park maintains 65% to 95% of its net asset value in cash, cash equivalents or other liquid positions over and above that needed to post as collateral for trading. These funds are available to meet redemptions each month. 

Liquidity 

Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in some futures and options contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent Grant Park from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject Grant Park to substantial losses that could exceed the margin initially committed to those trades. In addition, even if futures or options prices do not move to the daily limit, Grant Park may not be able to execute trades at favorable prices, if little trading in the contracts is taking place. Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in Grant Park s futures and options trading operations, Grant Park s assets are expected to be highly liquid. 

A portion of each Trading Company s assets is used as margin to support its trading. Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of U.S. Treasury bills, obligations of Government-sponsored enterprises and/or cash with brokers subject to CFTC regulations and various exchange and broker requirements.

Grant Park maintains a portion of its assets at its clearing brokers as well as at Lake Forest Bank   Trust Company. These assets, which may range from 5% to 35% of Grant Park s value, are held in cash, U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper and/or securities of Government-sponsored enterprises. The balance of Grant Park s assets, which range from 65% to 95%, are invested in investment grade money market instruments purchased and managed by Middleton Dickinson Capital Management, LLC which are held in a separate account in the name of GP Cash Management, LLC and custodied at State Street Bank and Trust Company. Violent fluctuations in prevailing interest rates or changes in other economic conditions could cause mark-to-market losses on Grant Park s cash management income. 

Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

Off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. Grant Park trades in futures, swap transactions and other commodity interest contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts, Grant Park faces the market risk that these contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the commodity interest positions of Grant Park at the same time, and if Grant Park were unable to offset positions, Grant Park could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a 100% loss. Grant Park minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 25%. All positions of Grant Park are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. 

In addition to market risk, when entering into commodity interest contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to Grant Park. The counterparty for futures and options on futures contracts traded in the United States and on most non-U.S. futures exchanges is the clearing organization associated with such exchange. In general, clearing organizations are backed by the corporate members of the clearing organization who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. 

In cases where the clearing organization is not backed by the clearing members, like some non- U.S. exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In the case of forward contracts, over-the-counter options contracts or swap contracts, which are traded on the interbank or other institutional market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a central clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there likely will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. Grant Park trades only with those counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy. Nonetheless, the clearing member, clearing organization or other counterparty to these transactions may not be able to meet its obligations to Grant Park, in which case Grant Park could suffer significant losses on these contracts. 

In the normal course of business, Grant Park enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. Grant Park s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against Grant Park that have not yet occurred. Grant Park expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote. 

ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Introduction 

Grant Park is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of Grant Park s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to Grant Park s business.  

43 

Table of Contents  

Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of Grant Park s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. Grant Park s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, market prices for base and precious metals, energy complexes and other commodities, the diversification effects among Grant Park s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.  

Grant Park rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance. Erratic, choppy, sideways trading markets and sharp reversals in movements can materially and adversely affect Grant Park s results. Likewise, markets in which a potential price trend may start to develop but reverses before an actual trend is realized may result in unprofitable transactions. Grant Park s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.  

Materiality, as used in this section, is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage, and multiplier features of Grant Park s market sensitive instruments. 

The following quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding Grant Park s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). All quantitative and qualitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements, except for statements of historical fact and descriptions of how Grant Park manages its risk exposure. Grant Park s primary market risk exposures, as well as the strategies used and to be used by its trading advisors for managing such exposures, are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of Grant Park s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of Grant Park. Grant Park s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies may not be effective in either the short-or long-term and may change materially. 

Quantitative Market Risk 

Trading Risk 

Grant Park s approximate risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by its trading advisors is quantified below in terms of Value at Risk (VaR). Due to Grant Park s mark-to-market accounting, any loss in the fair value of Grant Park s open positions is directly reflected in Grant Park s earnings, realized or unrealized.  

Grant Park uses an Aggregate Returns Volatility method to calculate VaR for the portfolio. The method consists of creating a historical price time series for each instrument or its proxy instrument for the past 200 days, and then measuring the standard deviation of that return history. Then, using a normal distribution (a normal distribution curve has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one), the standard deviation measurement is scaled up in order to achieve a result in line with the 95% degree of confidence, which corresponds to a scaling factor of approximately 1.645 times of standard deviations. 

The VaR for each market sector represents the one day risk of loss for the aggregate exposures associated with that sector. The current methodology used to calculate VaR represents the VaR of Grant Park s open positions across all market sectors and is less than the sum of the VaR of the individual market sectors due to the diversification benefit across all market sectors combined. 

Grant Park s VaR methodology and computation is based on the underlying risk of each contract or instrument in the portfolio and does not distinguish between exchange and non-exchange traded contracts. It is also not based on exchange maintenance margin requirements. VaR does not typically represent the worst case outcome. 

44 

Table of Contents  

VaR is a measure of the maximum amount that Grant Park could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector in a given day; however, VaR does not typically represent the worst case outcome. The inherent uncertainty of Grant Park s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by Grant Park of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated value at risk or Grant Park s experience to date. This risk is often referred to as the risk of ruin. In light of the preceding information, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that Grant Park s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR or by Grant Park s attempts to manage its market risk. VaR models, including Grant Park s, are continually evolving as trading portfolios become more diverse and modeling systems and techniques continue to evolve. Moreover, value at risk may be defined differently as used by other commodity pools or in other contexts.  

The composition of Grant Park s trading portfolio, based on the nature of its business of speculative trading of futures, forwards and options, can change significantly, over any period of time, including a single day of trading. These changes can have a positive or negative material impact on the market risk as measured by VaR. 

Value at Risk by Market Sectors 

The following tables indicate the trading value at risk associated with Grant Park s open positions by market category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the trading gains/losses by market category for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015. All open position trading risk exposures of Grant Park, except for the swap transactions, have been included in calculating the figures set forth below. As of September 30, 2016, Grant Park s net asset value was approximately $181.7 million. As of December 31, 2015, Grant Park s net asset value was approximately $213.7 million. 

* The VaR for a market sector represents the one day risk of loss for the aggregate exposure for that particular sector. The aggregate VaR represents the VaR of Grant Park s open positions across all market sectors, excluding the swap transaction, and is less than the sum of the VaR of the individual market sectors due to the diversification benefit across all market sectors combined.

Material Limitations of Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk 

Past market risk factors will not always result in an accurate prediction of future distributions and correlations of future market movements. Changes in the portfolio value caused by market movements may differ from those measured by the VaR model. The VaR model reflects past trading positions, while future risk depends on future trading positions. VaR using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated within one day. The historical market risk data for the VaR model may provide only limited insight into the losses that could be incurred under unusual market movements. The magnitude of Grant Park s open positions creates a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of its positions, certain market conditions-unusual, but historically recurring from time to time-could cause Grant Park to incur severe losses over a short period of time. The value at risk table above, as well as the past performance of Grant Park, gives no indication of this risk of ruin. 

Non-Trading Risk 

Grant Park has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances, as well as the market risk they represent, are immaterial. Grant Park also has non-trading market risk as a result of investing a portion of its available assets in U.S. Treasury bills. The market risk represented by these investments is also immaterial. 

Qualitative Market Risk 

Trading Risk 

The following were the primary trading risk exposures of Grant Park as of September 30, 2016, by market sector.   

Stock Indices 

Grant Park s primary equity exposure is due to equity price risk in G-7 countries as well as other jurisdictions including Australia, the Eurozone, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.  The stock index futures contracts currently traded by Grant Park are generally futures on broadly based indices, although Grant Park also trades narrow-based stock index or single-stock futures contracts.  As of September 30, 2016, Grant Park was predominantly long equities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the Eurozone, Hong Kong, China, India,  Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S. and short equities in  Argentina, Columbia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Singapore and Israel.   

Interest Rates 

Interest rate risk is a principal market exposure of Grant Park.  Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the futures positions held by Grant Park and indirectly affect the value of its stock index and currency positions.  Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries materially impact Grant Park s profitability.  Grant Park s primary interest rate exposure is due to interest rate fluctuations in the United States and the other G-7 countries.  Grant Park also takes futures positions on the government debt of smaller nations, such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Mexico.  The general partner anticipates that G-7 interest rates will remain the primary market exposure of Grant Park for the foreseeable future.  As of September 30, 2016, Grant Park was long interest rate instruments in Australia, Canada, the Eurozone, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. and short interest rate instruments in Switzerland. 

Currencies 

Exchange rate risk is a significant market exposure of Grant Park.  Grant Park s currency exposure is due to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations that disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. These fluctuations are influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions.  Grant Park trades in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates, which are positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  The general partner anticipates that the currency sector will remain

one of the primary market exposures for Grant Park for the foreseeable future.  As of September 30, 2016, Grant Park was long the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Swiss franc and was short the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar. 

Agriculturals/Softs/Meats 

Grant Park s primary commodities risk exposure is driven by agricultural price movements, which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions as well as other factors.  As of September 30, 2016, in the grains markets, Grant Park had long exposure to coffee, cotton, crude palm, lumber, orange juice, rapeseed, rough rice, soybeans, soybean oil and sugar and Grant Park had short exposure to canola, cocoa, corn, feeder cattle, lean hogs, live cattle, red wheat, oats, robust coffee, rubber, soybean meal, white maize and wheat.     

Metals 

Grant Park s metals market risk exposure is due to fluctuations in the price of both precious metals, including gold and silver, as well as base metals including aluminum, lead, copper, tin, nickel, and zinc. As of September 30, 2016, in the precious metals sector Grant Park had long positions in gold and short positions in silver and platinum.  In the base metals, Grant Park had long positions in aluminum, lead, nickel, tin, palladium and zinc and short positions in copper.    

Energy 

Grant Park s primary energy market risk exposure is due to gas and oil price movements, often resulting from political developments in the Middle East, Nigeria, Russia, and South AmericaAs of September 30, 2016, in the energy market Grant Park had long exposure to Brent crude, heating oil, natural gas and Rotterdam coal and had short exposure to crude oil, carbon emissions, new crude oil, new gasoline, gas oil, U.K. natural gas and NY Harbor RBOB gas.   

Non-Trading Risk Exposure 

The following were the only non-trading risk exposures of Grant Park as of September 30, 2016. 

Foreign Currency Balances 

Grant Park s primary foreign currency balances are in Japanese yen, British pounds, euros and Australian dollars.  The trading advisors regularly convert foreign currency balances to U.S. dollars in an attempt to control Grant Park s non-trading risk. 

Managing Risk Exposure 

The general partner monitors and controls Grant Park s risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems and, accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which Grant Park is subject.  

The general partner monitors Grant Park s performance and the concentration of its open positions and consults with the trading advisors concerning Grant Park s overall risk profile. If the general partner felt it necessary to do so, the general partner could require the trading advisors to close out individual positions as well as enter positions traded on behalf of Grant Park. However, any intervention would be a highly unusual event. Approximately 2% to up to 15% of Grant Park s assets are deposited with over-the-counter counterparties in order to initiate and maintain forward and swap contracts.  The general partner primarily relies on the trading advisors  own risk control policies while maintaining a general supervisory overview of Grant Park s market risk exposures. The trading advisors apply their own risk management policies to their trading. The trading advisors often follow diversification guidelines, margin limits and stop loss points to exit a position. The trading advisors  research of risk management often suggests ongoing modifications to their trading programs.

Table of Contents  

As part of the general partner s risk management, the general partner periodically meets with the trading advisors to discuss their risk management and to look for any material changes to the trading advisors  portfolio balance and trading techniques. The trading advisors are required to notify the general partner of any material changes to their programs. 

General 

From time to time, certain regulatory or self-regulatory organizations have proposed increased margin requirements on futures contracts. Because Grant Park generally will use a small percentage of assets as margin, Grant Park does not believe that any increase in margin requirements, as proposed, will have a material effect on Grant Park s operations. 

ITEM 4.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the general partner carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the general partner s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Grant Park s disclosure controls and procedures as contemplated by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on, and as of the date of that evaluation, the general partner s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that Grant Park s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, in all material respects, in timely alerting them to material information relating to Grant Park required to be included in the reports required to be filed or submitted by Grant Park with the SEC under the Exchange Act. 

There were no changes in Grant Park s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Grant Park s internal control over financial reporting.
