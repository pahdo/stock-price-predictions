  Notes to Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements  
September 30, 2016 (Unaudited) 
 
	 Back to Table of Contents   

Note 1. Basis of Presentation   

  The Financial Statements presented herein have been
prepared by us in accordance with the accounting policies described in our June 30, 2016
audited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the notes to
financial statements which appear as part of those financial statements.  

  The preparation of these financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to
intangible assets, income taxes, insurance obligations and contingencies and litigation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other resources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.  

  In the opinion of Management, the information furnished
in these interim financial statements reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair
statement of the financial position and results of operations and cash flows as of and for
the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and therefore do not include some
information and notes necessary to conform with annual reporting requirements.   
	   Recently Issued Accounting
	Pronouncements   

On November 2014, The Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No.
	2014-16-Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host
	Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is
	More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task
	Force). The amendments in this Update do not change the current criteria in
	GAAP for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features
	in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will
	continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the
	embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the
	host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how
	current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic
	characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial
	instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially
	adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified
	retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the
	form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the
	amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all
	relevant prior periods. 
	 On November 2014, The Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-17 -
	Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting (a consensus of the
	FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this Update provide an
	acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate
	financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer
	obtains control of the acquired entity. The amendments in this Update are
	effective on November 18, 2014. After the effective date, an acquired entity
	can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control
	events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the
	financial statements for the period in which the most recent
	change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available
	to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in
	accounting principle. 

	 On August 2014, The Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-15,
	Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concerns (Subtopic 205-40):
	Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a
	Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity's
	ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon
	certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.
	Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term
	substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period
	including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the
	mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures
	when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of
	management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures
	when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for
	a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
	(or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for
	the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and
	interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. 
	 In June 2014, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12,
	Compensation -  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based
	Payments . When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could
	Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. The new guidance requires
	that share-based compensation that require a specific performance target to
	be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards
	and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service
	period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance
	target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of
	the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it
	becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should
	represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the
	requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target
	becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service
	period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized
	prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount
	of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service
	period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and
	should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The
	requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service
	and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is
	achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim
	periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption
	is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this Update either (a)
	prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or
	(b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are
	outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in
	the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The
	adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material impact on our
	financial position or results of operations. 
	 In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2014-10: Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
	Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable
	Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation , to improve
	financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the
	incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The
	amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting
	requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities, thereby
	improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity
	associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update
	also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic
	810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest
	entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The
	amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing
	avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the
	relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring
	the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting
	entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation
	analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a
	reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage.
	The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information
	and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be
	applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275, which
	shall be applied prospectively. For public companies, those amendments are
	effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014,
	and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of
	ASU 2014-10 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
	position or results of operations.  

Note 2. Earnings/Loss Per Share   

  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes
that any dilutive convertible securities outstanding were converted, with related
preferred stock dividend requirements and outstanding common shares adjusted accordingly.
It also assumes that outstanding common shares were increased by shares issuable upon
exercise of those stock options for which market price exceeds the exercise price, less
shares which could have been purchased by us with the related proceeds. In periods of
losses, diluted loss per share is computed on the same basis as basic loss per share as
the inclusion of any other potential shares outstanding would be anti-dilutive.  

  There were no common equivalent shares required to be
added back to the basic weighted average shares outstanding in order to compute the
diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  

Note 3. Related Party Transactions  

Due to Related Parties:   
	 Amounts due to related parties consist of corporate securities compliance
	services, corporate regulatory
	and administrative expenses paid or advanced for by our CEO. Such items due totaled $ 68,841  at September 30, 2016 and $63,511 at June 30, 2016  .
	Amounts due to related party are due on demand and bear interest of 8% per
	annum.  

During the three month-period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
	Company incurred $2,500 and $2,500, respectively, in corporate securities compliance services
	provided by our CEO.   

Accrued Interest on Related Parties Advances and Payable:    

During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
	Company incurred interest expense on advances made to the Company by its CEO
	of $1,373 and $1,060, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
	we had accrued interest of $7,765 and $6,392, respectively.   

Note 4. Stockholders' Equity   

Common Stock 

The certificate of incorporation authorize the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.0001. All issued shares of common stock are entitled to one vote per
share of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has 22,710,192 shares
of common stock issued and outstanding. 

Preferred Stock 

The certificate of incorporation authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. None are issued 

Stock Based Compensation 

There were no grants of employee or non-employee stock or options in either
period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note 5. Going Concern  

The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
	contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has
	not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs, and as
	such, has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of
	September 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its
	current business plan. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about
	the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
	financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
	future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
	amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible
	inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.       Note
	6. Subsequent Events  
	 The Company had no subsequent events after September 30, 2016 to the date
	the financial statements were issued.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION    
 Back to Table of Contents   

  Some of the statements contained in this quarterly
report of Kinder Holding Corp. (hereinafter the  Company ,  We 
or the  Registrant ) discuss future expectations, contain projections of our
plan of operation or financial condition or state other forward-looking information.
Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.
You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. They use of words such as  anticipate, 
 estimate,   expect,   project,   intend, 
 plan,   believe,  and other words and terms of similar meaning in
connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. From time to
time, we also may provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the
public.  

Overview   

   The Company's current
business objective is to seek a business combination with an operating company. We intend
to use the Company's limited personnel and financial resources in connection with such
activities.  The Company will utilize its capital stock, debt or a combination of
capital stock and debt, in effecting a business combination.  It may
be expected that entering into a business combination will involve the issuance of
restricted shares of capital stock.  The issuance of additional shares of our
capital stock:  

may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders; 
        will likely cause a
change in control if a substantial number of our shares of capital stock are issued, and
most likely will also result in the resignation or removal of our present officer and
director; and 
        may adversely affect
the prevailing market price for our common stock.  

  Similarly, if we issued debt securities, it
could result in: 
        default and
foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination were
insufficient to pay our debt obligations; 
        acceleration of our
obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest
payments when due if the debt security contained covenants that required the maintenance
of certain financial ratios or reserves and any such covenants were breached without a
waiver or renegotiations of such covenants; 
        our inability to
obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contained covenants
restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security was
outstanding.  

Results of Operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015  

 We have not generated any revenues during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. We had total operating
expenses of $5,330 related to general and administrative expenses during the

three months ended September 30, 2016  compared to $5,424 during the

same period in the prior year . We incurred interest expense of $1,373 during

three months ended September 30, 2016  compared to interest expense of $1,060 during the

three months ended September 30, 2015 . During the

three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , we had a net loss of $6,703 and $6,484,
respectively.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources   

 At present, the Company has no business operations and no
cash resources other than advances provided by our CEO. Our CEO and/or an affiliated party have
agreed to provide funding as may be required to pay for accounting fees and
other administrative expenses of the Company until such time the Company enters into a
business combination. The Company would be unable to continue as a going concern
without interim financing provided by our CEO. If we require additional
financing, we cannot predict whether equity or debt financing will become
available at terms acceptable to us, if at all. At present, the Company has no financial
resources to pay for such services and may be required to issue restricted
shares in lieu of cash or, in the alternative, issue debt instruments evidencing
financial obligations if and when they arise. 
	 
	 During the next 12 months we anticipate
	incurring costs related to:  

filing of Exchange Act reports. 
	      
 franchise fees, registered agent fees and accounting fees, and 
	      
 investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition or business
	combination.   

  On   September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we have had no assets.
As of September 30, 2016, we had $76,606
in liabilities consisting of accounts payable of $52,500 due to a related party,
advances from our CEO of $16,341 and accrued interest of $7,765 due to our CEO. As of June 30, 2016, we had liabilities of $69,903 consisting of $50,000 in
accounts payable due to our CEO, accrued interest due to our CEO
of $6,392 and advances from our CEO of $13,511.  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we
	had negative cash flow from operating activities of $5,330 due to a net loss
	of $6,703 offset by an increase in accrued interest of $1,373. We financed our
	negative cash flow from operations through advances provided to us by our
	CEO.

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we
	had negative cash flow from operating activities of $5,424 due to a net loss
	of $6,484 offset by an increase in accrued interest of $1,060. We financed our
	negative cash flow from operations through advances provided to us by our
	CEO.

The Company's limited resources and lack of having cash-generating business operations may
make it difficult to borrow funds or raise capital. The Company's limitations to borrow
funds or raise funds through the issuance of restricted capital stock required to effect
or facilitate a business combination may have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition and future prospects, including the ability to complete a business
combination. To the extent that debt financing ultimately proves to be available, any
borrowing will subject us to various risks traditionally associated with indebtedness,
including the risks of interest rate fluctuations and insufficiency of cash flow to pay
principal and interest, including debt of an acquired business.  
	 The Company currently plans to satisfy its cash
	requirements for the next 12 months through
	borrowings from its CEO or companies affiliated with its CEO and believes it can satisfy its cash requirements so
	long as it is able to obtain financing from these affiliated parties. The
	Company expects that money borrowed will be used during the next 12 months
	to satisfy the Company's operating costs, professional fees and for general
	corporate purposes.  

The Company has
