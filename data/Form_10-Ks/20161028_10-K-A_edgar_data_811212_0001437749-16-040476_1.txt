CORPORATE GOVERNANCE   
     
   General   
  Our Board of Directors believes that good corporate governance is important to ensure that Cesca Therapeutics Inc. is managed for the long-term benefit of our stockholders. This section describes key corporate governance guidelines and practices that we have adopted. Complete copies of our corporate governance guidelines, committee charters and code of ethical conduct described below are available under the investor information section of our website at www.cescatherapeutics.com.   
     
   Board Operating and Governance Guidelines    
  Our Board of Directors has adopted a number of operating and governance guidelines, including the following:  

-   
 
  Majority of the members of our Board of Directors should be independent directors;     

-   
 
  Formalization of the ability of each committee to retain independent advisors;     

-   
 
  Performance of an annual assessment of our Board of Director s performance by the Governance and Nominating Committee;     

-   
 
  Directors will have open access to the Company s management; and     

-   
 
  Independent directors may meet in executive session prior to or after each regularly scheduled Board meeting without management present.     
       
   Board Leadership Structure   
  Craig Moore, an independent director, serves as our Chairman of the Board. The Board has had the same individual serve as Chief Executive Officer and Board chairman in the past, but does not believe that structure to be the most desirable structure for the Company at this time. The Board views independent oversight of management as an important component of an effective board of directors and believes that a separated Chief Executive Officer and Chairman structure provides the Board with the greatest diversity of ideas and experience. The Chairman of the Board is responsible for coordinating the Board s activities, including the scheduling of meetings of the full Board, scheduling executive sessions of the non-employee directors and setting relevant items on the agenda (in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer as necessary or appropriate). The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day to day leadership and performance of the Company.   
       
   Risk Oversight   
    The Board has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing risk management. The Board regularly reviews information regarding the Company s liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Company s Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company s executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Audit Committee oversees management of risks relating to financial reporting, internal controls and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the management of risks associated with corporate governance, the independence of the Board of Directors and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.

The Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company s website at    www.cescatherapeutics.com   .

The Compensation Committee consists of three independent directors: Dr. Rao (Compensation Committee Chairman), Mr. Moore and Mr. Rhein.

Potential Payment  s upon Termination or Change in   Control   
    Our named executive officers have certain change of control rights under employment agreements or current company policy. The Compensation Committee considers these policies to provide the named executive officers with the ability to make appropriate, informed decisions on strategy and direction of the Company that may adversely impact their particular positions, but nevertheless are appropriate for the Company and its stockholders. Our Compensation Committee believes that companies should provide reasonable severance benefits to employees, recognizing that it may be difficult for them to find comparable employment within a short period of time and that severance arrangements may be necessary to attract highly qualified officers in a competitive hiring environment.  
     
  The following table describes the potential payments upon a hypothetical termination without cause, resignation for good reason or due to a change in control of the Company on June 30, 2016 for the NEOs. The actual amounts that may be paid upon an executive s termination of employment can only be determined at the actual time of such termination.  

(1)   
 
  In July 2016, the Compensation Committee adopted a short term incentive plan under which the NEOs were granted cash awards and shares of common stock. The cash awards will be payable and the shares of common stock will fully vest on July 1, 2017 provided that the NEO is employed by the Company as of such date. If the NEO is terminated without cause prior to July 1, 2017 the cash and shares vest immediately. Mr. Stracey was awarded $85,000 and 29,720 shares of stock. Mr. Bruch was awarded $45,000 and 15,734 shares of stock and Ms. Ellner was awarded $37,170 and 12,997 shares of stock.     

(2)   
 
  For purposes of this calculation, we used the closing price of our Common Stock on June 30, 2016 which was $2.93. The estimated value of accelerated vesting for outstanding stock options is zero for all options in which the exercise price exceeded the closing price of our Common Stock as of June 30, 2016.     

(3)   
 
  Payable in a lump-sum payment.     

(4)   
 
  Payable in biweekly installments over nine months.     

(5)   
 
  If we terminate the executive s employment without cause, or if the executive resigns for good reason as defined, in either case within three (3) months prior to a Change of Control or within one (1) year following a Change of Control, then they would be entitled to receive the amounts listed as shown in the table. The salary and incentive compensation components are payable in a lump-sum payment.
