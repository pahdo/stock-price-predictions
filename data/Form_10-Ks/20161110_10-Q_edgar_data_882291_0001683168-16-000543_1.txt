1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

ORGANIZATION 

Aethlon Medical, Inc. and subsidiary ( Aethlon , the  Company ,
 we  or  us ) is a medical device company focused on creating innovative devices that address unmet medical
needs in cancer, infectious disease and other life-threatening conditions. At the core of our developments is the Aethlon ADAPT 
(Adaptive Dialysis-Like Affinity Platform Technology) system, a medical device platform that converges single or multiple affinity
drug agents with advanced plasma membrane technology to create therapeutic filtration devices that selectively remove harmful particles
from the entire circulatory system without loss of essential blood components. On June 25, 2013, the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) that allows us to initiate human feasibility studies of
the Aethlon Hemopurifier  in the U.S. Under the feasibility study protocol, we plan to enroll ten end-stage renal disease patients
who are infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) to demonstrate the safety of Hemopurifier therapy. Successful completion of this
study will allow us the opportunity to initiate pivotal studies that are required for market clearance to treat HCV and other disease
conditions in the U.S. 

Successful outcomes of human trials will also be required by the
regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we intend to sell this device. Some of our patents may expire before FDA
approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain patent applications and/or other
patents issued more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of the Hemopurifier(R) treatment technology. 

In October 2013, our majority owned subsidiary, Exosome Sciences,
Inc. ( ESI ), commenced operations with a focus on advancing exosome-based strategies to diagnose and monitor the progression
of cancer, infectious disease and other life-threatening conditions. 

ESI is accounted for as a non-controlling interest as the Company
has an 80% ownership interest in the subsidiary. Earnings or losses attributable to other stockholders of a consolidated affiliated
company are classified separately as  noncontrolling interest  in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects only its share of the after-tax earnings or losses of an affiliated company.
Income taxes attributable to noncontrolling interest are determined using the applicable statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions
where such operations are conducted. The Company's consolidated balance sheets reflect noncontrolling interests within the equity
section of the consolidated balance sheets. 

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the
symbol  AEMD.  

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, there have been
no changes to our significant accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2016. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto
for the year ended March 31, 2016, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2016.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aethlon Medical, Inc. and its
majority-owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the
opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company at September
30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, and the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016. Estimates were made relating to
useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowances, the fair value of warrants, impairment of assets, share-based
compensation expense and accruals for clinical trial and research and development expenses. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. Certain amounts previously reported in the financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect net loss, equity or cash flows. The accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet at March
31, 2016, contained in the above referenced 10-K. The results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods. 

On April 14, 2015, we completed a 1-for-50 reverse stock split.
Accordingly, authorized common stock was reduced from 500,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares, and each 50 shares of outstanding
common stock held by stockholders were combined into one share of common stock. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively revised to reflect such reverse stock split as if it had occurred on
April 1, 2015. All share and per share amounts have been revised accordingly. 

On March 31, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles
of Incorporation to increase our authorized common stock from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 shares. Our stockholders approved the amendment
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on March 29, 2016. 

LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We have incurred continuing losses from operations and at September
30, 2016 had limited working capital and an accumulated deficit of approximately $90,887,000. These factors, among other matters,
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A significant amount of additional capital will be necessary
to advance the development of our products to the point at which they may become commercially viable. We intend to fund operations,
working capital and other cash requirements for the twelve month period subsequent to September 30, 2016 through debt and/or equity
financing arrangements as well as through revenues and related cash receipts under our government contracts (see Note 11). 

We are currently addressing our liquidity issue by seeking additional
investment capital through issuances of common stock under our existing S-3 registration statement and by applying for grants issued
by government agencies in the United States. We believe that our cash on hand and funds expected to be received from additional
debt and equity financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the twelve month period through September
30, 2017. However, no assurance can be given that we will receive any funds in addition to the funds we have received to date (see
Note 14). 

The successful outcome of future activities cannot be determined
at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business plan or
generate positive operating results. 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to this uncertainty and as to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

2. LOSS PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period of computation. The weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 includes 184,500 vested restricted
stock units that have not yet been issued. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator
is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares had
been issued, if such additional common shares were dilutive. Since we had net losses for all periods presented, basic and diluted
loss per share are the same, and additional potential common shares have been excluded as their effect would be antidilutive. 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, a total of 3,289,606 and 2,773,483
potential common shares, consisting of shares underlying outstanding stock options, warrants, unvested restricted stock units and
convertible notes payable were excluded as their inclusion would be antidilutive. 

3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES 

Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We
incurred research and development expenses during the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which are
included in various operating expense line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Our research
and development expenses in those periods were as follows: 

4. SIGNIFICANT RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03, the new accounting standard
on imputation of interest, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. As a result of the adoption of that pronouncement,
our deferred financing costs at March 31, 2016 were reclassified from current assets to an offset against our convertible notes. 

Management is evaluating significant recent accounting pronouncements
that are not yet effective for us, including the new accounting standard on improvements to employee share based payment accounting,
ASU 2016-09 (Topic 718), the new accounting standard related to leases, ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842), the new accounting standard for
recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, ASU 2016-01, the new accounting standard on extraordinary
and unusual items on income statements, ASU 2015-01, the new accounting standard related to presentation of financial statements
- going concern qualifications, ASU 2014-15, and the new accounting standard on revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09 (Topic 606), and
have not yet concluded whether any such pronouncements will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 

5. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 

Convertible Notes Payable consisted of the following at September
30, 2016: 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded interest
expense of $30,794 related to the contractual interest rates of our convertible notes, interest expense of $27,641 related to the
amortization of deferred financing costs and interest expense of $18,998 related to the amortization of the note discount for a
total interest expense of $77,433 related to our convertible notes in the six months ended September 30, 2016. All of the unamortized
discount at September 30, 2016 related to the note discount established upon the second amendment to the notes (see below). 

Convertible Notes Payable consisted of the following at March 31,
2016 (our most recent fiscal year end): 

The above table shows the retroactive application of $27,641 in
note discounts representing the deferred financing costs of that same amount on March 31, 2016 due to the application of related
to the application of the new accounting standard ASU 2015-03. All of the unamortized discount at March 31, 2016 related to the
deferred financing costs noted above. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded interest
expense of $26,390 related to the contractual interest rates of our convertible notes, interest expense of $186,276 related to
the amortization of debt discount and interest expense of $39,441 related to the amortization of deferred financing costs for a
total interest expense of $252,107 related to our convertible notes in the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

NOVEMBER 2014 10% CONVERTIBLE NOTES 

In November 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement with
two accredited investors providing for the issuance and sale of (i) convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount
of $527,780 (the  Notes ) and (ii) five year warrants to purchase up to 47,125 shares of common stock at a fixed exercise
price of $8.40 per share (the  Warrants ). These Notes bear interest at the annual rate of 10% and originally matured
on April 1, 2016. 

The aggregate gross cash proceeds to us were $415,000 after subtracting
legal fees of $35,000, a $27,780 due diligence fee and an original issuance discount of $50,000. We recorded deferred financing
costs of $112,780 to reflect the legal fees, due diligence fee and original issuance discount and will amortize those costs over
the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. 

These Notes are convertible at the option of the holders into shares
of our common stock at a fixed price of $5.60 per share, for up to an aggregate of 94,246 shares of common stock. There are no
registration requirements with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the Notes or the Warrants. 

The estimated relative fair value of Warrants issued in connection
with the Notes was recorded as a debt discount and is amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying
debt. We recorded debt discount of $240,133 based on the relative fair value of these Warrants. In addition, as the effective conversion
price of the Notes was less than market price of the underlying common stock on the date of issuance, we recorded an additional
debt discount of $287,647 related to the beneficial conversion feature. 

Initial Amendment of the November 2014 10% Convertible Note Terms  

On November 12, 2015, we entered into an amendment of terms ( Amendment
of Terms ) with the two investors that participated in the November 2014 10% Convertible Notes. The Amendment of Terms modified
the terms of the subscription agreement, Notes and Warrants held by those investors to, among other things, extended the maturity
date of the Notes from April 1, 2016 to June 1, 2016, temporarily reduced the number of shares that we must reserve with respect
to conversion of the Notes, and temporarily suspended the time period during which one of the investors may exercise its Warrants.
In exchange for the investors  agreements in the Amendment of Terms, we paid one of the investors a cash fee of $90,000,
which we recorded as deferred financing costs and amortized over the remaining term of the notes. 

Second Amendment and Extension of the November 2014 10% Convertible
Notes  

On June 27, 2016, we and certain investors entered into further
Amendments (the  Amendments ) to the Notes and the Warrants. The Amendments provide that the Maturity Date (as defined
in the Notes) was extended from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2017 and that the conversion price per share of the Notes was reduced from
$5.60 per share of common stock to $5.00 per share of common stock. In addition, we reduced the purchase price (as defined in the
Warrants) from $8.40 per share to $5.00 per share of common stock. In connection with these modifications, each of the investors
signed a Consent and Waiver providing its consent under certain restrictive provisions, and waiving certain rights, including a
right to participate in certain offerings made by us, under a Securities Purchase Agreement dated June 23, 2015, (the  2015
SPA ) to which we, the investors and certain other investors are parties, in order to facilitate an at-the-market equity
program (see Note 6). 

The Amendments also increase the principal amount of the Notes to
$692,811 (in the aggregate) to (i) include accrued and unpaid interest through June 15, 2016, and (ii) increase the principal
amount by $80,000 (in the aggregate) as an extension fee for the extended maturity date of the Notes. With respect to each Note,
we entered into an Allonge to Convertible Promissory Note (each, an  Allonge ) reflecting the changes in the principal
amount, Maturity Date and conversion price of the Note. 

We also issued to the investors new warrants (the  New Warrants )
to purchase an aggregate of 30,000 shares of common stock with a Purchase Price (as defined in the New Warrants) of $5.00 per share
of common stock. We issued the New Warrants in substantially the same form as the prior Warrants, and the New Warrants will expire
on November 6, 2019, the same date on which the prior Warrants will expire. 

The modification of the Notes was evaluated under FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic No. 470-50-40,  Debt Modification and Extinguishments . Therefore,
according to the guidance, the instruments were determined to be substantially different, and the transaction qualified for extinguishment
accounting. As a result, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $536,889 and recognized and an extension fee expense of $80,000,
which are included in other expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The debt extinguishment
is comprised from the fair value of prior warrants issued in connection with the Notes of $287,676, as well as $325,206 related
to beneficial conversion feature and offset by debt discount of $75,993. The beneficial conversion feature is a result of the effective
conversion price of the new Notes being less than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of modification. 

The following table shows the changes to the principal balance of
the November 2014 10% Convertible Notes: 

6. EQUITY TRANSACTIONS IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 

Common Stock Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright  

On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Common Stock Sales Agreement
(the  Agreement ) with H.C. Wainwright   Co., LLC ( H.C. Wainwright ) which establishes an at-the-market
equity program pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time as set forth in the Agreement.
The Agreement provides for the sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $12,500,000 (the
 Shares ). 

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement,
H.C. Wainwright will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the
Shares from time to time, based upon our instructions. We have provided H.C. Wainwright with customary indemnification rights,
and H.C. Wainwright will be entitled to a commission at a fixed rate equal to three percent (3.0%) of the gross proceeds per Share
sold. In addition, we have agreed to pay certain expenses incurred by H.C. Wainwright in connection with the Agreement, including
up to $50,000 of the fees and disbursements of their counsel. The Agreement will terminate upon the sale of all of the Shares under
the Agreement unless terminated earlier by either party as permitted under the Agreement (see Note 14). 

Sales of the Shares, if any, under the Agreement shall be made in
transactions that are deemed to be  at the market offerings  as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including
sales made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions, including on the Nasdaq Capital Market, at market prices or as otherwise
agreed with H.C. Wainwright. We have no obligation to sell any of the Shares, and, at any time, we may suspend offers under the
Agreement or terminate the Agreement. 

In July 2016, we commenced sales of common stock under our Common
Stock Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had raised net proceeds of $266,612
(net of $8,348 in commissions to H.C. Wainwright and $3,319 in other offering expenses) utilizing the sales agreement through the
sale of 50,163 shares at an average price of $5.31 per share of net proceeds. 

Warrant Issuances in July 2016   

In July 2016, we issued an aggregate of 2,660 shares of common stock
to three investors upon the exercise of previously issued warrants. The warrants were exercised on a cashless or  net 
basis. Accordingly, we did not receive any proceeds from such exercises. The cashless exercise of such warrants resulted in the
cancellation of previously issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 19,563 shares of common stock. 

Restricted Stock Unit Grants to Directors and Executive Officers  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, 30,131 Restricted
Stock Units ( RSUs ) held by our outside directors were exchanged into the same number of shares of our common stock
(see Note 9). 

Amendment of November 2014 10% Convertible Notes  

Under the Second Amendment and Extension of the November
2014 10% Convertible  Notes dated June 27, 2016 (See Note 5), we reduced the purchase price of 47,125 Warrants from $8.40 per
share to $5.00 per share.   

We also issued to the investors new warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 30,000 shares of common stock with a purchase price of $5.00 per share of common stock. We issued the new warrants in substantially
the same form as the prior Warrants, and the new warrants will expire on November 6, 2019, the same date on which the prior warrants
will expire (See Note 5). 

Amendment of December 2014 Warrants  

On June 27, 2016, we and certain investors (the  Unit Investors )
entered into Consent and Waiver and Amendment agreements (the  CWAs ), relating to an aggregate of 264,000 Warrants
to Purchase Common Stock (the  Unit Warrants ) we had issued to the Unit Investors on December 2, 2014 pursuant to
a Securities Purchase Agreement dated November 26, 2014 (the  2014 SPA ). In the CWAs, each of the Unit Investors provided
its consent under certain restrictive provisions, and waived certain rights, including a right to participate in certain offerings
made by us, under the 2014 SPA in order to facilitate the at-the-market equity program described above. Pursuant to the CWAs, we
reduced the Exercise Price (as defined in the Unit Warrants) from $15.00 per share of common stock to $5.00 per share of common
stock. At any time that the shares of common stock underlying the Unit Warrants are covered by an effective registration statement
that permits the public resale of the shares, if the Unit Investors exercise the Unit Warrants, they must do so by a cash exercise,
which could yield up to $1,320,000 in proceeds to us. 

On June 27, 2016, each of the Unit Investors also entered into a
Consent and Waiver providing its consent under certain provisions, and waiving certain rights, including a right to participate
in certain offerings made by us, under the 2015 SPA in order to facilitate the at-the market equity program described above. 

In accordance with GAAP, we measured the change in fair value that
arose from the reduction in exercise price and recognized an expense of $345,841, which is included in other expenses in the accompanying
condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

DUE TO RELATED PARTIES 

Historically, certain of our officers and other related parties
have advanced us funds, agreed to defer compensation and/or paid expenses on our behalf to cover working capital deficiencies.
There were no such related party transactions during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 except that we had accrued unpaid Board
fees of $86,000 owed to our outside directors as of March 31, 2016. At September 30, 2016, we had unpaid Board fees of $28,250. 

8. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 

Other current liabilities were comprised of the following items: 

9. STOCK COMPENSATION  

The following tables summarize share-based compensation expenses
relating to Restricted Stock Units ( RSU s) and options granted and the effect on basic and diluted loss per common
share during the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

All of the stock-based compensation expense recorded during the
six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which totaled $1,573,991 and $101,421, respectively, is included in payroll and related
expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Stock-based compensation expense recorded during
the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  represented an impact on basic and diluted loss per common share of $(0.20)
in both periods. 

We review share-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes
to the estimate of expected award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture
rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The effect of forfeiture adjustments
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was insignificant. 

Restricted Stock Unit Grants to Directors and Executive Officers  

On August 9, 2016, our Board of Directors (the  Board )
granted RSUs to certain of our officers and directors as set forth below. The RSUs represent the right to be issued on a future
date shares of our common stock for vested RSUs. Our Compensation Committee recommended the grants based on a compensation assessment
provided by a third-party compensation consulting firm engaged by us that developed a peer group of companies for market assessment
and analyzed compensation at such companies.  

The consultant recommended beneficial ownership targets, which we
previously disclosed in our Proxy Statement filed on February 23, 2016, in connection with our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held
on March 29, 2016. In connection with the Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved our Amended 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, which
included an increase in the number of shares available for grant under the plan in part to accommodate equity awards recommended
by the Compensation Committee, and our stockholders approved our executive compensation as disclosed in the Proxy Statement pursuant
to Item 402 paragraphs (m) through (q) of Regulation S-K. 

To Mr. James A. Joyce, an aggregate of 634,000 RSUs valued at $6.28
per share, based on the August 9, 2016 closing price of the common stock. 158,500 of the RSUs are deemed vested upon grant and
an additional 39,625 RSUs will vest each quarter beginning on January 1, 2017. This grant is intended to increase Mr. Joyce s
beneficial ownership of our common stock to 9.0%, which target was recommended in 2015 and in June 2016 by the compensation consultant
engaged by us. Previously, in 2004, the Board had approved a beneficial ownership target of 15% for Mr. Joyce. However, Mr. Joyce
has agreed to the modified target of 9.0%. 

To Mr. Rodney S. Kenley, an aggregate of 52,000 RSUs valued at $6.28
per share, based on the August 9, 2016 closing price of the common stock. 13,000 of the RSUs are deemed vested upon grant and an
additional 3,250 RSUs will vest each quarter beginning on January 1, 2017. 

To Mr. James B. Frakes, an aggregate of 52,000 RSUs valued at $6.28
per share, based on the August 9, 2016 closing price of the common stock. 13,000 of the RSUs are deemed vested upon grant and an
additional 3,250 RSUs will vest each quarter beginning on January 1, 2017. 

To each of our non-employee directors, Mr. Franklyn S. Barry, Jr.,
Mr. Edward G. Broenniman and Dr. Chetan S. Shah, 16,432 RSUs valued at an aggregate of $105,000, based on the average of the closing
prices of the common stock for the five trading days preceding and including August 9, 2016. These grants represent (a) $70,000
worth of RSUs representing two years of grants under the amended 2012 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Program (the  2012
Program ) because more than two years have elapsed since Messrs. Barry and Broenniman and Dr. Shah received grants under
the program, all of which RSUs are deemed vested upon grant and (b) $35,000 worth of RSUs representing the grant covering the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2017, of which one-quarter are deemed vested upon grant and the remaining portion will vest ratably at September
30, 2016, at December 31, 2016 and at March 31, 2017. 

The RSUs were granted under our Amended 2010 Stock Incentive Plan
and we recorded expense of $1,523,280 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the RSU grants. 

Changes to 2012 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Program  

In July 2012, the Board approved the 2012 Program, which modified
and superseded the 2005 Directors Compensation Program that had been in effect previously. On June 6, 2014, the Board approved
certain changes to the 2012 Program, and on August 9, 2016, the Board approved further modifications to the program. Under the
modified 2012 Program, in which only non-employee directors may participate, a new eligible director will receive an initial grant
of $50,000 worth of RSUs or, at the discretion of the Board, options to acquire shares of Common Stock. RSUs granted under this
provision will be valued based on the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock for the five trading days preceding and
including the date of grant and will vest at a rate determined by the Board in its discretion. Options granted under this provision
will be valued at the exercise price, which will be based on the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock for the five
trading days preceding and including the date of grant. Such options will have a term of ten years and will vest at a rate determined
by the Board in its discretion. 

At the beginning of each fiscal year, each existing director eligible
to participate in the 2012 Program will receive a grant of $35,000 worth of RSUs or, at the discretion of the Board, options to
acquire shares of Common Stock. RSUs granted under this provision will be valued based on the average of the closing prices of
the Common Stock for the five trading days preceding and including the first day of the fiscal year (or preceding and including
the date of grant, if such grant is not made on the first day of the fiscal year) and will vest at a rate determined by the Board
in its discretion. Options granted under this provision will be valued at the exercise price, which will be based on the average
of the closing prices of the Common Stock for the five trading days preceding and including the first day of the fiscal year (or
preceding and including the date of grant, if such grant is not made on the first day of the fiscal year). Such options will have
a term of ten years and will vest at a rate determined by the Board in its discretion. 

In lieu of per meeting fees, under the 2012 Program eligible
directors will receive an annual Board retainer fee of $30,000. The modified 2012 Program also provides for the following
annual retainer fees: Audit Committee Chair - $5,000, Compensation Committee chair - $5,000, Nominating Committee Chair -
$5,000, Audit Committee member - $4,000, Compensation Committee member - $4,000 and Lead independent director (currently
an open position) - $15,000. 

The RSU grants and the changes to the 2012 Program were approved
and recommended by our Compensation Committee prior to approval by the Board.  

RSUs outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest as of
September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, 30,131 RSUs held
by our outside directors were exchanged into the same number of shares of our common stock. As two of our three outside directors
elected to return 40% of their RSU s in exchange for cash in order to pay their withholding taxes on the share issuances,
10,957 of the RSUs were cancelled and we paid a total of $67,343 in cash to those two outside directors. 

Stock Option Activity  

There were no stock option grants during the six months ended September
30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. 

Options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest as
of September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

There was no stock option activity during the six months ended September
30, 2016 other than the expiration of 4,000 stock options during the period. 

On September 30, 2016, our stock options had no intrinsic value
since the closing price on that date of $5.02 per share was below the weighted average exercise price of our stock options. 

At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $3,509,367 of unrecognized
compensation cost related to share-based payments, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.87 years. 

10. WARRANTS 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 30,000
warrants with an exercise price of $5.00 per share. Those warrants were issued in connection with the Amendment of November
2014 Investment Documents (see Note 6). 

A summary of warrant activity during the six months ended September
30, 2016 is presented below: 

The following outlines the significant weighted average assumptions
used to estimate the fair value information presented, with respect to warrants utilizing the Binomial Lattice option pricing models
at, and during the six months ended September 30, 2016: 

Risk free interest rate  
      0.70%     
 
      Average expected life   
      3.5 years   
 
      Expected volatility    
      91.5%   
 
      Expected dividends   
      None   

The expected volatility was based on the historic volatility. The
expected life of options granted was based on the  simplified method  as described in the SEC's guidance due to changes
in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants. 

Based on the above assumptions, we valued the 30,000 new warrants
issued during the six months ended September 30, 2016 at $111,900 and classified that fair value as equity. 

11. DARPA CONTRACT AND RELATED REVENUE RECOGNITION 

We entered into a contract with the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, or DARPA, on September 30, 2011. Under the DARPA award, we have been engaged to develop a therapeutic device
to reduce the incidence of sepsis, a fatal bloodstream infection that often results in the death of combat-injured soldiers.
The award from DARPA was a fixed-price contract with potential total payments to us of $6,794,389 over the course of five
years. Fixed price contracts require the achievement of multiple, incremental milestones to receive the full award during
each year of the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we performed certain incremental work towards the achievement of
specific milestones against which we invoiced the government for fixed payment amounts. 

Originally, only the base year (year one of the contract) was effective
for the parties; however, DARPA subsequently exercised its option on the remaining years of the contract. The milestones were comprised
of planning, engineering and clinical targets, the achievement of which in some cases required the participation and contribution
of third party participants under the contract. We commenced work under the contract in October 2011. 

In February 2014, DARPA reduced the scope of our contract in years
three through five of the contract. The reduction in scope focused our research on exosomes, viruses and blood processing instrumentation.
This scope reduction reduced the possible payments under the contract by $858,469 over years three through five. 

In the six months ended September 30, 2016, we invoiced the U.S.
Government for the final two milestones under our DARPA contract in the aggregate amount of $387,438. 

The details of those milestones were as follows: 

Milestone 2.6.1.3 - Quantify the degree to which the MERS virus
can be extracted from circulation in vitro using miniature Hemopurifiers. The milestone payment was $193,719. Management considers
this milestone to be substantive as it was not dependent on the passage of time nor was it based solely on another party's efforts.
We quantified the degree to which the MERS virus can be extracted from circulation in vitro using miniature Hemopurifiers. The
report was accepted by the contracting officer's representative and the invoice was submitted thereafter. 

Milestone 2.6.1.4   Prepare and present Final Report for DARPA.
The milestone payment was $193,719. Management considers this milestone to be substantive as it was not dependent on the passage
of time nor was it based solely on another party's efforts. We prepared and presented the Final Report for DARPA. The report was
accepted by the contracting officer's representative and the invoice was submitted thereafter. 

In the six months ended September 30, 2015, we invoiced the U.S.
Government for two milestones under our DARPA contract in the amount of $372,328. 

The details of those milestones were as follows: 

Milestone M6   Define Aethlon s GMP manufacturing process
and revise and upgrade Aethlon s quality procedures and policies to the current state of the art. The milestone payment was
$186,164. Management considers this milestone to be substantive as it was not dependent on the passage of time nor was it based
solely on another party's efforts. We demonstrated that defined our GMP manufacturing process and that we revised and upgraded
our quality procedures and policies to the current state of the art for a company of our size. The report was accepted by the contracting
officer's representative and the invoice was submitted thereafter. 

Milestone 2.5.1.1 - Complete Aethlon s GMP procedure and establish
and maintain all GMP documentation for the company. The milestone payment was $186,164. Management considers this milestone to
be substantive as it was not dependent on the passage of time nor was it based solely on another party's efforts. We demonstrated
that we completed our GMP procedures and established and maintained all GMP documentation for the company. The report was accepted
by the contracting officer's representative and the invoice was submitted thereafter. 

12. SEGMENTS 

We operate our businesses principally through two reportable segments:
Aethlon, which represents our therapeutic business activities, and ESI, which represents our diagnostic business activities. Our
reportable segments have been determined based on the nature of the potential products being developed. We record discrete financial
information for ESI and our chief operating decision maker reviews ESI s operating results in order to make decisions about
resources to be allocated to the ESI segment and to assess its performance. 

Aethlon s revenue is generated primarily from government contracts
to date and ESI does not yet have any revenues. We have not included any allocation of corporate overhead to the ESI segment. 

The following tables set forth certain information regarding our
segments: 

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

LEASE COMMITMENTS 

We currently rent approximately 2,600 square feet of executive office
space at 9635 Granite Ridge Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92123 at the rate of $6,054 per month on a four-year lease that expires
in January 2019. We also rent approximately 1,700 square feet of laboratory space at 11585 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 109, San
Diego, California 92121 at the rate of $4,394 per month on a one-year lease that was recently extended to an expiration date of
November 30, 2017. 

Our Exosome Sciences, Inc. subsidiary previously rented approximately
2,055 square feet of office and laboratory space at 11 Deer Park Drive, South Brunswick, NJ at the rate of $3,917 per month on
a one-year lease that expired in October 2015. In October 2015, ESI relocated to a different suite at the same office complex.
That new suite was comprised of approximately 541 square feet of office and laboratory space and is located at 9 Deer Park Drive,
South Brunswick, NJ at the rate of $1,352 per month under a month to month lease basis. In January 2016, we exercised our 30-day
notice to terminate the ESI lease in New Jersey as part of a consolidation of our laboratory operations in San Diego and the ESI
lease was terminated effective February 29, 2016. 

Rent expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses,
approximated $79,000 and $90,000 for the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

LEGAL MATTERS 

From time to time, claims are made against us in the ordinary course
of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable
outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more products
or engaging in other activities. 

The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any specific period
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. We are not presently a party
to any pending or threatened legal proceedings. 

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Management has evaluated events subsequent to September 30, 2016
through the date that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for transactions and other events which may require adjustment of and/or disclosure in such financial statements. 

In October 2016, we collected $193,719 from DARPA. That amount had
been invoiced to DARPA for the achievement of a milestone in September 2016 and was classified as an account receivable as of September
30, 2016. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we continued selling common stock
under our Common Stock Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright (see Note 6). Between the period of October 1, 2016 through November
8, 2016, we raised net proceeds of $61,265 (after deducting $1,919 in commissions to H.C. Wainwright and $799 in other offering
expenses) utilizing the sales agreement through the sale of 13,261 shares at an average price of $4.62 per share of net proceeds. 

On October 5, 2016, we entered into an amendment of the lease for
our laboratory space at 11585 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 109, San Diego, California 92121. Pursuant to the amendment, the lease
term will be extended to November 30, 2017 and the rent will be $4,394 per month. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the condensed consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This item contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included
in this Form 10-Q are, or may be deemed to be,  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Such forward-looking
statements involve assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance,
or achievements of Aethlon Medical, Inc. ( we  or  us ) to be materially different from any future results,
performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. Such potential
risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, completion of our capital-raising activities, U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
or FDA, approval of our products, other regulations, patent protection of our proprietary technology, product liability exposure,
uncertainty of market acceptance, competition, technological change, and other risk factors detailed herein and in other of our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ). The forward-looking statements are made as
of the date of this Form 10-Q, and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual
results could differ from those projected in such forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We are a medical device company focused on creating innovative devices
that address unmet medical needs in cancer, infectious disease and other life-threatening conditions. At the core of our developments
is the Aethlon ADAPT  (Adaptive Dialysis-Like Affinity Platform Technology) system, a medical device platform that converges
single or multiple affinity drug agents with advanced plasma membrane technology to create therapeutic filtration devices that
selectively remove harmful particles from the entire circulatory system without loss of essential blood components. 

In June 2013, the FDA approved our investigational device exemption
application to initiate a ten-patient human clinical trial in one location in the U.S. to treat dialysis patients who are infected
with the Hepatitis C virus. The principal investigator of that clinical trial recently began recruiting patients. Successful outcomes
of that human trial as well as at least one follow-on human trial will be required by the FDA in order to commercialize our products
in the U.S. The regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we intend to sell this device will also require one or more
human clinical trials. 

Some of our patents may expire before we receive FDA approval to
market our products in the U.S. or we receive approval to market our products in a foreign country. However, we believe that certain
patent applications and/or other patents issued more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of the Hemopurifier treatment
technology. 

Through Exosome Sciences, Inc. (ESI), our majority-owned subsidiary,
we are also studying potential diagnostic techniques for identifying and monitoring neurological conditions and cancer. We consolidate
ESI s activities in our consolidated financial statements. 

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the
symbol  AEMD.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

Revenues 

We recorded government contract revenue in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.  This revenue arose from work performed under our government contract with the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and our subcontract with Battelle Memorial Institute as follows: 

DARPA Contract  

We entered into a contract with DARPA on September 30, 2011. Under
the DARPA award, we have been engaged to develop a therapeutic device to reduce the incidence of sepsis, a fatal bloodstream infection
that often results in the death of combat-injured soldiers. The award from DARPA was a fixed-price contract with potential total
payments to us of $6,794,389 over the course of five years. Fixed price contracts require the achievement of multiple, incremental
milestones to receive the full award during each year of the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we performed certain incremental
work towards the achievement of specific milestones against which we invoiced the government for fixed payment amounts. 

Originally, only the base year (year one of the contract) was effective
for the parties; however, DARPA subsequently exercised its option on the remaining years of the contract. The milestones were comprised
of planning, engineering and clinical targets, the achievement of which in some cases required the participation and contribution
of third party participants under the contract. We commenced work under the contract in October 2011. 

In February 2014, DARPA reduced the scope of our contract in years
three through five of the contract. The reduction in scope focused our research on exosomes, viruses and blood processing instrumentation.
This scope reduction reduced the possible payments under the contract by $858,469 over years three through five. 

In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we invoiced the U.S.
Government for the final two milestones under our DARPA contract in the aggregate amount of $387,438. In the three months ended
September 30, 2015, we invoiced the U.S. Government for one milestone under our DARPA contract in the amount of $186,164. 

Operating Expenses 

Consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $2,614,116 in comparison with $1,312,727 for the comparable quarter a year ago.  This increase of $1,301,389,
or 99.1%, was due to increases in payroll and related expenses of $1,215,153 and in professional fees of $121,775, which were partially
offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses of $35,539. 

The $1,215,153 increase in payroll and related expenses was due
to a $1,472,570 increase in stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by a $257,417 decrease in cash-based compensation.
The increase in stock-based compensation was the result of the RSU grants to our officers and directors in the three months ended
September 30, 2016. 

The $121,775 increase in our professional fees was primarily due
to an increase in our non-DARPA-related professional fees of $144,307, which was partially offset by decreases in our DARPA-related
professional fees of $22,166 and in our professional fees at ESI of $366. The $144,307 increase in our non-DARPA-related professional
fees was due to a $112,596 increase in scientific consulting fees, a $51,000 increase in business development expenses, a $9,665
increase in our accounting fees, a $7,127 increase in investor relations fees and a $5,942 increase in our public relations fees,
which were partially offset by a $43,044 decrease in legal fees. 

The $35,539 decrease in general and administrative expenses was
the result of decreases of $59,065 in our non-DARPA-related general and administrative expenses and of $31,945 in our general and
administrative expenses at ESI, which were partially offset by a $55,470 increase in our DARPA-related general and administrative
expenses.  

Other Expense 

Other expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 consisted of interest expense. Interest expense was $36,576 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $127,245
in the corresponding prior period, a decrease of $90,669. The various components of our interest expense are shown in the following
table: 

As noted in the above table, the most significant factor in the
$90,669 decrease in interest expense was the $74,140 decrease in the amortization of note discounts, which related to the amortization
against the discount on the convertible notes that we issued in November 2014. Other smaller factors in the change in our total
interest were a $20,139 decrease in the amortization of deferred financing costs and a $3,610 increase in our contractual interest
expense. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses noted above,
our net loss before noncontrolling interests increased from approximately $1,252,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to
approximately $2,263,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Basic and diluted loss attributable to common stockholders was ($0.29)
for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and ($0.16) for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. 

SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

Revenues 

We recorded government contract revenue in the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. This revenue arose from work performed under our government contract with the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, or DARPA, and our subcontract with Battelle Memorial Institute as follows: 

DARPA Contract  

We entered into a contract with DARPA on September 30, 2011. Under
the DARPA award, we have been engaged to develop a therapeutic device to reduce the incidence of sepsis, a fatal bloodstream infection
that often results in the death of combat-injured soldiers. The award from DARPA was a fixed-price contract with potential total
payments to us of $6,794,389 over the course of five years. Fixed price contracts require the achievement of multiple, incremental
milestones to receive the full award during each year of the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we performed certain incremental
work towards the achievement of specific milestones against which we invoiced the government for fixed payment amounts. 

Originally, only the base year (year one of the contract) was effective
for the parties; however, DARPA subsequently exercised its option on the remaining years of the contract. The milestones were
comprised of planning, engineering and clinical targets, the achievement of which in some cases required the participation and
contribution of third party participants under the contract. We commenced work under the contract in October 2011. 

In February 2014, DARPA reduced the scope of our contract in years
three through five of the contract. The reduction in scope focused our research on exosomes, viruses and blood processing instrumentation.
This scope reduction reduced the possible payments under the contract by $858,469 over years three through five. 

In the six months ended September 30, 2016, we invoiced the U.S.
Government for the final two milestones under our DARPA contract in the aggregate amount of $387,438. In the six months ended September
30, 2015, we invoiced the U.S. Government for two milestones under our DARPA contract in the amount of $372,328. 

Operating Expenses 

Consolidated operating expenses for the six months ended September
30, 2016 were $3,750,602 in comparison with $2,595,206 for the comparable quarter a year ago. This increase of $1,155,396,
or 44.5%, was due to increases in payroll and related expenses of $1,102,112 and in professional fees of $151,298, which were partially
offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $98,014. 

The $1,102,112 increase in payroll and related expenses was primarily
due to a $1,472,570 increase in stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by a $370,458 decrease in cash-based compensation.
The increase in stock-based compensation was due to the RSU grants to our officers and directors in the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

The $151,298 increase in our professional fees was primarily due
to an increase in our non-DARPA-related professional fees of $202,114, which was partially offset by a reduction in our professional
fees at ESI of $4,918 and in our DARPA-related professional fees of $45,898. The $202,114 increase in our non-DARPA-related professional
fees was due to a $160,924 increase in scientific consulting fees, an $85,000 increase in business development expenses, an $8,851
increase in investor relations fees and a $5,942 increase in our public relations fees, which were partially offset by a decreases
of $39,909 in accounting fees and $19,953 in legal fees. 

The $98,014 decrease in general and administrative expenses was
primarily due to decreases of $103,221 in our non-DARPA-related general and administrative expenses and of $49,373 in the general
and administrative expenses at ESI, which were partially offset by an increase of $54,580 in our DARPA-related general and administrative
expenses.   

Other Expense 

Other expense during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 consisted primarily of losses on debt extinguishment, warrant repricing expense and interest expense. Other expense for the
six months ended September 30, 2016 was other expense of $1,041,473 in comparison with other expense of $253,933 for the six months
ended September 30, 2015. 

The following table breaks out the various components of our other
expense for both periods: 

Loss on Debt Extinguishment 

This loss on debt extinguishment arose from the Amendments (the
 Amendments ) to our November 2014 convertible notes The Amendments provided that the maturity date of the notes was
extended from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2017 and that the conversion price was reduced from $5.60 per share of common stock to $5.00
per share of common stock. In addition, we reduced the purchase price of warrants issued in connection with the notes from $8.40
per share to $5.00 per share. In connection with these modifications, each of the Investors signed a consent and waiver providing
its consent under certain restrictive provisions, and waiving certain rights, including a right to participate in certain offerings
made by us, under a securities purchase agreement dated June 23, 2015, (the  2015 SPA ) to which we, the Investors
and certain other investors are parties, in order to facilitate an at-the-market equity program described in the liquidity and
capital resources section of this report below. This loss also included an $80,000 fee to extend the November 2014 convertible
notes from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2017. The $80,000 amount was not a cash payment but rather was added to the principal of the
notes. 

Loss on Warrant Repricing 

On June 27, 2016, we and certain investors (the  Unit Investors )
entered into Consent and Waiver and Amendment agreements (the  CWAs ), relating to an aggregate of 264,000 Warrants
to Purchase Common Stock (the  Unit Warrants ) we had issued to the Unit Investors on December 2, 2014 pursuant to
a Securities Purchase Agreement dated November 26, 2014 (the  2014 SPA ). In the CWAs, each of the Unit Investors provided
its consent under certain restrictive provisions, and waived certain rights, including a right to participate in certain offerings
made by us, under the 2014 SPA in order to facilitate the at-the-market equity program described in the notes to the Financial
Statements. Pursuant to the CWAs, we reduced the Exercise Price (as defined in the Unit Warrants) from $15.00 per share of common
stock to $5.00 per share of common stock. 

On June 27, 2016, each of the Unit Investors also entered into a
Consent and Waiver providing its consent under certain provisions, and waiving certain rights, including a right to participate
in certain offerings made by us, under the 2015 SPA in order to facilitate the at-the market equity program described in the notes
to the Financial Statements. 

We measured the change in fair value that arose from the reduction
in exercise price from $15.00 to $5.00 and recorded a charge of $345,841 to our other expense to reflect this change. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was $78,743 for the six months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $253,933 in the corresponding prior period, a decrease of $175,190. The various components of our interest
expense are shown in the following table: 

As noted in the above table, the most significant factor in the
$175,190 decrease in interest expense was the $167,278 decrease in the amortization of note discounts, which related to the amortization
against the discount on the convertible notes that we issued in November 2014. Other smaller factors in the change in our total
interest were an $11,800 decrease in the amortization of deferred financing costs and a $3,888 increase in our contractual interest
expense. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses noted above,
our net loss before noncontrolling interests increased from approximately $2,468,000 in the six month period ended September 30,
2015 to approximately $4,400,000 for the six month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Basic and diluted loss attributable to common stockholders were
($0.57) for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to ($0.34) for the period ended September 30, 2015. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $556,352 and negative
working capital of $267,681. This compares to a cash balance of $2,123,737 and working capital of $1,849,891 at March 31, 2016.
The primary reason that we had negative working capital at September 30, 2016 was the presentation of $605,815 in convertible notes
as a current liability rather than as a long term liability as we did at March 31, 2016 since those notes have an expiration date
of July 1, 2017, which is less than one year from the September 30, 2016 balance sheet date. 

Significant additional financing must be obtained in order to provide
a sufficient source of operating capital and to allow us to continue to operate as a going concern. In addition, we will need to
raise capital to complete the approved human clinical trial in the U.S. We anticipate the primary source of this additional financing
will be from proceeds of our at-the-market offering program. 

We raised $5,591,988 in net proceeds from a financing in June 2015.
That amount, coupled with previously existing funds on hand and revenues from our government contracts, has financed our operations
through the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. However, we will require significant additional financing
to complete the current and expected additional future clinical trials in the U.S., as well as fund all of our continued research
and development activities for the Hemopurifier and products on our Aethlon ADAPT platform through the twelve month period ending
June 30, 2017. In addition, as we expand our activities, our overhead costs to support personnel, laboratory materials and infrastructure
will increase. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable to us on reasonable terms, if
at all, when we require it, we may be unable to support our research and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance activities
including our planned clinical trials. The failure to implement our research and clearance activities would have a material adverse
effect on our ability to commercialize our products. 

Future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including
progress with pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, the number and breadth of our clinical programs, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, the time and costs involved
in obtaining regulatory approvals, competing technological and market developments, as well as our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, effective commercialization, marketing activities and other arrangements. We expect to continue to incur increasing
negative cash flows and net losses for the foreseeable future. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We have incurred continuing losses from operations and at September
30, 2016 had limited working capital and an accumulated deficit of approximately $90,887,000. These factors, among other matters,
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A significant amount of additional capital will be necessary
to advance the development of our products to the point at which they may become commercially viable. We intend to fund operations,
working capital and other cash requirements for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2017 through debt and/or equity financing
arrangements as well as through revenues and related cash receipts under our government contracts. 

We are currently addressing our liquidity issue by seeking additional
investment capital through issuances of common stock under our existing S-3 registration statement and by applying for additional
grants issued by government agencies in the United States. We believe that our cash on hand and funds expected to be received from
additional debt and equity financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for fiscal 2017. However, no assurance
can be given that we will receive any funds in addition to the funds we have received to date (see Note 14). 

In July 2016, we commenced sales of common stock under our Common
Stock Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright. We raised $266,612 under that sales agreement during the three months ended September
30, 2016 (after deducting $8,348 in commissions to H.C. Wainwright and $3,319 in other offering expenses) through the sale of 50,163
shares at an average price of $5.31 per share of net proceeds. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we continued selling common stock
under our Common Stock Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright (see Note 6). Between the period of October 1, 2016 through November
8, 2016, we raised net proceeds of $61,265 (after deducting $1,919 in commissions to H.C. Wainwright and $799 in other offering
expenses) utilizing the sales agreement through the sale of 13,261 shares at an average price of $4.62 per share of net proceeds. 

In October 2016, we collected $193,719 from DARPA. That amount had
been invoiced to DARPA for the achievement of a milestone in September 2016 and was classified as an account receivable as of September
30, 2016. 

The successful outcome of future activities cannot be determined
at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business plan or
generate positive operating results. 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to this uncertainty and as to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Cash Flows 

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as
reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: 

NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES. We used cash in our operating
activities due to our losses from operations. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,763,000 in the six months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,238,000 in the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $475,000. 

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. We used approximately $3,000
of cash to purchase office equipment and fixtures in the six months ended September 30, 2016. There were no investing activities
in the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. In the six months
ended September 30, 2015 we raised approximately $5,592,000 through the sale of common stock. We raised approximately
$267,000 through the sale of common stock in the six months ended September 30, 2016, which was partially offset by
approximately $67,000 in cash paid for tax withholding on vested rights, for total cash from financing activities of
approximately $199,000. 

At the date of this filing, we plan to invest significantly into
purchases of our raw materials and into our contract manufacturing arrangement subject to successfully raising additional capital. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and
circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ
from these estimates under different future conditions. 

We believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important
to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These critical accounting policies relate
to revenue recognition, measurement of stock purchase warrants issued with notes payable, beneficial conversion feature of convertible
notes payable, impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets, stock compensation, and the classification of warrant obligations,
and evaluation of contingencies. We believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate
under the circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences, there could be a material
impact on our future financial condition or results of operations. 

There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies as
disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no obligations required to be disclosed herein as off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required
to provide the information requested by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording,
processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, claims are made against us in the ordinary course
of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable
outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more products
or engaging in other activities. 

The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any specific period
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. We are not presently a party
to any pending or threatened legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required
to provide the information requested by this item. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and subsequent thereto
through the date of filing this report, we issued the following securities which were not registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. We did not employ any form of general solicitation or advertising in connection with the offer and sale of the
securities described below. In addition, we believe the purchasers are  accredited investors  for the purpose of Rule
501 promulgated under the Securities Act. For these reasons, among others, the offer and sale of the following securities were
made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated
by the Commission under the Securities Act. 

On July 26, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 2,660 shares of common
stock to three investors upon the exercise of previously issued warrants. The warrants were exercised on a cashless or  net 
basis. Accordingly, we did not receive any proceeds from such exercises. The cashless exercise of such warrants resulted in the
cancellation of previously issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 19,563 shares of common stock. 

On August 12, 2016, we issued 6,464 shares of common stock to the
holder of a convertible note in exchange for the partial conversion of principal and interest in the aggregate amount of $32,321
at a conversion price of $5.00 per share. 

On September 1, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 27,122 shares of
common stock to our three outside directors in settlement of an aggregate of 27, 122 restricted stock units, or RSUs, previously
granted to them, which RSUs vested on August 9, 2016. On September 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 3,010 shares of common stock
to our three outside directors in settlement of an aggregate of 3,010 RSUs previously granted to them, which RSUs vested on September
30, 2016.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  

  Statement of Work  

Aethlon Medical, Inc.  

  DATE: 23 September 2011  

TITLE: Broad Spectrum Countermeasures for Viral and Bacterial
Sepsis using Dialysis-Like Devices  

1. Scope  

The scope of this effort is to use Aethlon s ADAPT System
as the core technology within an extracorporeal blood purification device that would simultaneously remove: viruses, virally-derived
immunosuppressive glycoproteins, and multiple classes of exosomes; complement activation, activation of virus growth (e.g. cytomegalovirus)
and TLR activation, all of which have implications to the promotion of the well-being and recovery of wounded warfighters and the
prevention of sepsis. 

1.1 Introduction  

This effort will use the adaptable dialysis-like platform (ADAPT)
technology that allows for the selective removal of harmful agents from the entire circulatory system. This revolutionary advance
overcomes the limitation of devices that indiscriminately adsorb or solely capture particles by molecule size. The platform will
provide an expansive therapeutic filtration mechanism to immobilize multiple affinity agents directed toward precursors to sepsis,
bacterial toxins, viral pathogens, and disease enhancing particles transported by exosomes. To insure benefit to wounded warfighters,
this effort will advance an innovative strategy that will allow therapy administration without systemic anticoagulation. 

The ADAPT platform has been previously used to create a broad-spectrum
antiviral device that immobilized one lectin affinity agent, resulting in the effective capture of all tested Category A pathogens,
as well as exosomes underlying tuberculosis and cancer. In human studies, this same device, known as the Hemopurifier, consistently
provided greater than 50% average viral load reductions during four-hour treatment periods in both hepatitis-C and HIV infected
individuals without antiviral drug therapy. 

The resulting device would save thousands of military and civilian
lives each year. Each of these technology advancements will be integrated into a single cartridge that will provide decision-free
and life-saving medical care for the wounded warfighter. 

1.2 Background  

The goal of the DLT program is to develop a portable device that
removes  dirty  blood from the body, separates harmful agents, and returns  clean  blood to the body in
a manner similar to dialysis treatment of kidney failure. While the device could have an impact across multiple areas of medicine,
the target application for this device is sepsis. The envisioned device can also provide early identification of the presence
of a pathogen. Once the presence of pathogens has been confirmed, the DLT device will provide continuous  label-free 
removal of pathogens, toxins and activated patient cells without pathogen identification or use of pathogen-specific binding chemistries.
As a final step in the treatment process, the DLT device will enable closed-loop therapy based on continuous, reduced dimensionality
modeling of patient health. Predictive modeling in this fashion will allow us to identify sepsis early, learn what we need to
remove, and direct the most effective intervention to improve patient health. This cycle of sensing, adjustment, estimation, computation,
and manipulation will modulate key health parameters faster than the underlying disease process and drive the patient towards
a stable, healthy state.

2. Technical Requirements  

2.1 Human and Animal use  

Human use  is  anticipated in this effort, specifically
related to the use of human blood. The contractor shall obtain all necessary Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, show proper
assurance documentation, and obtain proper approval from the Government officials prior to human use testing. Funds associated
with human subjected testing shall not be released until IRB documentation has been provided to SSC s HRPO and approval to
release funds has been obtained. 

Animal use  is  anticipated in this effort. The
contractor shall obtain all necessary Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC) approval and demonstrate this
approval to the Government ( both  ACURO and SSC-Pacific) prior to beginning experimentation with animals. If animal use is
no longer anticipated, or changes significantly from the approved IACUC then the Principal Investigator (PI) must submit a letter
stating the discontinuation of animal use for this effort and/or receive appropriate authorization for IACUC changes of previously
specified protocols. Unless prior approval by DARPA is given IACUC documentation must be provided prior to contract award. 

2.2 Base Effort (Year 1)  

2.2.1 Subtask 1a: Anticoagulant-free Hemopurification
Device    

2.2.1.1    Write requirements definition for the extracorporeal blood purification system and
acquire necessary equipment. 

2.2.1.2    Fabricate breadboard prototypes for anticoagulation-free anti-sepsis extracorporeal
system (ASEPSYS) device. Fabricate prototype blood tubing sets. Acquire anti-thrombogenic surface-modified hollow fiber plasma
separators. 

2.2.1.3    Assemble and test breadboard ASEPSYS devices  ex vivo  with bovine blood. The
test will most likely be conducted using a porcine model where the elapsed time to reach a pre-defined degree of clotting in the
blood treatment device will be compared between the new device and two control groups; one using standard anticoagulant therapy
and one using none. Determine contribution of the following techniques and approaches to eliminating anticoagulants: 
 
(1) Backflushing at regular intervals, (2) Turbo
loop, (3) Continuous pre-dilution loop using re-captured hydration fluid, (4) Linear vs pulsatile blood flow, (5) Elimination
of air/blood interfaces in extracorporeal circuit, (6) Anti-thrombogenic derivatized plasma separation membrane, and (7) Ultra-short
half-life anticoagulant nafamostat mesilate. 

2.2.1.4    IRB Documentation Generation: The contractor shall obtain all necessary IRB documentation
and obtain both institutional and Government (SSC-Pacific) approval in accordance with IRB documentation submission guidance prior
to conducting human subject testing. 

Milestones

or clotting in at least a 2 hour blood pumping experiment at 100 mL/hr blood flow. 

2.2.2 Subtask 2: Removal of Sepsis Precursors   

2.2.2.1    Begin to develop a device based on Aethlon s ADAPT system to efficiently capture
sepsis precursors identified as potentially important in killing patients undergoing sepsis. The strategy is takes advantage of
the flexibility and rapidity of modification of our ADAPT platform system to test any sepsis precursor candidates that circulate
in the blood. The sepsis precursors that will be targeted are shown in Table I, in order of importance. No test for the removal
of bacterial toxins. No testing for removal of cytokines, since the evidence to date does not support a role for them in death
due to sepsis. Additional factors may become known during the grant period and those will also be tested as time and budget permit.

EXAMPLE 1: Employee s
one way commuting distance to regular place of work is 7 miles. Employee drives from residence to an alternate work site, a distance
of 18 miles. Upon completion of work, employee returns to residence, a distance of 18 miles. 

In this case, the employee
is entitled to be reimbursed for the distance that exceeds the normal round trip commuting distance (14 miles). The employee is
reimbursed for 22 miles (18 + 18 - 14 = 22).  

EXAMPLE 2: Employee s one way commuting
distance to regular place of work is 15 miles. Employee drives from residence to an alternate work site, a distance of 5 miles.
Upon completion of work, employee returns to residence, a distance of 5 miles. 

In this case, the employee
is not entitled to be reimbursed for the travel performed (10 miles), since the distance traveled is less than the commuting distance
(30 miles) to the regular place of work.  

 EXAMPLE 3: Employee s one way commuting
distance to regular place of work is 15 miles. Employee drives to regular place of work. Employee is required to travel to an alternate
work site, a distance of 30 miles. Upon completion of work, employee returns to residence, a distance of 15 miles. 

In this case, the employee
is entitled to be reimbursed for the distance that exceeds the normal round trip commuting distance (30 miles). The employee is
reimbursed for 30 miles (15 + 30 + 15 - 30 = 30).  

EXAMPLE 4: Employee s one way commuting
distance to regular place of work is 12 miles. In the morning the employee drives to an alternate work site (45 miles). In the
afternoon the employee returns to the regular place of work (67 miles). After completion of work, employee returns to residence,
a distance of 12 miles. 

In this case, the employee
is entitled to be reimbursed for the distance that exceeds the normal round trip commuting distance (24 miles). The employee is
reimbursed for 100 miles (45 + 67 + 12 - 24 = 100).  

EXAMPLE 5: Employee s one way commuting
distance to regular place of work is 35 miles. Employee drives to the regular place of work (35 miles). Later, the employee drives
to alternate work site #1 (50 miles) and then to alternate work site #2 (25 miles). Employee then drives to residence (10 miles). 

In this case, the employee
is entitled to be reimbursed for the distance that exceeds the normal commuting distance (70 miles). The employee is reimbursed
for 50 miles (35 + 50 + 25 + 10 - 70 = 50).  

EXAMPLE 6: Employee s one way commuting
distance to regular place of work is 20 miles. Employee drives to the regular place of work (20 miles). Later, the employee drives
to alternate work site #1 (10 miles) and then to alternate work site #2 (5 miles). Employee then drives to residence (2 miles). 

In this case, the employee
is not entitled to be reimbursed for the travel performed (37 miles), since the distance traveled is less than the commuting distance
(40 miles) to the regular place of work.

(End of clause) 

52.232-32 PERFORMANCE-BASED PAYMENTS (AUG 2010) 

(a) Amount of payments and limitations on payments.
Subject to such other limitations and conditions as are specified in this contract and this clause, the amount of payments and
limitations on payments shall be specified in the contract's description of the basis for payment. 

(b) Contractor request for performance-based payment. The Contractor
may submit requests for payment of performance-based payments not more frequently than monthly, in a form and manner acceptable
to the Contracting Officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all performance-based payments in any period
for which payment is being requested shall be included in a single request, appropriately itemized and totaled. The Contractor's
request shall contain the information and certification detailed in paragraphs (l) and (m) of this clause. 

(c) Approval and payment of requests. 

(1)  
 The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of a request for performance-based payment prior to successful accomplishment
of the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested. The Contracting Officer shall determine whether the event
or performance criterion for which payment is requested has been successfully accomplished in accordance with the terms of the
contract. The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require the Contractor to substantiate the successful performance of any event
or performance criterion which has been or is represented as being payable. 

(2)  
 A payment under this performance-based payment clause is a contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of
this contract and not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. The designated payment office will
pay approved requests on the 30th day after receipt of the request for performance-based payment by the designated payment office.
However, the designated payment office is not required to provide payment if the Contracting Officer requires substantiation as
provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or inquires into the status of an event or performance criterion, or into any of the
conditions listed in paragraph (e) of this clause, or into the Contractor certification. The payment period will not begin until
the Contracting Officer approves the request. 

(3)  
 The approval by the Contracting Officer of a request for performance-based payment does not constitute an acceptance by
the Government and does not excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract. 

(d) Liquidation of performance-based payments. 

(1)  
 Performance-based finance amounts paid prior to payment for delivery of an item shall be liquidated by deducting a percentage
or a designated dollar amount from the delivery payment. If the performance-based finance payments are on a delivery item basis,
the liquidation amount for each such line item shall be the percent of that delivery item price that was previously paid under
performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar amount. If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole contract
basis, liquidation shall be by either predesignated liquidation amounts or a liquidation percentage. 

(2)  
 If at any time the amount of payments under this contract exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall
repay to the Government the excess. Unless otherwise determined by the Contracting Officer, such excess shall be credited as a
reduction in the unliquidated performance-based payment balance(s), after adjustment of invoice payments and balances for any retroactive
price adjustments.

(ii)  
 Unsatisfactory financial condition. 

(3) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of any
subcontractor or supplier under this contract in the ordinary course of business. 

(f) Title. 

(1) Title to the property described in this paragraph
(f) shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the date of the first performance-based payment under this
contract, for property acquired or produced before that date. Otherwise, vestiture shall occur when the property is or should have
been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract 

(2)  Property,  as used in this clause, includes all
of the following described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or should be allocable or properly chargeable
to this contract under sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices:

manufacturing aids, title to which would not be obtained as special tooling under subparagraph (f)(2)(ii) of this clause; and 

(iv)  
 Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government
by other clauses of this contract. 

(3) Although title to property is in the Government
under this clause, other applicable clauses of this contract (e.g., the termination or clauses) shall determine the handling and
disposition of the property. 

(4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from
production under this contract, without requesting the Contracting Officer's approval, provided that any significant reduction
in the value of the property to which the Government has title under this clause is reported in writing to the Contracting Officer. 

(5) In order to acquire for its own use or dispose of property
to which title is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval
of the action and the terms. If approved, the basis for payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related
shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for
performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. 

(6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations
under this contract, including liquidation of all performance-based payments, title shall vest in the Contractor for all property
(or the proceeds thereof) not --

for Government-furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government acquired title solely under this clause. 

(g) Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government,
the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to
the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed, the basis of payment
(the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of
the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related
performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. 

(h) Records and controls. The Contractor shall maintain
records and controls adequate for administration of this clause. The Contractor shall have no entitlement to performance-based
payments during any time the Contractor's records or controls are determined by the Contracting Officer to be inadequate for administration
of this clause. 

(i) Reports and Government access. The Contractor
shall promptly furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other pertinent information requested by the Contracting
Officer for the administration of this clause and to determine that an event or other criterion prompting a financing payment has
been successfully accomplished. The Contractor shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to examine and verify the Contractor's
records and to examine and verify the Contractor's performance of this contract for administration of this clause. 

(j) Special terms regarding default. If this contract is terminated
under the Default clause, 

(1)  
 the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated performance-based payments, and 

(2)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 

SECTION C - DESCRIPTIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS 

The following have been
modified:  STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  

Aethlon Medical,
Inc. 

DATE: 11 December 2013,  Revised:
12 March 2015   

TITLE: Broad Spectrum Countermeasures
for Viral and Bacterial Sepsis using Dialysis-Like Devices  

The scope of this effort is
to use Aethlon s Hemopurifier as the core technology within an extracorporeal blood purification device that would simultaneously
remove: viruses, virally-derived immunosuppressive glycoproteins, and multiple classes of exosomes; complement activation, activation
of virus growth (e.g. cytomegalovirus) and TLR activation, all of which have implications to the promotion of the well-being and
recovery of wounded warfighters and the prevention of sepsis. 

This effort will create an
adaptable dialysis-like platform (ADAPT) technology that allows for the selective removal of harmful agents from the entire circulatory
system. This revolutionary advance overcomes the limitation of devices that indiscriminately adsorb or solely capture particles
by molecule size. The platform will provide an expansive therapeutic filtration mechanism to immobilize multiple affinity agents
directed toward precursors to sepsis, bacterial toxins, viral pathogens, and disease enhancing particles transported by exosomes.
To insure benefit to wounded warfighters, this effort will advance an innovative strategy that will allow therapy administration
without systemic anticoagulation. 

The ADAPT
platform has been shown previously to create a broad-spectrum antiviral device that immobilized one lectin affinity agent, resulting
in the effective capture of all tested Category A pathogens, as well as exosomes underlying tuberculosis and cancer. In human studies,
this same device, known as the Hemopurifier, consistently provided greater than 50% average viral load reductions during four-hour
treatment periods in both hepatitis-C and HIV infected individuals without antiviral drug therapy. 

The resulting device would
save thousands of military and civilian lives each year. Each of these technology advancements will be integrated into a single
cartridge that will provide decision-free and life-saving medical care for the wounded warfighter. 

The goal of the DLT
program is to develop a portable device that removes  dirty  blood from the body, separates harmful agents, and
returns  clean  blood to the body in a manner similar to dialysis treatment of kidney failure. While the device
could have an impact across multiple areas of medicine, the target application for this device is sepsis. The envisioned
device will persistently interrogate the entire blood volume, providing early identification of the presence of a pathogen.
Once the presence of pathogens has been confirmed, the DLT device will provide continuous  label-free  removal of
pathogens, toxins and activated patient cells without pathogen identification or use of pathogen-specific binding
chemistries. As a final step in the treatment process, the DLT device will enable closed-loop therapy based on continuous,
reduced dimensionality modeling of patient health. Predictive modeling in this fashion will allow us to identify sepsis
early, learn what we need to remove, and direct the most effective intervention to improve patient health. This cycle of
sensing, adjustment, estimation, computation, and manipulation will modulate key health parameters faster than the underlying
disease process and drive the patient towards a stable, healthy state. 

2.0  Technical Requirements   

Human use  is  anticipated
in this effort, specifically related to the use of human blood. The grantee shall obtain all necessary Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approvals, show proper assurance documentation, and obtain proper approval from the Government officials prior to human use
testing. Funds associated with human subjected testing shall not be released until IRB documentation has been provided to SSC s
HRPO and approval to release funds has been obtained. 

Animal use  is  anticipated
in this effort. The contractor shall obtain all necessary Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC) approval
and demonstrate this approval to the Government ( both  ACURO and SSC-Pacific) prior to beginning experimentation with animals.
If animal use is no longer anticipated, or changes significantly from the approved IACUC then the Principal Investigator (PI) must
submit a letter stating the discontinuation of animal use for this effort and/or receive appropriate authorization for IACUC changes
of previously specified protocols. Unless prior approval by DARPA is given IACUC documentation must be provided prior to contract
award. 

2.2.1     Subtask 1a: Anticoagulant-free Hemopurification Device     

2.2.1.1  Write requirements definition for the extracorporeal blood purification
system and acquire necessary equipment.   

2.2.1.2  Fabricate breadboard prototypes for anticoagulation-free anti-sepsis extracorporeal
system (ASEPSYS) device. Fabricate prototype blood tubing sets. Acquire anti-thrombogenic surface-modified hollow fiber plasma
separators.   

2.2.1.3  Assemble and test breadboard ASEPSYS devices  ex vivo  with bovine blood.
The test will most likely be conducted using a porcine model where the elapsed time to reach a pre-defined degree of clotting in
the blood treatment device will be compared between the new device and two control groups; one using standard anticoagulant therapy
and one using none. Determine contribution of the following techniques and approaches to eliminating anticoagulants:   

 (1)   
 Backflushing at regular intervals, (2) Turbo loop, (3) Continuous pre-dilution loop using re-captured hydration fluid, (4)
Linear vs pulsatile blood flow, (5) Elimination of air/blood interfaces in extracorporeal circuit, (6) Anti-thrombogenic derivatized
plasma separation membrane, and (7) Ultra-short half-life anticoagulant nafamostat mesilate. 

2.2.1.4  IRB Documentation Generation: The contractor shall obtain all necessary
IRB documentation and obtain both institutional and Government (SSC-Pacific) approval in accordance with IRB documentation submission
guidance prior to conducting human subject testing.   

Milestones   

 M1:
Demonstrate the effectiveness of the prototype device in preventing platelet activation or clotting in at least a 2 hour blood
pumping experiment at 100 mL/hr blood flow. 

2.2.2.1  Begin to develop a device based on Aethlon s ADAPT system to efficiently
capture sepsis precursors identified as potentially important in killing patients undergoing sepsis. The strategy is takes advantage
of the flexibility and rapidity of modification of our ADAPT platform system to test any sepsis precursor candidates that circulate
in the blood. The sepsis precursors that will be targeted are shown in Table I, in order of importance. No test for the removal
of bacterial toxins. No testing for removal of cytokines, since the evidence to date does not support a role for them in death
due to sepsis. Additional factors may become known during the grant period and those will also be tested as time and budget permit.

STATEMENT
OF WORK (SOW)  

 Aethlon Medical, Inc. 

DATE: 12 March 2015; Modified:  15
July 2016   

TITLE: Broad Spectrum Countermeasures
for Viral and Bacterial Sepsis using Dialysis-Like Devices  

The scope of this effort is to use Aethlon s
Hemopurifier as the core technology within an extracorporeal blood purification device that would simultaneously remove: viruses,
virally-derived immunosuppressive glycoproteins, and multiple classes of exosomes; complement activation, activation of virus growth
(e.g. cytomegalovirus) and TLR activation, all of which have implications to the promotion of the well-being and recovery of wounded
warfighters and the prevention of sepsis. 

This effort will create an adaptable dialysis-like
platform (ADAPT) technology that allows for the selective removal of harmful agents from the entire circulatory system. This revolutionary
advance overcomes the limitation of devices that indiscriminately adsorb or solely capture particles by molecule size. The platform
will provide an expansive therapeutic filtration mechanism to immobilize multiple affinity agents directed toward precursors to
sepsis, bacterial toxins, viral pathogens, and disease enhancing particles transported by exosomes. To insure benefit to wounded
warfighters, this effort will advance an innovative strategy that will allow therapy administration without systemic anticoagulation. 

 The ADAPT platform
has been shown previously to create a broad-spectrum antiviral device that immobilized one lectin affinity agent, resulting in
the effective capture of all tested Category A pathogens, as well as exosomes underlying tuberculosis and cancer. In human studies,
this same device, known as the Hemopurifier, consistently provided greater than 50% average viral load reductions during four-hour
treatment periods in both hepatitis-C and HIV infected individuals without antiviral drug therapy. 

The resulting device would save thousands
of military and civilian lives each year. Each of these technology advancements will be integrated into a single cartridge that
will provide decision-free and life-saving medical care for the wounded warfighter. 

The goal of the DLT program is to
develop a portable device that removes  dirty  blood from the body, separates harmful agents, and returns
 clean  blood to the body in a manner similar to dialysis treatment of kidney failure. While the device could
have an impact across multiple areas of medicine, the target application for this device is sepsis. The envisioned device
will persistently interrogate the entire blood volume, providing early identification of the presence of a pathogen. Once the
presence of pathogens has been confirmed, the DLT device will provide continuous  label-free  removal of pathogens,
toxins and activated patient cells without pathogen identification or use of pathogen-specific binding chemistries. As a
final step in the treatment process, the DLT device will enable closed-loop therapy based on continuous, reduced
dimensionality modeling of patient health. Predictive modeling in this fashion will allow us to identify sepsis early, learn
what we need to remove, and direct the most effective intervention to improve patient health. This cycle of sensing,
adjustment, estimation, computation, and manipulation will modulate key health parameters faster than the underlying disease
process and drive the patient towards a stable, healthy state. 

2.0  Technical Requirements   

Human use  is  anticipated in this
effort, specifically related to the use of human blood. The grantee shall obtain all necessary Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals, show proper assurance documentation, and obtain proper approval from the Government officials prior to human use testing.
Funds associated with human subjected testing shall not be released until IRB documentation has been provided to SSC s HRPO
and approval to release funds has been obtained. 

Animal use  is  anticipated in this
effort. The contractor shall obtain all necessary Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC) approval and demonstrate
this approval to the Government ( both  ACURO and SSC-Pacific) prior to beginning experimentation with animals. If animal
use is no longer anticipated, or changes significantly from the approved IACUC then the Principal Investigator (PI) must submit
a letter stating the discontinuation of animal use for this effort and/or receive appropriate authorization for IACUC changes of
previously specified protocols. Unless prior approval by DARPA is given IACUC documentation must be provided prior to contract
award. 

2.2.1     Subtask 1a: Anticoagulant-free Hemopurification Device     

2.2.1.1  Write requirements definition for the extracorporeal blood purification system and acquire necessary
equipment.   

2.2.1.2  Fabricate breadboard prototypes for anticoagulation-free anti-sepsis extracorporeal system (ASEPSYS)
device. Fabricate prototype blood tubing sets. Acquire anti-thrombogenic surface-modified hollow fiber plasma separators.   

2.2.1.3  Assemble and test breadboard ASEPSYS devices  ex vivo  with bovine blood. The test will most
likely be conducted using a porcine model where the elapsed time to reach a pre-defined degree of clotting in the blood treatment
device will be compared between the new device and two control groups; one using standard anticoagulant therapy and one using none.
Determine contribution of the following techniques and approaches to eliminating anticoagulants: 
 
(1)      
 Backflushing at regular intervals, (2) Turbo loop, (3) Continuous pre-dilution loop using re-captured hydration fluid, (4)
Linear vs pulsatile blood flow, (5) Elimination of air/blood interfaces in extracorporeal circuit, (6) Anti-thrombogenic derivatized
plasma separation membrane, and (7) Ultra-short half-life anticoagulant nafamostat mesilate.
