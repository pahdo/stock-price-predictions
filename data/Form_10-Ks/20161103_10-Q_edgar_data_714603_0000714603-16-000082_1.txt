1.    Summary of Accounting Policies    
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of DST Systems, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries ( we,   our,   us,  the  Company  or  DST ) included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to enable a reasonable understanding of the information presented.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Certain amounts in the   2015   financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   presentation.  On July 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our North American Customer Communications business.  Additionally, during the second quarter 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan for management to pursue the divestiture of our United Kingdom Customer Communications business.  As a result, beginning in the second quarter 2016, the Customer Communications segment, as well as certain businesses previously reported within the Financial Services segment that were part of the July 1, 2016 sale, have been reported as discontinued operations.  Prior period amounts have been adjusted to be consistent with the current discontinued operations presentation.  See   Note 3  , Discontinued Operations, for additional information.   
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly state the consolidated financial position and the results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the periods presented.  The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year 2016. 
    
  New authoritative accounting guidance 
    
  In October 2016, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance which requires the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements; however, we do expect increased volatility in earnings as the excess tax benefits driven by changes in our stock price will be recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Income upon adoption. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued its final lease accounting standard which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations.  The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The standard is to be applied under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.  We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which updates the reporting model for certain financial instruments, including the requirement for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires a cumulative-effective adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  Effects on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts should be recorded in the same period s financial statements and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.  It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities.  In connection with the adoption of the guidance on January 1, 2016, the Company reevaluated all of its investment products for consolidation and determined that certain of its investments in private equity funds met the definition of a VIE as our equity interests lacked the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  The revised consolidation guidance did not result in consolidation of any of our investments.  See Note 4, Investments, for additional details regarding our investments in variable interest entities.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard and subsequently issued amendments will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter 2018 and may be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  Early adoption of this standard is permitted as of January 2017.  We are currently evaluating the standard, including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

2.    Significant Business Acquisitions    
    
  Acquisition of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC 
    
  On February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS ) for   $94.7 million   in cash, after giving effect to a   $0.3 million   adjustment agreed upon in June 2016 to settle working capital under the provisions of the purchase agreement.  DST financed the acquisition through cash-on-hand and available lines of credit.  KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community.  KRFS  hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services and customized reporting.  We expect the acquisition to provide us with additional opportunities within the alternative investment marketplace and to expand our asset administration service offerings.  KRFS is included within the Financial Services segment.  
    
  The factors described above, combined with the synergies expected from combining our operations with the acquired entity and the resulting expansion of the service offerings available to our clients, are the basis for the acquisition price paid resulting in   $61.0 million   of goodwill recorded, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
  The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and as such, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration transferred were recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

  The following table summarizes the intangible assets acquired and estimated weighted-average useful lives as of the acquisition date (in millions): 

The operating results of KRFS were combined with our operating results subsequent to the acquisition date.  Approximately   $6.1 million   and   $14.8 million   of revenues and   $0.2 million   net pretax loss and   $0.5 million   net pretax income of the acquired business is included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Pro-forma results of operations, assuming the acquisition was made at the beginning of the earliest period presented, have not been presented because the effect of this acquisition is not material to our results.       

3.     Discontinued Operations    
    
  On July 1, 2016, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated June 14, 2016, we completed the sale of our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of   $410.0 million  , subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments.  We recorded an estimated pretax gain of   $340.1 million   on the sale during the third quarter 2016, which has been presented as a component of discontinued operations.  Additionally, during the second quarter 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan for management to pursue the divestiture of our United Kingdom Customer Communications business, which we anticipate will be completed within the required one year period.  As a result of this significant shift in the strategic direction of our operations, we have classified the results of the businesses sold or being sold as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Statement of Cash Flows for all periods presented.  Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations are classified as held for sale in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, the Company will continue to provide certain information technology and operations processing activities to the North American Customer Communications business for an estimated period of 12 to 18 months from the transaction date.  Additionally, we will continue to incur costs for certain print-related services received from the disposed business for an estimated period of 3 to 5 years from the transaction date.  The revenues previously eliminated in consolidation that have continued post-transaction were approximately   $5.7 million   and   $13.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $3.1 million   and   $10.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The expenses previously eliminated in consolidation that have continued post-transaction were approximately   $12.9 million   and   $21.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $4.9 million   and   $13.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The revenues and expenses associated with these continued activities have been classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.  The offsetting costs and revenues previously recorded within Customer Communications and eliminated in consolidation have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

The following table summarizes the comparative financial results of discontinued operations which are presented as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (in millions): 

In April 2016, we completed the sale of our United Kingdom Customer Communications  Bristol production facilities for pretax proceeds totaling approximately   $16.0 million  .  Concurrent with this sale, we leased back approximately two-thirds of the facilities under a   12  -year lease.  The rent payments and associated rent expense of the Bristol production facilities are approximately   $0.7 million   per year over the   12  -year lease term. 

4.    Investments    
    
  Investments are as follows (in millions):

  (unaudited)  

Certain information related to our available-for-sale securities is as follows (in millions): 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of our available-for-sale investments was   $163.7 million   and   $219.5 million  , respectively.  Deferred tax liabilities associated with the available-for-sale investments were approximately   $54.7 million   and   $54.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received   $61.2 million   and   $249.3 million  , respectively, from the sale of investments in available-for-sale securities.   Gross realized gains of   $0.2 million   and   $2.5 million   and gross realized losses of   $0.1 million   and   $1.5 million   were recorded during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, from the sale of available-for-sale securities.  Gross realized gains of   $6.0 million   and   $165.8 million   and gross realized losses of   $3.8 million   and   $3.9 million   were recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, from the sale of available-for-sale securities. 
    
  We consolidate the investments of open-end funds in which we own a controlling interest as a result of our seed capital investments.  The seed capital investments of   $66.2 million   and   $50.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are comprised primarily of equity securities as well as   $12.7 million   and   $10.8 million   of cash collateral deposited with a broker for securities sold short at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  We are a limited partner in various private equity funds which are primarily accounted for using the cost method.  Our involvement in financing the operations of the private equity fund investments is generally limited to our investments in the entities.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our carrying value of these private equity fund investments was approximately   $112.2 million   and   $117.2 million  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had future capital commitments related to these private equity fund investments of approximately   $4.0 million  .  Additionally, we have other investments with a carrying value of   $16.7 million   and   $16.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  We record lower of cost or market valuation adjustments on cost method and other investments when impairment conditions, such as adverse market conditions or poor performance of the underlying investment, are present.  We had   no   impairments on cost method and other investments during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  As a result of the revised consolidation guidance, we determined that our investments in private equity funds meet the definition of a VIE; however, the private equity fund investments were not consolidated as we do not have the power to direct the entities  most significant economic activities.  The maximum risk of loss related to our private equity fund investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments in the entities plus any future capital commitments.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our maximum risk of loss associated with these VIE s, which is comprised of our investment and required future capital commitments, was   $116.2 million   and   $120.9 million  , respectively.  

5.    Unconsolidated Affiliates    
    
  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are as follows (in millions):

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates are as follows (in millions): 

On March 29, 2016, we and our joint venture partner, State Street, each provided a subordinated loan of approximately   $15.0 million   to IFDS U.K. in which the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest is payable in full at maturity in March 2021.  Additionally, we and State Street each provided an additional subordinated loan of approximately   $13.0 million   to IFDS U.K. on September 30, 2016.  The principal plus accrued and unpaid interest is payable in full at maturity in September 2021.   

6.    Fair Value Measurements    
    
  Authoritative accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held certain investment assets and certain liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  These investments include our money market funds, available-for-sale equity securities, trading securities, seed capital investments and securities sold short whereby fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets.  Accordingly, the fair value measurements of these investments have been classified as Level 1 in the tables below.  Fair value for deferred compensation liabilities that are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying hypothetical investments, primarily equity securities, have been classified as Level 1 in the tables below.  In addition, we have interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value.  Fair value for the derivative instruments was determined using inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable.  Accordingly, our derivative instruments have been classified as Level 2 in the tables below.   
    
  The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held approximately   $12.0 million   and   $6.1 million  , respectively, of investments in pooled funds, which are measured using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value and therefore excluded from the table above.  The investments in pooled funds are included within the   $128.9 million   and   $133.2 million   of cost method and other investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, disclosed within   Note 4  ,   Investments  .

Amortization expense of intangible assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was approximately   $4.3 million   and   $12.3 million   as compared to   $3.3 million   and   $8.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The following table summarizes the estimated annual amortization for intangible assets recorded as of   September 30, 2016   (in millions):     

Goodwill 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , by segment (in millions): 

8.    Debt    
    
  We are obligated under notes and other indebtedness as follows (in millions): 

Accounts receivable securitization program 
    
  We securitize certain of our domestic accounts receivable through an accounts receivable securitization program with a third-party bank.  The maximum amount that can be outstanding under this program is   $150.0 million  .  The facility will expire by its terms in May 2018, unless renewed.  As a result of the business sale, the North American Customer Communications business was removed from the accounts receivable securitization program resulting in a reduction in the receivables eligible to be borrowed against beginning in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  The outstanding amount under the program was   $88.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  There was   no   outstanding amount under the program at   December 31, 2015  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , total proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program were approximately   $746.8 million   and   $812.0 million  , respectively, and total repayments were approximately   $658.2 million   and   $782.0 million  , respectively, which comprise the net cash flows presented within the financing section of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Revolving credit facilities 
    
  Our syndicated credit facility provides for revolving unsecured credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $850.0 million  .  The outstanding amount under this syndicated credit facility was   $10.0 million   and   $226.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  We also have various other unsecured revolving lines of credit to support our consolidated subsidiaries  operations that provide total borrowings of up to   $30.0 million  .  There were   no   borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , total proceeds from our revolving credit facilities were approximately   $768.7 million   and   $851.1 million  , respectively, and total repayments were approximately   $984.8 million   and   $617.8 million  , respectively, which comprise the net cash flows presented within the financing section of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
    
  Fair value 
    
  Based upon the borrowing rates currently available to us for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying value of long-term debt, with the exception of the privately placed senior notes, (collectively, the  Senior Notes ), is considered to approximate fair value.  The estimated fair values of the Senior Notes were derived principally from quoted prices for similar financial instruments (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying values and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes were as follows (in millions): 

9.    Income Taxes    
    
  We record income tax expense during interim periods based on our best estimate of the full year s tax rate as adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant interim period.  Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and any change in the estimated rate is recorded on a cumulative basis.  Our tax rate on income from continuing operations was   38.3%   and   37.3%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   19.4%   and   33.3%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The Company s tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily attributable to state income taxes and transaction related taxes, partially offset by dividends received deductions and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income.  The Company s tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to benefits realized from the release of certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions that were settled, effectively settled, or otherwise remeasured during the period. 
     
  Our estimated annual effective full year   2016   tax rate will vary from the statutory federal rate primarily as a result of variances among the estimates and actual amounts of full year sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits (e.g., research and experimentation, foreign tax and state incentive), adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review and our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions.

10.    Equity    
    
  Earnings per share 
    
  The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):  

We had approximately   32.7 million   and   34.9 million   common shares outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.    No   shares from options to purchase common stock were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Share based compensation 
    
  We have share based compensation plans covering our employees and non-employee directors.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we granted approximately   0.4 million   restricted stock units ( RSU s ), of which approximately   0.3 million   are performance stock units.  Additionally, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had   0.4 million   RSU s vest as the result of the completion of the service requirements or achievement of the service and performance features of the awards, as applicable.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   0.9 million   unvested RSU s and   0.3 million   stock options outstanding.  
    
  We recognized share based compensation expense of   $1.4 million   and   $16.7 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $7.3 million   and   $21.7 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  These amounts are inclusive of discontinued operations.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $65.2 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to our share based compensation arrangements, net of estimated forfeitures.  We estimate that compensation expense recognition attributable to currently outstanding stock option and RSU grants will be approximately   $5.0 million   for the   remainder of 2016  ,   $12.7 million   for   2017  ,   $7.0 million   for   2018   and   $1.4 million   for   2019  .  Future expense recognition is not projected on approximately   $39.1 million   of unrecognized compensation expense as the related awards are not currently expected to achieve their required performance features and therefore not expected to vest.

One   of our unconsolidated affiliates had an interest rate swap liability with a fair market value of   $44.0 million   and   $44.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The unconsolidated affiliate used inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable relating to the measurement of the interest rate swap.  Our   50%   proportionate share of this interest rate swap liability was   $22.0 million   and   $22.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  We record our proportionate share of this liability in an amount not to exceed the carrying value of our investment in this unconsolidated affiliate.  Because the carrying value of this unconsolidated affiliate investment balance was zero at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , no change in the interest rate swap liability was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  Stock repurchases 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we repurchased approximately   2.0 million   shares of DST common stock for   $225.0 million  .  On June 13, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new   $300.0 million   share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market transactions and private transactions.  The plan does not have an expiration date.    During October 2016, we spent     $75.0 million   to repurchase approximately   0.7 million   shares.      As of October 31, 2016, there was approximately     $150.0 million   remaining under our new share repurchase plan.    
    
  Shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the option exercise price and for tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase the Company s stock or from the vesting of restricted stock are included in common stock repurchased in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The amount of such share receipts and withholdings for option exercises and restricted stock vesting was   $15.7 million   and   $5.2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  Total dividends for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $33.8 million   and   $33.9 million  , respectively.  Cash dividends paid during both the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $32.8 million  .  The remaining amount of dividends represents dividend equivalent shares of restricted stock units in lieu of cash dividends. 
    
  On October 28, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.33   per share on our common stock, payable on December 15, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 23, 2016.   

11.    Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Agreements    
    
  We have letters of credit and bank guarantees of   $10.7 million   and   $10.6 million   outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Letters of credit are secured by our debt facilities.   
    
  We have entered into agreements with certain officers whereby upon defined circumstances constituting a change in control of the Company, certain benefit entitlements are automatically funded and such officers are entitled to specific cash payments upon termination of employment.  Additionally, we have adopted the DST Systems, Inc. Executive Severance Plan, which provides certain benefits to participants in the event of a qualifying termination under the plan.     
    
  In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.  We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, data and confidentiality obligations, intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.  These agreements may limit the time period in which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Legal Proceedings  
    
  We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our businesses.  While the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, that the final outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  

12.    Segment Information    
    
  Our operating business units offer sophisticated information processing and software services and products.  We present these businesses as   two   operating segments, Financial Services and Healthcare Services.  During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our North American Customer Communications business and announced our intent to sell our United Kingdom Customer Communications business.  As a result, beginning in the second quarter 2016, the Customer Communications segment, as well as certain businesses previously reported within the Financial Services segment that were part of the July 1, 2016 sale, have been reported as discontinued operations.  Prior periods have also been adjusted to be consistent with the current presentation.  Investments in our equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests are included in the Investments and Other segment.  
    
  Information concerning total assets by reporting segment is as follows (in millions):  

We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on income before interest expense, income taxes and non-controlling interest.  Intersegment revenues are reflected at rates determined by us and may not be reflective of market rates.  Summarized financial information concerning our segments is shown in the following tables (in millions):

13.    Restructuring Charges    
    
  As a result of market changes that have impacted DST s service offerings to clients, including lower registered account processing, DST completed a restructuring in June 2016 to reduce our workforce and consolidate certain facilities to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services segment.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred pretax restructuring charges related to employee termination costs of   $9.9 million   and lease termination costs of   $0.5 million   related to this restructuring event.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a liability of   $0.6 million   associated with these restructuring activities.  

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  
  This report contains  forward-looking statements  - that is, statements related to future, not past, events.  In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as  expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   believe,   seek,   see,   will,   would,  or  target.  Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.  
  For us, particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include:

    changes in law, economic and financial conditions;  
                
    the impacts of breaches or potential breaches of network, information technology or data security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; 
                
    our investments in joint ventures or other unconsolidated affiliates; for example, some of our joint venture investments are subject to contractual obligations which could restrict us from selling such interests; 
                
    the effectiveness of our risk management framework;  
                
    the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation and litigation and SEC or DOL regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds;

    the other factors that are described in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  within this Form 10-Q and within  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
       
  These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements.  We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.  This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts.  Actual results could differ materially. 
  Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact     our financial statements or results of operations     are difficult to predict.  These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.  
   
  INTRODUCTION 
    
  DST Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries ( we,   our,   us,  the  Company  or  DST ) use proprietary software applications to provide specialized technology, strategic advisory, and business operations outsourcing primarily to the financial and healthcare industries.  Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure support necessary to support our solution offerings.  In order to position the company to take advantage of new and emerging technologies, we are embarking on an IT transformation effort which will increase our operating expenses for the next three to four years.  We expect the result of these investments to be lower centralized infrastructure costs and a more agile platform on which to deliver future capabilities.  
  We manage our business through two operating segments, Financial Services and Healthcare Services.  Our investments in equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests have been aggregated into an Investments and Other segment.  
  In connection with the execution of our strategic plan, which focuses on the Financial Services and Healthcare Services markets, we sold our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of   $410.0 million  , subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, on July 1, 2016.  We recorded an estimated pretax gain of   $340.1 million   on the sale during the third quarter 2016, which has been presented as a component of discontinued operations.  Additionally, during the second quarter 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan for management to divest of our United Kingdom Customer Communications business.  As a result of this significant shift in the strategic direction of our operations, we have classified the results of the businesses sold or being sold as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for all periods presented.  
  Financial Services Segment 
  Through the Financial Services segment, we provide investor, investment, advisor/intermediary and asset distribution services to companies within the Financial Services industry.  DST s proprietary software applications enable us to offer our customers information processing solutions that enable them to capture, analyze and report their investors  transactions.  Examples of the services we provide include tracking of purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining investor identification and ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; processing dividends; reporting sales; performing tax and other compliance functions; and providing information for printing of investor trade confirmations, statements and year-end tax forms.  
  Services are provided either under a remote processing ( Remote ) model or on a business process outsourcing ( BPO ) basis.  Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by our proprietary workflow software, AWD , which is also licensed separately to third parties. 
  In the U.S., we provide services to mutual funds, brokerage firms, retirement plans and alternative investment funds (such as real estate investment trusts) either directly or through Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ( BFDS ), our domestic joint venture with State Street Corporation ( State Street ).  In Australia and the U.K., we license software solutions to funds and fund managers, who perform participant accounting and recordkeeping for the wealth management and retirement savings market.  We also provide investor services on a Remote and BPO basis internationally (U.K., Canada, Ireland and Luxembourg) solely through IFDS U.K. and IFDS L.P., which are also joint ventures with State Street. 
  Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed.  For subaccounts, a portion of the services we provide for registered accounts are provided directly by the broker/dealer.  As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts.  On a more limited  

24 

     Table of Contents  

basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts.  We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.  We receive revenues for processing services and products provided under various agreements with unconsolidated affiliates.  We believe that the terms of our contracts with unconsolidated affiliates are fair to us and are no less favorable to us than those obtained from unaffiliated parties. 
    
  We continue to evaluate the products and services we offer within the Financial Services segment and have identified certain current offerings in which the increased risk and required investment resulting from recent regulations outweighs the benefit we expect to receive.  As a result of this evaluation, during third quarter 2016 we made the decision to exit certain non-core products and services. We expect the exiting of these businesses will result in approximately $8.6 million less operating revenue and $3.8 million less operating income on an annual basis.  Additionally, in November 2016, we sold a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that provides water billing software and services solutions for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million, subject to customary working capital post-closing adjustments. This business had approximately $5.4 million of operating revenue and $1.2 million of operating income on an annual basis.  As these decisions were the result of a tactical review of our products and services, and not the result of a significant shift in strategic direction, the revenue and operating income from these products and services are included within our continuing operations.   
    
  On February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS ) for   $94.7 million   in cash, after giving effect to a   $0.3 million   adjustment agreed upon in June 2016 to settle working capital under the provisions of the purchase agreement.  KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community.  KRFS  hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.  We expect the acquisition to provide us with additional opportunities within the alternative investment marketplace and expand our asset administration service offerings. 
  Healthcare Services Segment 
  The Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of pharmacy, healthcare administration, and health outcomes optimization solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies.  Our healthcare solutions include claims administration, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services.  We also continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services  offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve.  For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our customers and prospective customers achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM ) market.  Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis.  As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new customer contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions.  If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements. 
  We generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis.  Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting.  Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts.  Healthcare administration and health outcomes optimization revenues are generally derived from fees charged based on a per member/per month basis and transactional basis.  We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase.  Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, two of our Healthcare Services customers notified us that they would be transitioning their services off our systems effective in the first quarter of 2017.  We continue to expect our Healthcare Segment to achieve strong revenue growth through a combination of new client wins and organic growth.  However, we now expect this growth will derive from a smaller revenue base, which will result in lower overall segment revenue growth during 2017 as compared to 2016.

Investments and Other Segment 
  The Investments and Other segment is comprised of our real estate subsidiaries and joint ventures, investments in equity securities, private equity investments and other financial interests.  The assets held by this segment are primarily passive in nature.  
  The Investments and Other segment s revenues are derived from rental income from third-party real estate leases.  Rental income is recorded as revenue when, based on lease terms, it is earned.  The Investments and Other segment records investment income (dividends, interest and net gains or losses on investment securities) within Other income, net.  The Investments and Other segment derives part of its income from its pro rata share in the earnings or losses of certain unconsolidated affiliates.  We make lease payments to certain real estate joint ventures.  
  Seasonality 
  Generally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations.  Processing volumes for mutual fund customers within our Financial Services segment are usually highest during the three months ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions during January.  Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contract.

  Consolidated total revenues (including out-of-pocket ( OOP ) reimbursements) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $386.7 million   and   $1,157.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $15.1 million   or   4.1%   and   $67.1 million   or   6.2%   compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Consolidated operating revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $12.1 million   or   3.4%   and   $58.0 million   or   5.6%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .   
    
  The   increase   in consolidated operating revenues during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was attributable to increased operating revenues across both the Financial Services and Healthcare Services operating segments.  
    
  Consolidated OOP reimbursements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $3.0 million   or   16.5%   and   $9.1 million   or   18.9%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   increase   in OOP reimbursements is primarily attributable to increased client volumes in the Financial Services segment.   
    
  Operating income 
    
  Consolidated operating income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $74.3 million   and   $171.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $12.7 million   or   20.6%   and   $1.4 million   or   0.8%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   increase   in operating income during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to increases within both the Financial Services segment and the Healthcare Services segment.  The   increase   in operating income during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to increases within the Healthcare Services segment, partially offset by decreases within the Financial Services segment.

Interest expense 
    
  Interest expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $5.4 million   and   $18.0 million  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $0.4 million   and   an increase   of   $0.3 million   as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The decrease in interest expense during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings.  The increase in interest expense during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings. 
    
  Other income, net 
    
  The components of other income, net are as follows (in millions):  

We recorded   no   gains from the sale of State Street available-for-sale securities as we did not sell any State Street securities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to a gain of   $157.3 million   from the sale of approximately   2.3 million   shares of State Street during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is as follows (in millions):  

Additional condensed financial information of our significant operating unconsolidated affiliates, BFDS and IFDS, is presented below (in millions): 

DST s equity in earnings of IFDS   decreased     $4.3 million   and   $13.5 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   decrease   is primarily the result of lower revenues recognized related to the ongoing client conversion activities and higher operating costs as IFDS expands its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory, compliance and security needs.

The multi-year implementation efforts for the two IFDS wealth management platform clients are progressing, however the scope and timing continues to be adjusted as client requirements evolve.  In 2014, IFDS began capitalizing a significant portion of the software development costs incurred to develop the new wealth management platform for the U.K. market resulting in approximately    130.6 million   (   65.3 million   at DST s 50% ownership) of capitalized costs through   September 30, 2016  .  These costs will continue to be incurred as the platform is completed.  As the projects are completed and the underlying modules are placed into production, we expect that IFDS  earnings will decrease due to the amortization of the capitalized software costs coupled with the decline in implementation revenue. 
    
  DST s equity in earnings of BFDS   decreased     $0.2 million   and   increased     $1.6 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The increase in equity in earnings of BFDS during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was due to higher ancillary revenues and reduced operating costs. 
    
  Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates   decreased     $0.3 million   and   $3.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   decrease   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower gains from the sale of real estate investments in 2015.  
    
  Income taxes 
    
  We record income tax expense for interim periods based on our best estimate of the annual tax rate as adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period.  Our tax rate was   38.3%   and   37.3%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   19.4%   and   33.3%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The change in the Company s tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily a result of benefits realized for the release of certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions settled, effectively settled or otherwise remeasured during 2015 that did not recur in 2016 as well as a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income. 
    
  Excluding the effect of discrete period items, we expect our annual tax rate to be approximately   36.0%   for full year   2016  .  The full year   2016   tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of full year sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits (e.g., research and experimentation, foreign tax and state incentive), adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review and our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions.  
    
  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 
  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $222.8 million   and   $260.0 million  , respectively, an increase of   $213.8 million   and   $224.3 million   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The increase is primarily attributable to an estimated $233.6 million gain, net of tax, from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business.

Operating revenues 
    
  Financial Services segment operating revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $270.2 million   and   $817.5 million  , respectively,   an increase   of   $2.5 million   or   0.9%   and   $26.3 million   or   3.3%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   increase   in operating revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is primarily driven from the businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016, which contributed   $9.0 million   and   $27.8 million   of incremental operating revenues during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business.  In September 2016, we also completed the conversion of approximately 10.0 million subaccounts associated with the previously announced client contracts, which resulted in incremental revenue.  These increases were partly offset by a decline in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenue due to lower registered accounts, primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions, and approximately   $0.6 million   and   $4.6 million   of negative foreign currency movements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Lower revenue due to extending certain long-term contracts at lower pricing also partially offset the increase in operating revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   in comparison to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Software license revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $6.9 million   and   $22.8 million  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $1.1 million   and   $2.0 million   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  
    
  Costs and expenses 
     
  Financial Services segment costs and expenses were   $213.7 million   and   $688.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $3.9 million   or   1.8%   and   an increase     $40.8 million   or   6.3%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  Costs and expenses in the Financial Services segment are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits costs as well as technology-related expenditures and reimbursable operating expenses.  Reimbursable operating costs, included in costs and expenses, were   $19.4 million   and   $51.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   an increase   of   $3.5 million   or   22.0%   and   $8.1 million   or   18.9%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  
    
  Excluding reimbursable operating costs, costs and expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $194.3 million   and   $637.4 million  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $7.4 million   or   3.7%   and   an increase   of   $32.7 million   or   5.4%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   decrease   in costs and expenses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily impacted by the reversal of approximately   $6.5 million   of accrued performance-related contingent consideration, as well as increased cost savings resulting from previously implemented restructuring and other cost containment initiatives

and   $0.8 million   of foreign currency movements.  Partly offsetting the decrease in costs and expenses were the acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which resulted in incremental operating expenses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .    
    
  The   increase   in costs and expenses during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily associated with the  acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which resulted in approximately $28.5 million of incremental operating expenses.  Also contributing to the increase in costs and expenses were the restructuring activities, which resulted in $10.4 million of employee and lease termination costs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services segment, increased costs incurred to enhance the network infrastructure utilized across all of our operating businesses and incremental costs to service new and existing clients.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we also recognized a $6.0 million software impairment.  These increases were partly offset by continued cost containment efforts and   $6.0 million   of foreign currency movements during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Depreciation and amortization 
    
  Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $19.0 million   and   $56.4 million  , respectively,   an increase   of   $1.1 million   or   6.1%   and   $5.0 million   or   9.7%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   increase   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure and increase security and regulatory compliance. 
    
  Operating income 
    
  Financial Services segment operating income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $56.9 million   and   $123.7 million  , respectively,   an increase   of   $8.8 million   or   18.3%   and   a decrease   of   $11.4 million   or   8.4%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  Financial Services segment operating income   increased   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the reversal of accrued performance-related contingent consideration, higher revenues and cost savings resulting from the previously implemented restructuring and other cost containment initiatives.   
    
  Financial Services segment operating income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   due to restructuring costs incurred during 2016 and increased costs to enhance our network infrastructure, maintain security and regulatory compliance.  Additionally, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized a $6.0 million software impairment.  These decreases were partly offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related contingent consideration, higher operating revenues and cost containment efforts during 2016.  The impacts on operating income from foreign currency movements were not significant.

The following tables summarize the Healthcare Services segment s statistical results (in millions): 

Operating revenues 
    
  Healthcare Services segment operating revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $106.1 million   and   $314.3 million  , respectively,   an increase   of   $12.1 million   or   12.9%   and   $36.3 million   or   13.1%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  Operating revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were higher as compared to the same   periods   in   2015   primarily from new medical claims processing clients implemented in January 2016, organic growth and expansion of the high-value services we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses.  Operating revenues include approximately   $1.7 million   and   $5.5 million   of software license fee revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   an increase   of   $0.4 million   and   a decrease   of   $1.8 million   over the same   periods   in   2015  .   
    
  Costs and expenses  
    
  Healthcare Services segment costs and expenses were   $86.0 million   and   $258.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   an increase   of   $7.6 million   or   9.7%   and   $20.5 million   or   8.6%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  Healthcare Services costs and expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits costs but also include technology-related expenditures.   
    
  The   increase   in costs and expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to a combination of increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to growth in business process outsourcing services and higher restructuring costs as we consolidate our operations.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization 
    
  Healthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $3.8 million   and   $12.0 million  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $1.0 million   or   20.8%   and   $2.0 million   or   14.3%   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  , attributable to lower capital expenditures.

Operating income 
    
  Healthcare Services segment operating income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $18.1 million   and   $50.5 million  , respectively,   an increase   of   $4.9 million   and   $18.2 million   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   increase   is primarily attributable to higher revenues from new medical claims processing clients implemented in January 2016 and enhanced economies of scale, partially offset by increased staffing costs associated with supporting new and existing client growth and higher restructuring costs as we consolidate our operations.  

INVESTMENTS AND OTHER SEGMENT 
    
  The Investments and Other segment recorded an operating loss of   $0.7 million   and   $2.3 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $1.0 million   and   $5.4 million   as compared to the same   periods   in   2015  .  The   decrease   in operating income is primarily related to a $3.1 million gain on the sale of real estate during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   that did not recur in 2016 as well as incremental expense associated with the charitable contributions of marketable securities to a donor-advised fund during 2016.  These were partially offset by lower occupancy costs for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Company s assessment of short-term and long-term liquidity 
    
  We believe that our existing cash balances and other current assets, together with cash provided by operating activities and, as necessary, our revolving credit facilities, will meet our operating and debt service requirements and other current liabilities for at least the next 12 months.  Further, we believe that our short-term liquidity may be increased by monetizing available-for-sale securities owned by our domestic subsidiaries (which were   $163.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  ) and other assets, and that our longer term liquidity and capital requirements will be met through cash provided by operating activities and bank credit facilities.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $860.1 million   of availability under our domestic revolving credit facilities.  
    
  Sources and uses of cash 
    
  We had   $180.9 million   and   $79.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash provided by operations.  In addition, we have used proceeds from the sale of investments to fund other investing and financing activities.  Principal uses of cash are operations, reinvestment in our proprietary technologies, capital expenditures, investment purchases, business acquisitions, payments on debt, stock repurchases and dividend payments.  Information on our consolidated cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, categorized by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 
    
  The sale of our North American Customer Communications business on July 1, 2016 resulted in cash consideration of $410.0 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to make a tax payment of approximately $75.0 million associated with the gain on the sale.  We expect to use the after-tax proceeds from the sale to continue to advance our strategic priorities, including ongoing investments in our remaining businesses, acquisitions and shareholder returns.   
    
  Operating activities  
    
  Cash flows provided from operating activities from continuing operations were   $147.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to cash flows from operating activities of   $67.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $79.9 million  .   
    
  Operating cash flows from continuing operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted principally from net income of   $124.0 million  , adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items including equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of   $23.9 million   and depreciation and amortization expense of   $69.1 million  , and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $30.0 million  .  Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities during the period include a   $32.4 million   decrease in accrued compensation and benefits primarily due to the annual payments for incentive compensation and other employee benefits.

     Table of Contents  

Operating cash flows from continuing operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulted principally from net income of   $254.7 million  , adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items including net gains on investments of   $161.1 million  , equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of   $39.2 million  , and depreciation and amortization expense of   $66.0 million  , as well as a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $65.1 million  .  Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities during the period include a   $25.8 million   use of cash for accrued compensation and benefits primarily due to the annual payments for incentive compensation and other employee benefits and a   $34.9 million   decrease in income taxes payable primarily driven by the timing of tax payments on investment sales.  
    
  Investing activities 
    
  Cash flows provided from investing activities from continuing operations were   $82.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $186.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $103.9 million  .   
    
  Investing cash flows from continuing operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted principally from   $167.9 million   of net changes in funds held to satisfy client funds obligations and   $257.5 million   of proceeds from sales/maturities of investments.  These sources of cash were partially offset by cash used to acquire Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC, purchase capital assets, and invest in securities (principally seed capital investments) of   $93.5 million  ,   $42.7 million  , and   $198.3 million  , respectively, as well as approximately $28.0 million of cash loaned to IFDS U.K. during 2016. 
  Investing cash flows from continuing operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulted principally from   $264.5 million   of proceeds from sales/maturities of investments and   $157.2 million   of net changes in funds held to satisfy client fund obligations.  These sources of cash were partially offset by cash used to purchase capital assets, invest in securities, and acquire businesses of   $74.3 million  ,   $67.4 million  , and   $117.4 million  , respectively. 
  Capital expenditures 
    
  The following table summarizes capital expenditures by segment (in millions): 

Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities or borrowings from our bank credit facilities.  
    
  Financing activities 
    
  Cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations were   $558.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $291.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Financing cash flows used for continuing operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted principally from net changes in client funds obligations of   $167.9 million  ,   $240.7 million   of share repurchases and   $127.5 million   of decreased borrowings on our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facilities during 2016.   
  Financing cash flows used for continuing operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulted principally from   $330.2 million   of share repurchases, net changes in client fund obligations of   $157.2 million   and   $263.3 million   of net repayments of our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facilities during 2015.

Common stock repurchases 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we repurchased approximately   2.0 million   shares of DST common stock for   $225.0 million  , which completed the existing share repurchase plan.  On June 13, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan.     During October 2016, we spent     $75.0 million   to repurchase approximately   0.7 million   shares.      As of October 31, 2016, there was approximately     $150.0 million   remaining under our new share repurchase plan.    During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of DST common stock for $325.0 million under previous share repurchase programs from 2014 and 2015. 
    
  Shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the option exercise price and for tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase the Company s stock or from the vesting of restricted stock are included in common stock repurchased in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The amount of such share receipts and withholdings for option exercises and restricted stock vesting was   $15.7 million   and   $5.2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.  In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency and other client balances invested overnight.  We had   $373.0 million   and   $533.4 million   of client funds obligations at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Debt activity 
    
  We have used the following primary sources of financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; subsidiary line of credit facilities; accounts receivable securitization program; privately placed senior notes; and secured borrowings.  We had   $428.7 million   and   $562.1 million   of debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,   a decrease   of   $133.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily resulting from the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business to pay down outstanding balances, partially offset by borrowings to fund the KRFS business acquisition, share repurchases and working capital uses.  
    
  Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and restricted payments (including stock repurchases and cash dividends), and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants.  An event of default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated.  Our debt arrangements are described in   Note 8   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Guarantees  
    
  In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.  We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, data and confidentiality obligations, intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.  These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Off balance sheet obligations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  The operations of our businesses and our financial results can be affected by changes in equity pricing, interest rates and currency exchange rates.   

36 

     Table of Contents  

Available-for-sale equity price risk 
    
  Our investments in available-for-sale equity securities are subject to price risk.  The fair value of our available-for-sale investments as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $163.7 million  .  The impact on comprehensive income of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would be approximately   $10.1 million  .  Net unrealized gains and losses on our investments in available-for-sale securities have had a material effect on our comprehensive income and financial position. 
    
  Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future.  Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
    
  Interest rate risk 
    
  We and certain of our joint ventures derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for our clients.  The balances maintained in the bank accounts are subject to fluctuation.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , DST and BFDS had average daily cash balances of approximately   $1.8 billion   maintained in such accounts, of which approximately   $1.1 billion   were maintained at BFDS.  We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the interest earnings rate would equal approximately   $6.5 million   of net income (loss) on an annual basis.  The effect of changes in interest rates attributable to earnings derived from cash balances we hold for clients is partially offset by changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $428.7 million   of debt, of which   $98.6 million   was subject to variable interest rates (Federal Funds rates, LIBOR rates, Prime rates).  Included in this amount are program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program, which are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.  We estimate that a 10% increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or to the fair value of our debt.   
    
  Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
    
  The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.  The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.  Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.  We translate our assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, and translate income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically materially affected our consolidated financial results.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our international subsidiaries had approximately   $219.1 million   in total assets, and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , these international subsidiaries recorded net income of approximately   $5.5 million   and   $17.7 million  , respectively.  We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would change total consolidated assets by approximately   $21.9 million  .  Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates would change consolidated reported net income by approximately   $1.8 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We have entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally British pound and Thai baht) on our operations.  The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives is   $115.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net asset of   $0.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would result in a   $0.2 million   change in other comprehensive income.  The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net liability of   $0.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  We estimate a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a   $6.7 million   change to consolidated net income.  Substantially all gains and losses on the derivative instruments are offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no net material impact on earnings.      

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files under the Exchange Act is

     Table of Contents  

accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report conducted by the Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Internal control over financial reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15 and 15(d)-15 under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The information required by this item is included in   Note 11  ,  Commitments and Contingencies, -   Legal Proceedings    of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report and is incorporated herein by reference.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  The only material changes to our risk factors as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 
    
  The SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds, which could adversely affect our business.  The Department of Labor recently issued fiduciary regulations that are likely to impact our business. 
  The SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds and other fund- types products (collectively referred to as  mutual funds ), which could adversely affect our business.  The SEC may issue additional regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale.  Additionally, brokers and financial intermediaries will become, in some instances, subject to a new DOL-imposed fiduciary standard-of-care that, if applicable, could cause them to alter their methods of distribution and/or wholesaling activities.  The new DOL fiduciary regulations were recently issued and it is not yet clear what impact they may have on such activities.  We cannot predict the requirements the SEC or FINRA may propose and finally adopt in this area.  Regulations that would cause current distribution channels or interest in mutual fund investing to change could decrease the number of accounts on our systems as a result of changes in client offerings or the attractiveness of offerings to customers of our clients.  The biggest impact of the fiduciary regulations will fall on brokers and registered investment advisers ( RIAs ) who give individualized non-discretionary advice in the  retail  marketplace, discretionary investment managers in the  institutional  space will also be affected, primarily in connection with sales of investment products and services.  To the extent that our business units, clients, unaffiliated intermediary partners and retirement plan service providers fit into these categories, this could adversely affect our business and operating results.  Additionally, to the extent the Dodd- Frank Act and/or DOL regulations impact the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us. 
  We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. 
    
  Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.  We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.  We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.  Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.  Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management s attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.  The anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize.  Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the issuance of capital stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.  If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected. 

38 

     Table of Contents  

In addition, we have divested, and may in the future divest, businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan.  These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in continued responsibility for the divested business, including through indemnification, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results. 
    
  We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems could result in significant costs and reputational damage.  
    
  We have developed and maintained, and our businesses depend on, information technology infrastructure, including elements both internal and external, to record and process a large volume of complex transactions and other data, including personally identifiable information regarding financial and health matters.  In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such data in order to assist us with responsibilities, such as producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.  Any interruptions, delays, breakdowns or breach, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches or breaches of security systems and procedures of ours or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our or our customers  intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.  In recent years, several health care and financial services firms were victims of computer systems hacking attacks, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm. Rapid advances in technology, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower, may prevent us from anticipating, identifying, preventing or addressing all potential security threats and breaches.  A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.  In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, regulatory penalties, and litigation.  

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  Stock repurchases 
    
  The following table sets forth information with respect to shares of our common stock purchased by us during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

__________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased, in accordance with the applicable equity compensation plan,   15,328   shares of our common stock for participant income tax withholding in conjunction with stock option exercises or from the vesting of restricted shares, as requested by the participants, or from shares surrendered in satisfaction of option exercise price.  These purchases were not made under the publicly announced repurchase plans or programs, but were allowed by the rules of the Compensation Committee of the DST Board of Directors.  Of these shares,   13,720   shares were purchased in   July 2016  ,   380   shares were purchased in   August 2016   and   1,228   shares were purchased in   September 2016  . 
       
           (2) 
    On June 13, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized $300.0 million of share repurchases.  This plan allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market transactions and private transactions.  The plan does not have an expiration date.  We may enter into one or more plans with our brokers or banks for pre-authorized purchases within defined limits pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 to effect all or a portion of such share repurchases.
