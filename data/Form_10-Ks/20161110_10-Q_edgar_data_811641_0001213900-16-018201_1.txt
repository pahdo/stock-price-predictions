1.   
      BUSINESS  OPERATIONS    

ImmuCell
Corporation (the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our ) is a growing animal health company
whose purpose is to create scientifically-proven and practical products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy
and beef industries. The Company was originally incorporated in Maine in 1982 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1987, in conjunction
with its initial public offering of common stock. We market products that provide immediate immunity to newborn dairy and beef
cattle. We are developing product line extensions of our existing products and are in the late stages of developing a novel product
that addresses mastitis, the most significant cause of economic loss to the dairy industry. These products help reduce the need
to use traditional antibiotics in food producing animals. The Company is subject to certain risks associated with its stage of
development including dependence on key individuals, competition from other larger companies, the successful sale of existing
products and the development and acquisition of additional commercially viable products with appropriate regulatory approvals,
where applicable. These and other risks to our company are further detailed under  PART II-OTHER INFORMATION: ITEM 1A 
RISK FACTORS .  

2.   
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

(a)    
      Basis    of Presentation    

We have prepared the accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements reflecting all adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary in order to ensure that the financial
statements are not misleading. We follow accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The FASB
sets generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition,
results of operations, earnings per share and cash flows. References to GAAP in these footnotes are to the FASB  Accounting
Standards Codification   (Codification). As described below, certain prior year accounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2016 financial statement presentation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial
statements have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, we believe that although the disclosures are adequate to ensure that the
information presented is not misleading, these unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the notes thereto, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

(b)   
       Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and
Long-Term Investments    

We
consider all highly liquid investment instruments that mature within three months of their purchase dates to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are principally invested in securities backed by the U.S. government. Certain cash balances in excess of Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limits of $250,000 per financial institution per depositor are maintained in money market
accounts at financial institutions that are secured, in part, by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Amounts in excess
of these FDIC limits per bank that are not invested in securities backed by the U.S. government aggregated $3,908,115 and $1,073,028
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We account for marketable securities in accordance with Codification
Topic 320,  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities . Short-term investments are classified as held to maturity and are
comprised principally of certificates of deposit that mature in more than three months from their purchase dates and not more
than twelve months from the balance sheet date. Long-term investments are classified as held to maturity and are comprised principally
of certificates of deposit that mature in more than twelve months from the balance sheet date. Short-term and long-term investments
are held at different financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC, within the FDIC limits per financial institution. See
Note 3.  

(c)   
       Inventory    

Inventory includes raw materials, work-in-process
and finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost, on the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value (determined
as the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and
transportation). Work-in-process and finished goods inventories include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. See Note
4. 

(d)   
       Accounts Receivable    

Accounts
receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful collection and product returns. Management
determines the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience
applied to an aging of accounts. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable
previously written off are recorded as income when received. Accounts receivable are considered to be past due if any portion
of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than 30 days. Interest is charged on past due accounts receivable.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

(e)   
       Property, Plant and Equipment    

We
depreciate property, plant and equipment on the straight-line method by charges to operations in amounts estimated to expense
the cost of the assets from the date they are first put into service to the end of the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
facility we are constructing to produce the active ingredient, Nisin, for  Mast Out      
    will be depreciated over its useful life beginning when that
facility is placed into service, which could be before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the product is achieved.
This facility is not yet placed in service. We are evaluating the estimated useful lives of the assets associated with this facility.
Repairs to fixed assets that benefit more than a current period are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives. See Note
7.  

(f)   
       Intangible Assets and Goodwill    

We
amortize intangible assets on the straight-line method by charges to operations in amounts estimated to expense the cost of
the assets from the date they are first put into service to the end of the estimated useful lives of the assets. We have
recorded intangible assets related to customer contracts, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and technology,
each with defined useful lives. We have classified as goodwill the amounts paid in excess of fair value of the net assets
(including tax attributes) of assets acquired in purchase transactions. We continually assess that these assets are
realizable in accordance with the impairment provisions of Codification Topic 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . We assess the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill that have indefinite lives on
an annual basis (as of December 31 st ) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the asset may not be recoverable. We would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that
the fair value of such assets was less than their carrying values. Judgement is required in determining whether an event has
occurred that may impair the value of identifiable intangible assets or goodwill. Factors that could indicate that an
impairment may exist include significant under-performance relative to plan or long-term projections, significant changes in
business strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends. Although we believe intangible assets and goodwill are
appropriately stated in the accompanying financial statements, changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly
impact these judgements and require an adjustment to the recorded balance. See Notes 2(h), 8 and 9 for additional
disclosures.  

(g)   
       Fair Value Measurements    

In
determining fair value measurements, we follow the provisions of Codification Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
Codification Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and enhances disclosures
about fair value measurements. The topic provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on an exit price, which
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The topic also prioritizes, within the measurement of fair value, the use of market-based
information over entity-specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the
nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. The three-level hierarchy is as follows:  

Level
    1 -  
      Pricing
    inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.   

Level 2 -  
       Pricing
        inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
        for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data.    

Level 3 -  
       Pricing
                                                                                                              inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities, that is, inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own
                                                                                                              assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

ImmuCell Corporation  

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)   

In
certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases,
an asset s or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgement, and considers factors specific to the investment.  

Our
held to maturity securities are comprised of investments in bank certificates of deposit. The value of these securities is disclosed
in Note 3. We also hold money market mutual funds in a brokerage account, which are classified as cash equivalents and measured
at fair value. The fair value of these investments is based on their closing published net asset value.  

We
assess the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date
of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with our accounting policy regarding the recognition
of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
December 31, 2015, there were no transfers between levels. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our interest rate swap
agreements and bank certificates of deposit were classified as Level 2. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Level
1 assets measured at fair value consisted of bank savings accounts and money market funds valued at $4,408,415 and $1,573,328,
respectively, and our Level 2 assets measured at fair value consisted of bank certificates of deposit of $5,199,000 and $4,951,000,
respectively. There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016, or
December 31, 2015.  

(h)   
       Valuation of Long-Lived Assets    

We
periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, consisting principally of fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets for potential
impairment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the treatment of long-lived assets, we review the carrying
value of our long-lived assets or asset group that is held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for
impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Under the
held and used approach, the asset or asset group to be tested for impairment should represent the lowest level for which identifiable
cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our long-lived assets
whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows. No impairment was recognized during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 or 2015.  

(i)   
       Concentration of Risk    

Concentration of credit risk with respect
to accounts receivable is principally limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales. To reduce risk, we routinely
assess the financial strength of our customers and, as a consequence, believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure
is limited. We maintain an allowance for potential credit losses, but historically we have not experienced significant credit
losses related to an individual customer or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. Sales to significant
customers that amounted to 10% or more of total product sales are detailed in the following table: 

-  7  - 

ImmuCell Corporation  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

Accounts
receivable due from significant customers amounted to the percentages of total trade accounts receivable as detailed in the following
table:  

(1) 
During June 2015, Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ: PDCO) acquired Animal Health International, Inc.  

   (2)  During
March 2015, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) acquired MWI Animal Health.  

   (3)  Assumes
that the acquisition of Animal Medic by ANIMART LLC (which closed during the third quarter of 2016) had occurred as of the
beginning of the periods being reported.  

*Amount
is less than 10%.  

We
believe that supplies and raw materials for the production of our products are available from more than one vendor or farm. Our
policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used in our products. However, there is a risk that we
could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies.  

(j)   
       Interest Rate Swap Agreements    

All
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. We entered into interest rate swap agreements in 2010 and
2015. On the dates the agreements were entered into, we designated the derivatives as hedges of the variability of cash flows
to be paid related to our long-term debt. The agreements have been determined to be highly effective in hedging the variability
of identified cash flows, so changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap agreements are recorded as comprehensive
income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g. when periodic settlements on a variable-rate
asset or liability are recorded in earnings). We formally documented the relationship between the interest rate swap agreements
and the related hedged items. We also formally assess, both at the interest rate swap agreements  inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the agreements are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of hedged items. See Note 11.  

(k)   
       Revenue Recognition    

We
sell products that provide immediate immunity to newborn dairy and beef cattle. We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104,  Revenue Recognition . SAB No. 104 requires that four criteria are met before revenue
is recognized. These include i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, ii) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, iii) the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue
at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products, as title and risk of loss pass to the customer
on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectability is reasonably assured. We offer a 50% credit on  First
Defense     product that is returned to us past its expiration date, which is generally two years past its date of manufacture.
We generally experience a minimal amount of product returns.  

(l)   
       Expense Recognition    

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred,
which is generally during the month in which the advertisement is published. Advertising expenses amounted to $50,079 and $27,545
during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $88,017 and $72,539 during the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All product development expenses are expensed as incurred, as are all related patent costs. We
capitalize costs to produce inventory during the production cycle, and these costs are charged to costs of goods sold when the
inventory is sold to a customer.

ImmuCell Corporation  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

(m)   
       Income Taxes    

We
account for income taxes in accordance with Codification Topic 740,  Income Taxes , which requires that we recognize a current
tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We believe it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and future tax effects of temporary differences between
book income and taxable income. Accordingly, we have not established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets. Codification
Topic 740-10 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position must
meet before being recognized in the financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue
Service and other taxing authorities. Our tax returns for the years 2013 through 2015 are subject to audit. We have evaluated
the positions taken on our filed tax returns. We have concluded that no uncertain tax positions exist as of September 30, 2016.
Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. See Note 14.  

(n)   
       Stock-Based Compensation    

We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Codification Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation , which
generally requires us to recognize non-cash compensation expense for stock-based payments using the fair-value-based method. The
fair value of each stock option grant has been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Accordingly,
we recorded compensation expense pertaining to stock-based compensation of $21,360 and $6,342 during the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $50,312 and $17,825 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
which resulted in a decrease to income before income taxes of less than $0.01 per share during each of the periods reported.  

(o)   
       Net Income Per Common Share    

Net
income per common share has been computed in accordance with Codification Topic 260-10,  Earnings Per Share.  The basic net
income per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during this
period. The diluted net income per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period plus all outstanding stock options with an exercise price that is less than the average market price of the
common stock during the period less the number of shares that could have been repurchased at this average market price with the
proceeds from the hypothetical stock option exercises. The weighted average and diluted number of shares outstanding consisted
of the following:  

(p)   
       Use of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although we regularly assess these
estimates, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded during the period in which
they become known. Significant estimates include our inventory, goodwill, accrued expenses and costs of goods sold accounts
as well as amortization of our intangible assets.  

(q)   
       New Accounting Pronouncements     

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires
an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU
2014-09 was initially to become effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. Early application was not permitted. In July 2015,
the FASB approved a one-year deferral in the effective date to January 1, 2018, with the option of applying the standard on the
original effective date. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are
evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 would have on our financial statements and related disclosures.

ImmuCell Corporation  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest , which requires that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. This update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. During
the first quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and reclassified $40,792 of debt issuance costs (net) from other assets to a
reduction in our bank debt liability as of December 31, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB confirmed that ASU No. 2015-03 did not
address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. For line-of-credit
arrangements, borrowers have the option of presenting debt issuance costs as an asset which is subsequently amortized ratably
over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any related outstanding borrowings. ASU No. 2015-03
did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
 Inventory , which simplifies the existing guidance which requires entities to subsequently measure inventory at the lower
of cost or market value. Under ASU No. 2015-11, an entity should measure inventory valued using a first-in, first-out or average
cost method at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course
of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for public
business entities during fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2015-11 during the third quarter of 2016,
and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes , which simplifies the existing guidance which requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. Under ASU No. 2015-17, an entity should classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as one noncurrent
deferred tax liability or asset (net) within the statement of financial position. The amendments apply to all entities that present
a classified statement of financial position and are effective for the public business entities for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Earlier application is permitted. During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted
ASU No. 2015-17 early and reclassified $19,588 of current deferred tax liabilities to long-term, which amount was netted against
our long-term deferred tax asset, as of December 31, 2015. ASU No. 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases , which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheet
but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today s accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. We are not subject
to material lease obligations, and we do not expect ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on our financial statements.

 As of September 30, 2016, construction in progress included $650,733 in payments related to the construction of our commercial-scale
Nisin plant. As of December 31, 2015, construction in progress consisted principally of partial payments towards new manufacturing
equipment related to expanding our production capacity for  First Defense    .  

8.   
       BUSINESS ACQUISITION    

On January 4, 2016, we acquired certain business
assets from DAY 1  Technology, LLC of Minnesota. The acquired rights and know-how are primarily related to formulating our
bovine antibodies into a gel solution for an oral delivery option to newborn calves via a syringe (or tube). This product format
offers customers an alternative delivery option to the bolus (the standard delivery format of the bivalent  First Defense    
  product since first approval by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and product launch in 1991) and could allow
more market penetration. The formulation was developed for us and has been sold as a feed product without disease claims since
2012. This purchase also includes certain other related private-label products. The total purchase price was approximately $532,000.
Approximately $368,000 of this amount was paid as of the closing date. A technology transfer payment of $97,000 was made during
the third quarter of 2016, and the remaining estimated balance of approximately $67,000 will be paid as a royalty on related product
sales through December 31, 2018. There is no limit on the amount of the royalty, but it is proportional to sales of related product.
That amount is reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheet. The estimated fair values
of the assets purchased in this transaction included inventory of $113,000, machinery and equipment of $132,000, a developed technology
intangible of $191,000 (which includes an immaterial amount of value associated with customer relationships and a non-compete
agreement, and was valued using the relief from royalty method) and goodwill of $96,000. The intangible assets and goodwill are
deductible for tax return purposes. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the estimated value of anticipated
growth opportunities arising from synergies and efficiencies. The measurement period for the transaction was closed as of June
30, 2016, and we continue to assess any impairment of these acquired assets quarterly. The impact of the acquisition on our proforma
prior year operations is not significant.

       INTANGIBLE ASSETS     

The intangible assets described in Note 8
are being amortized over their useful lives, which are estimated to be 10 years. Intangible amortization expense was ($133) and
$15,309 during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The immaterial credit to amortization
expense during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 resulted from an adjustment to correct an immaterial over-recognition
of this expense during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. The net value of these intangibles was $175,731 as of September
30, 2016. A summary of intangible amortization expense estimated for the five years beginning January 1, 2016 and thereafter is
as follows:

       ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES    

Accounts
payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following:  

During
the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a bank debt agreement covering certain additional credit facilities with TD Bank N.A.
aggregating approximately $4.5 million comprised of: (a) a $2.5 million construction loan, drawable over an 18-month period at
up to 80% of the cost of equipment installed in the to be constructed commercial-scale production facility for  Mast Out    ,
during which interest only will be payable at a variable rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25%, which converts to a seven-year
term loan facility at the end of construction at the same interest rate with monthly principal and interest payments based on
a seven-year amortization schedule and (b) a $2.0 million construction loan, drawable over a 12-month period at up to 75% of the
appraised value of the to be constructed commercial-scale production facility for  Mast Out    , during which
interest only will be payable at a variable rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25%, which converts to a nine-year term loan
facility at the end of construction at the same interest rate with monthly principal and interest payments based on a twenty-year
amortization schedule. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of September 30, 2016.  These credit facilities are to be secured by substantially all of our assets and are subject to certain
financial covenants.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

Additionally,
we have in place certain credit facilities with TD Bank N.A., which are secured by substantially all of our assets and are subject
to certain financial covenants. Proceeds from the $1,000,000 mortgage note were received during the third quarter of 2010. Based
on a 15-year amortization schedule, a balloon principal payment of approximately $451,885 will be due during the third quarter
of 2020. Proceeds from the $2,500,000 mortgage note were received during the third quarter of 2015. Based on a 20-year amortization
schedule, a balloon principal payment of approximately $1,550,007 will be due during the third quarter of 2025. Principal payments
due under debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016 (excluding any debt proceeds to be drawn under the credit facilities entered
into during the first quarter of 2016) are reflected in the following table by the year that payments are due:  

We
hedged our interest rate exposure on these mortgage notes with interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted floating
interest rates based on the one-month LIBOR plus a bank profit margin of 3.25% and 2.25% to the fixed rates of 6.04% and 4.38%,
respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the variable rates on these two mortgage notes were 3.78% and 2.79%, respectively. All
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. At the time of the closings and thereafter, the agreements
were determined to be highly effective in hedging the variability of the identified cash flows and have been designated as cash
flow hedges of the variability in the hedged interest payments. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements
are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. The original notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements
of $1,000,000 and $2,500,000 amortize in accordance with the amortization of the mortgage notes. The notional amount of the interest
rate swaps was $3,126,004 as of September 30, 2016. Payments required by the interest rate swaps totaled $14,470 and $5,112 during
the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $44,653 and $15,549 during the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As the result of our decision to hedge this interest rate risk, we recorded other comprehensive
income (loss), net of taxes, in the amount of $15,523 and ($49,147) during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, and ($79,767) and ($48,059) during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reflects
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap (liabilities), net of taxes. The fair values of the interest rate swaps
have been determined using observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Accordingly,
the interest rate swaps are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy provided in Codification Topic 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures .  

In
connection with the credit facilities entered into during the third quarters of 2010 and 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we
incurred debt issue costs of $26,489, $34,125 and $46,734, respectively, which costs are being recorded as a component of other
expenses over the terms of the credit facilities.  

Proceeds
from a $600,000 note bearing interest at 4.25% were received during the first quarter of 2011. This note was repaid during the
third quarter of 2015.  

The
$500,000 line of credit with TD Bank N.A. was first entered into during the third quarter of 2010 and has been renewed approximately
annually since then and is available as needed and has been extended through May 31, 2017 and is renewable annually thereafter.
The line of credit was unused as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Interest on any borrowings against the line of credit
would be variable at the higher of 4.25% per annum or the one-month LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum.  

12.   
       STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY    

On
October 28, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC for the potential issuance of up to $10,000,000 in
equity (subject to certain limitations). This registration statement became effective on November 10, 2015. Under this form of
registration statement, we were limited to raising gross proceeds of no more than one-third of the market capitalization of our
common stock (as determined by the high price within the preceding 60 days leading up to a sale of securities) held by non-affiliates
(non-insiders) of the Company within a twelve-month period. This limit was approximately $5,958,000, based on the closing price
of $8.08 per share as of January 6, 2016. On February 3, 2016, we sold 1,123,810 shares of common stock at a price to the public
of $5.25 per share in an underwritten public offering, raising gross proceeds of approximately $5,900,000, resulting in net proceeds
of approximately $5,313,000 (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) to the Company.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

At
the June 15, 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders voted to approve an amendment to the Company s Certificate
of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000.  

In
June 2000, our stockholders approved the 2000 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the  2000 Plan ) pursuant to the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, under which employees and certain service providers may be granted options to purchase shares
of the Company s common stock at i) no less than fair market value on the date of grant in the case of incentive stock options
and ii) no less than 85% of fair market value on the date of grant in the case of non-qualified stock options. Vesting requirements
are determined by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors on a case by case basis. Originally, 250,000
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. The stockholders of the Company approved an increase in
this number to 500,000 shares in June 2001. All options granted under the 2000 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date
of grant. The 2000 Plan expired in February 2010, after which date no further options could be granted under the 2000 Plan. However,
outstanding options under the 2000 Plan may be exercised in accordance with their terms.  

In
June 2010, our stockholders approved the 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the  2010 Plan ) pursuant to the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, under which employees and certain service providers may be granted options to purchase shares
of the Company s common stock at i) no less than fair market value on the date of grant in the case of incentive stock options
and ii) no less than 85% of fair market value on the date of grant in the case of non-qualified stock options. At that time, 300,000
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan and subsequently no additional shares have been reserved
for the 2010 Plan. Vesting requirements are determined by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors
on a case by case basis. All options granted under the 2010 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.  

Activity
under the stock option plans described above was as follows:  

-  15  - 

ImmuCell Corporation  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)  

During the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, one employee and one director exercised stock options covering the aggregate of 16,000 shares, of which 15,000 were
exercised during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. Six thousand of these options were exercised for cash, resulting
in total proceeds of $31,900, and 10,000 of these options were exercised by the surrender of 7,334 shares of common stock with
a fair market value of $57,425 at the time of exercise and $75 in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2015, eleven employees
exercised stock options covering the aggregate of 28,000 shares, of which 14,000 were exercised during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015. These options were exercised for cash, resulting in total proceeds of $120,210. At September 30, 2016,
261,000 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under all outstanding stock options described above, and an additional
150,500 shares of common stock were reserved for the potential issuance of stock option grants in the future under the 2010 Plan.
The weighted average remaining life of the options outstanding under the 2000 Plan and the 2010 Plan as of September 30, 2016
was approximately four years and seven months. The weighted average remaining life of the options exercisable under these plans
as of September 30, 2016 was approximately two years and six months. The exercise prices of the options outstanding as of September
30, 2016 ranged from $1.70 to $8.21 per share. The 44,000 stock options granted during the first nine months of 2016 had exercise
prices between $6.70 and $8.21 per share. The 16,000 stock options granted during 2015 had exercise prices between $6.05 and $7.54
per share. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2016 and 2015 approximated $32,000 and $110,000, respectively.
The weighted-average grant date fair values of options granted during 2016 and 2015 were $4.16 and $3.46 per share, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016, total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to non-vested stock options aggregated $238,047.
That cost is expected to be recognized at a declining rate through the second quarter of 2023 (the remaining vesting period of
the outstanding non-vested stock options), including $25,270 during remainder of 2016. The fair value of each stock option grant
has been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, for the purpose discussed in Note 2(n),
with the following weighted-average assumptions for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and for the
year ended December 31, 2015: 

The
risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected option term, while the other
assumptions are derived from averages of our historical data.  

Other
expenses, net, consisted of the following:  

Our
income tax (benefit) expense aggregated ($10,913) and $260,447 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our income tax expense aggregated $211,537 and $709,394 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. In 2015, we utilized approximately $1,700,000 of net operating loss carryforwards to offset otherwise taxable
income. As of December 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $115,000 that we expect to utilize
against taxable income in 2016. Additionally, we have federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $262,000
that expire in 2027 through 2034, if not utilized before then, as well as approximately $78,000 of state tax credits.  

Deferred
tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in future periods against
which deductible temporary differences and credits may be utilized. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset could be reduced
if projected income is not achieved due to various factors, such as unfavorable business conditions. If projected income is not
expected to be achieved, we would decrease the deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe can be realized.  

Net
operating loss carryforwards, credits, and other tax attributes are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal
Revenue Service. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that could place annual limitations on the future
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, as defined.  

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and several state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company
is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. We currently have no tax examinations
in progress. We also have not paid additional taxes, interest or penalties as a result of tax examinations nor do we have any
unrecognized tax benefits for any of the periods in the accompanying financial statements.

15.   
       CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS    

Our
bylaws, as amended, in effect provide that the Company will indemnify its officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted
by Delaware law. In addition, we make similar indemnity undertakings to each director through a separate indemnification agreement
with that director. The maximum payment that we may be required to make under such provisions is theoretically unlimited and is
impossible to determine. We maintain directors  and officers  liability insurance, which may provide reimbursement
to the Company for payments made to, or on behalf of, officers and directors pursuant to the indemnification provisions. Our indemnification
obligations were grandfathered under the provisions of Codification Topic 460 , Guarantees . Accordingly, we have recorded
no liability for such obligations as of September 30, 2016. Since our incorporation, we have had no occasion to make any indemnification
payment to any of our officers or directors for any reason.  

The
development, manufacturing and marketing of animal health care products entails an inherent risk that liability claims will be
asserted against us during the normal course of business. We feel that we have reasonable levels of liability insurance to support
our operations. We are aware of no such claims against us as of the date of this filing.  

We
enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third
parties from and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement.
In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically
unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis
of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of the liabilities potentially arising under these agreements
is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for such obligations as of September 30, 2016.  

We
are committed to purchasing certain key parts (syringes) and services (formulation, filling and packaging of Drug Product) pertaining
to  Mast Out     exclusively from two contractors.  If we do not commercialize the product by the end of
2019, we would be liable for a $100,000 termination fee .   

During
the second quarter of 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with the Baylor College of Medicine covering the underlying rotavirus
vaccine technology used to generate the specific antibodies for our product line extension that is under development. This perpetual
license (if not terminated for cause) is subject to a milestone payment of $150,000 upon regulatory approval and a royalty based
on sales related to this technology.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had committed approximately $417,000 to capital expenditures, $541,000 to the production of inventory
and an additional $159,000 to other obligations. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a guaranteed
maximum price contract with our construction management firm in the amount of approximately $5,000,000 covering construction costs
for the new production facility for  Mast Out    . This contract includes provisions that could reduce the amount of the
commitment generally by the amount not expended or committed by the construction manager at the time of an unexpected and unlikely
early termination.

       SEGMENT INFORMATION    

We
principally operate in the business segment described in Note 1. Pursuant to Codification Topic 280,  Segment Reporting ,
we operate in one reportable business segment, that being the development, acquisition, manufacture and sale of products that
improve the health and productivity of cows for the dairy and beef industries. Almost all of our internally funded product development
expenses are in support of such products. The significant accounting policies of this segment are described in Note 2. Sales of
the  First Defense     product line aggregated 93% and 88% or our total product sales during the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and 93% and 92% of our total product sales during the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Our
primary customers for the majority of our product sales (83% and 85% for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 and 85% and 83% for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively) are in the U.S. dairy and beef
industries. Product sales to international customers, who are also in the dairy and beef industries, aggregated 17% and 6% of
our total product sales for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and 14% and 13% of our total product sales
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We
have a 401(k) savings plan (the Plan) in which all employees completing one month of service with the Company are eligible to
participate. Participants may contribute up to the maximum amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. Since August 2012,
we have matched 100% of the first 3% of each employee s salary that is contributed to the Plan and 50% of the next 2% of
each employee s salary that is contributed to the Plan. Under this matching plan, we paid $17,642 and $17,102 into the Plan
during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $55,209 and $54,157 during the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

We
have adopted the disclosure provisions of Codification Topic 855-10-50-1,  Subsequent Events , which provides guidance to
establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued. Entities are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated as well as the
rationale for why that date was selected. This disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not
evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented. Codification Topic 855-10-50-1
requires additional disclosures only, and therefore did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations,
earnings per share or cash flows. Public entities must evaluate subsequent events through the date that financial statements are
issued. Accordingly, we have evaluated subsequent events through the time of filing on November 10, 2016, the date we have issued
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of such date, except as described below, there were no material, reportable subsequent
events.  

On
October 21, 2016, we closed on a private placement of 659,880 shares of common stock to nineteen institutional and accredited
investors at $5.25 per share, raising gross proceeds of $3,464,000. The net proceeds were approximately $3,164,000 after deducting
placement agent fees and other estimated expenses incurred in connection with the equity financing.  

We
expect to close down the rented facility in Minnesota that has been used to produce the gel solution format of our product
and the certain other related private-label products by year end. This will result in the termination of employment of four
employees for us, as these production functions are consolidated into our Portland facility. Consolidation of this product
line in Portland enables us to leverage existing infrastructure and larger scale equipment to improve operating
efficiencies.

ITEM
2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Financial
Condition   

Our
strategy is focused on developing and selling products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries.
We aim to capitalize on the significant growth in sales of  First Defense     and to revolutionize the mastitis
treatment paradigm. We have funded most of our product development expenses principally from our gross margin on product sales.
As anticipated, we incurred a net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an unusually large investment in a pilot
plant for  Mast Out    . After completing this investment, we did return to profitability, as planned, during
the six-month period ended December 31, 2014 and continued this profitability throughout 2015 and for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016. The table below summarizes the changes in selected, key accounts (in thousands, except for percentages):  

(1)
 This balance does not include approximately $343,000 being held temporarily in escrow against certain construction performance
requirements related to our production facility for  Mast Out    .  

Net
cash provided by operating activities amounted to $48,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison
to net cash provided by operating activities of $2,070,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Capital investments
totaled $1,795,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to capital investments of $1,772,000 during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. As we progress our investment in the production facility for  Mast Out    described below, we expect these investments of cash to increase. Together with gross margin earned from ongoing product
sales, we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our working capital requirements and to finance our ongoing
business operations during at least the next twelve months.  

During
the third quarters of 2010 and 2015, we agreed to terms of certain credit facilities with TD Bank, N.A., which are secured by
substantially all of our assets including our building, which was independently appraised at $4,180,000 in connection with the
2015 financing. As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding bank debt balance was approximately $3,126,000. We have a $500,000 line
of credit that is available as needed. These credit facilities are subject to certain financial covenants and are secured by substantially
all of our assets. Based on our unaudited results, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2016.  

During
the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a bank debt agreement covering certain additional credit facilities with TD Bank N.A.
aggregating approximately $4.5 million comprised of: (a) a $2.5 million construction loan, drawable over an 18-month period at
up to 80% of the cost of equipment installed in the to be constructed commercial-scale production facility for  Mast Out    ,
which converts to a seven-year term loan facility at the end of construction with monthly principal and interest payments based
on a seven-year amortization schedule and (b) a $2.0 million construction loan, drawable over a 12-month period at up to 75% of
the appraised value of the to be constructed commercial-scale production facility for  Mast Out    , which converts
to a nine-year term loan facility at the end of construction with monthly principal and interest payments based on a twenty-year
amortization schedule. As of September 30, 2016, we had not drawn proceeds under either of these credit facilities. These credit
facilities are subject to certain financial covenants and are secured by substantially all of our assets. We are in compliance
with all applicable convenants as of September 30, 2016. At this point, we anticipate drawing funds under the $2.5 million construction
loan during the second quarter of 2017 and drawing funds under the $2.0 million construction loan during the first quarter of
2017. These credit facilities may be effectively converted to fixed rate loans when proceeds are drawn (at our option) by entering
into interest rate swap agreements.  

During
2016, we issued the aggregate of 1,783,690 shares of common stock raising net proceeds of approximately $8,477,000 in two separate
equity transactions. During the first quarter of 2016, we sold 1,123,810 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $5.25
per share in an underwritten public offering, raising gross proceeds of approximately $5,900,000. The net proceeds from this first
equity financing were approximately $5,313,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. During the fourth
quarter of 2016, we sold 659,880 shares of common stock at $5.25 per share in a private placement to nineteen institutional and
accredited investors, raising gross proceeds of approximately $3,464,000. The net proceeds from this second equity financing were
approximately $3,164,000 after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated expenses.

During
the third quarter of 2016, we initiated construction of our pharmaceutical facility to produce Nisin, the active ingredient in
 Mast Out   .  The estimated total cost of the Nisin facility is approximately $20,000,000. The spend on this
project is heavily weighted to the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017. We expect to fund remaining costs in excess of our
current cash and investments with cash to be generated from operations during 2016 to 2018, borrowings under the credit facilities
described above and possibly some incremental bank debt (as to which we do not presently have binding lending commitments in place).
These costs are being capitalized on our balance sheet as construction in progress. Depreciation of these costs is expected to
begin when the facility is placed into service, which could be before FDA approval of the product is achieved. The following table
details the amount and timing of the expected investment:  

(1) 
We expect most of this investment to be disbursed during the nine-month period ending June 30, 2017.  

   (2)
 This budget estimate does not include approximately $278,000 that was invested in land for the facility, which was acquired
during the fourth quarter of 2015.  

During
the third quarter of 2016, the City of Portland approved a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) credit enhancement package that reduces
our real estate taxes on the  Mast Out     facility that we are constructing by 65% over the first eleven years
and by 30% during the 12th year, after which time the rebate expires. The TIF is still subject to standard approvals by the State s
Department of Economic and Community Development. The aggregate financial benefit was originally estimated to be approximately
$400,000 based on the then current $3,000,000 building cost estimate calculated during 2015 before the detailed design work and
construction bidding was complete. Significant process-directed requirements to the building have since increased the estimated
construction costs to approximately $11,000,000. We believe the cost per square foot as currently estimated for a facility of
this purpose is competitive and that the increase is largely the result of the preliminary engineering estimate from 2015 for
a building shell being for much less of a structure that would not have satisfied our regulatory and Nisin production capacity
needs. The value of the tax savings would increase in proportion to the increase in the cost of the building as assessed for city
real estate tax purposes. The actual savings will be based on the assessed value of the building after construction is complete,
which is likely to be less than its cost of construction, but significantly more than $3,000,000. For example, an assessed value
of $7,000,000 could generate a tax rebate of approximately $1,200,000 over the life of the TIF.  

During the 18-month period
ended June 30, 2016, we invested approximately $3,600,000 in capital expenditures including the completion of a 7,100 square foot
facility addition (described below) and installation of a second freeze dryer, among other investments. We completed the investment
to increase our liquid processing capacity by 50% during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the investment to increase our freeze-drying
capacity by 100% at the end of the first quarter of 2016. These investments were necessary to increase our manufacturing capacity
to fill the backlog of  First Defense     orders and to meet the increased sales demand that we are anticipating.
These investments do not include cash budgeted for construction of the commercial-scale production facility for  Mast Out    described
above. As of October 1, 2016, we had additional authorization from our Board of Directors to spend up to approximately $715,000
for new manufacturing equipment and other routine and necessary capital expenditures and to prepare for the launch of a trivalent
product format of  First Defense   .  

During
the third quarter of 2013, our Board of Directors approved the aggregate investment of approximately $3,000,000 in two projects.
The first investment involved acquiring processing equipment and modifying a portion of our facility to create a pilot production
plant for the  Mast Out     product development initiative. These expenses were not capitalized because this plant was
not expected to support commercial sales. Construction of the facility addition was substantially completed during the third quarter
of 2014. This specifically targeted increase in product development expenses resulted in a net loss during the first six months
of 2014. The second investment involved acquiring manufacturing equipment and constructing a two-story addition to our facility,
providing us with approximately 7,100 square feet of cold storage, production and warehouse space to increase our commercial production
capacity for  First Defense     and other products. Construction of the facility addition was initiated at the end of
the third quarter of 2014 and was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2015. These expenses have been capitalized
as they support the commercial sale of our existing products. The following table details the spending on these two projects,
which were completed on budget:

Product
sales during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 20%, or $504,000, to $1,968,000 from $2,472,000 during
the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. Product sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased
by 3%, or $204,000, to $7,330,000 from $7,534,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. While sales decreased
by $504,000 and $204,000 during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, (in comparison
to the same periods during the prior year), there are many other important factors that should be considered when assessing the
long-term health of our business. Product sales during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased by 3%, or $285,000,
to $10,025,000 from $9,740,000 during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2015. During the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, domestic product sales decreased by less than 1%, or $46,000, and international sales decreased by 13%, or $158,000,
in comparison to the same period in 2015. The decrease in international sales was more a result of how we chose to allocate scarce
product than a factor of reduced demand. After a prolonged period of order backlog, we had no backlog of orders as of September
30, 2016 in comparison to backlogs of the following:  

The
prolonged period of order backlog (which began early in 2015 and extended through the middle of 2016) created a significant disruption
in our sales shipment pattern. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were up 35% in comparison to the year ended December
31, 2014. This strong growth trend has not continued into the second half of 2016, in comparison to the respective period during
2015, but sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were 36% greater than sales during the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2014 (skipping over the same period in 2015), demonstrating a positive longer-term sales trend. We believe the sales
declines in the current periods are largely related to the short-term negative impact related to emerging from the backlog situation,
and we remain optimistic about the long-term health of our business.  

We
continue to make significant progress on several product development objectives that may help us increase sales. We have obtained
concurrence from the USDA that we have been granted disease claims against bovine rotavirus for our new product, which would be
the first calf level product to offer this unique breadth of claims. We are now working to complete the other laboratory and manufacturing
objectives required for product license approval, which we hope to earn in 2017. We are currently working to establish USDA claims
for our gel tube formulation of  First Defense Technology   and to add a  C. perfringens  claim to our product
line. With our increased production capacity, we have begun to seek additional distributor partnerships to bring  First Defense    into
new international territories. These long-term growth plans could more than offset recent market dynamics that are significantly
impacting our financial results during the second half of 2016, such as:  

Customer
                                         order patterns were disrupted during the prolonged period of order backlog from first
                                         quarter of 2015 until the early part of the third quarter of 2016.   
 
       After
                                         completing a significant investment to double  First Defense     production
                                         capacity during early 2016, the distribution chain was re-supplied with product largely
                                         during the second quarter of 2016.   
 
       When
                                         customers were unable to secure supply of  First Defense    , some
                                         moved to other products (with and without claims), and some opted to use no scours preventative
                                         at all.

A
                                         competitive product, that experienced interrupted supply to the market during late 2014
                                         and through the first half of 2015, has returned to the market. Some customers have reverted
                                         back to using this product.   
 
       The
                                         Company s sales team needs to regain momentum lost when it was not able to focus
                                         on acquiring new customers during the period of scarce product supply.   
 
       Based
                                         on our informal survey of market sources, the value of a bull calf has dropped from approximately
                                         $450 last year to about $50 to $200 presently.   
 
       The
                                         average Class III milk price has declined from $15.80 per hundred pounds during 2015
                                         (compared to $22.34 for 2014) to $14.38 during the first nine months of 2016. The average
                                         price of $13.48 during the first six months of the year increased to $16.18 during the
                                         third quarter of 2016.     

During
the first quarter of 2016, we completed an investment to double our production capacity of  First Defense    .
This doubling allowed us to fill a backlog of orders that had persisted since the first quarter of 2015. Having now re-set distributor
inventory levels after a long period of order backlog and as we compare current results to a 2015 period during which a competitor
was largely out of the market, we do not expect to experience sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our lead product,
 First Defense    , continues to benefit from wide acceptance by dairy and beef producers as an effective tool
to prevent bovine enteritis (scours) in newborn calves. Now that we are building stocks of inventory held available for shipment,
our increased investment in sales and marketing expenses will be valuable as we work to re-engage lost customers and introduce
 First Defense     to new customers. We are selling new product applications of  First Defense   
 under the description  First Defense Technology  , which is a unique whey protein concentrate that is processed
utilizing our proprietary milk protein purification methods, for the nutritional and feed supplement markets in different formats
without the claims of our USDA-licensed product. During the first quarter of 2011, we initiated sales of  First Defense Technology TM
  in a bulk powder format (no capsule), which is delivered with a scoop and mixed with colostrum for feeding to calves.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Milk Products, LLC of Chilton, Wisconsin launched commercial sales of their product, Ultra
Start    150 Plus and certain similar private label products, which are colostrum replacers with  First Defense
Technology  Inside . During the first quarter of 2012, we launched a tube delivery format of our  First Defense
Technology   in a gel solution. Sales of the  First Defense     product line aggregated 93%
and 88% of our total sales during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and 93% and 92% of our total sales
during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of the  First Defense    product
line decreased by 16%, or $339,000, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the same period in
2015. Despite a decline during the third quarter, sales of the  First Defense     product line increased by 2% during the
six-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the six-month period ended September 30, 2015. Sales of the  First Defense    
product line decreased by 2%, or $143,000, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the same
period in 2015. Sales of the  First Defense     product line increased by 4%, or $317,000, during the twelve-month
period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the same period ended September 30, 2015. Sales of the  First Defense   
 product line increased by 36%, 27% and 14% during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in comparison
to the prior years. We have realized positive sales growth of the  First Defense     product line for twenty-one
of the last twenty-four quarters, in comparison to the same quarters of the prior year. This new level of sales demand for  First
Defense     exceeded our production capacity and available inventory.  

We
believe that the long-term growth in sales of the  First Defense     product line may reflect, at least in part, the
success of our strategic decision initiated in 2010 to invest in additional sales and marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing
team currently consists of a vice president, five regional managers and an inside sales and customer service representative. Our
facility manager processes all shipments. We launched a new communications campaign at the end of 2010 that continues to emphasize
how the unique ability of  First Defense     to provide  Immediate Immunity   generates a dependable return on
investment for dairy and beef producers. Preventing newborn calves from becoming sick helps them to reach their genetic potential.  

Competition
for resources that dairy producers allocate to their calf enterprises has increased due to the many new products that have been
introduced to the calf market. Our sales are normally seasonal, with higher sales expected during the first quarter and lower
sales expected during the second and third quarters. Such seasonality is heavily influenced by the beef calving season. Warm and
dry weather reduces the producer s perception of the need for a disease preventative product like  First Defense    ,
but heat stress on calves caused by extremely hot summer weather can increase the incidence of scours. Harsher winter weather
benefits our sales. The animal health distribution segment has been aggressively consolidating over the last few years. Larger
distributors have been acquiring smaller distributors. Beef herd numbers were reduced because of the 2012 drought conditions in
many parts of North America. This resulted in an increase in the value of newborn calves, as producers re-build their herd levels.
Such an upswing increased a producer s likelihood to invest in  First Defense     for their calf crop.  

During
the first quarter of 2008, we implemented a modest increase to the selling price of  First Defense    . We did not implement
another price increase for  First Defense    until the third quarter of 2014. During 2015, we implemented an
increase to the selling price of  First Defense Technology  . The selling price for  Wipe Out    
 Dairy   Wipes  was increased effective January 1, 2016. Effective for orders placed after April 1, 2016, we implemented
a price increase of approximately 5% for  First Defense    .

We
sell topical wipes that are pre-moistened with a Nisin-based formulation (our second leading source of product sales) in two product
formats. Since 1999, we have been selling  Wipe Out    Dairy Wipes  for use in preparing the teat area of a cow for
milking. We are competing against less expensive products and alternative teat sanitizing methods. We believe that sales growth
potential for  Wipe Out    Dairy Wipes  is limited because most of our sales of this product tend to be to smaller dairies
that are under continued financial pressures, forcing many small dairy producers out of business. While our product is a high
quality tool, there are less expensive ways to sanitize a cow s udder prior to milking, and many producers opt for a less
expensive solution. During the first quarter of 2013, we initiated sales of Nisin-based wipes for pets in a 120-count canister
(Preva  wipes) to Bayer HealthCare Animal Health of St. Joseph, Missouri for commercial sales to pet owners. Sales of the
topical wipes product line (both product formats) decreased by 49%, or $54,000, during the three-month period ended September
30, 2016 in comparison to the same period in 2015. Sales of the topical wipes product line increased by 10%, or $24,000, during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the same period in 2015. Sales of the topical wipes product line
aggregated 3% and 4% of total sales during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and 4% and 3% of total product
sales during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Sales
of the new private label products (our third leading source of product sales during 2016) that we acquired in January 2016 aggregated
2% and 3% of our total sales during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These products
generally are comprised of nutritional feed ingredients delivered via a tube or capsule.  

Sales
of our  California Mastitis Test (CMT)  aggregated approximately 2% and 1% of total sales during the three-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and 1% and 2% of total sales during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

We
make and sell bulk reagents for Isolate  (formerly known as Crypto-Scan   ), which is a drinking water test that is sold
by our distributor in Europe. No sales of Isolate  were made during the first nine months of 2016. Sales of Isolate 
aggregated 7% and 3% of total sales during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

September 30, 2015. The gross margin was 61% and 59% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This compares
to gross margin percentages of 51% and 57% during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our objective has
been to maintain the full-year gross margin percentage over 50%, and we have achieved this annual objective since 2009. Going
forward, we may be able to increase this target to approximately 55%. A number of factors account for the variability in our costs,
resulting in some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter. The gross margin on  First Defense   
 is affected by biological yields from our raw material, which do vary over time. We have contracted with many new farms to
buy more colostrum to increase our production output. Like most U.S. manufacturers, we have been experiencing increases in the
cost of raw materials that we purchase. The costs for production of  First Defense     and  Wipe Out    Dairy
Wipes  have increased due to increased labor costs and other expenses associated with our efforts to sustain compliance with
current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations in our production processes. We have been able to minimize the impact
of these cost increases by implementing yield improvements. Product mix also affects gross margin in that we earn a higher gross
margin on  First Defense     and a much lower gross margin on  Wipe Out    Dairy Wipes.   

Sales
and Marketing Expenses   

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by approximately 27%, or $102,000, to $484,000 during the three-month period ended September
30, 2016, in comparison to $382,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, aggregating 25% and 15% of product
sales, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately 26%, or $278,000, to $1,365,000 during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, in comparison to $1,087,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, aggregating
19% and 14% of product sales, respectively. We continue to leverage the efforts of our small sales force by using veterinary distributors.
These expenses have increased due principally to a strategic decision to invest more to support  First Defense     sales.
This investment may have created, at least in part, our recent increase in product sales. Our current budgetary objective in 2016
is to invest 18% or less of product sales in sales and marketing expenses on an annual basis. We are currently running above that
level as we hold our investment at the planned level, despite the drop in sales, in effort to get sales back on a positive track
after a prolonged period of order backlog.  

Administrative
Expenses   

Administrative
expenses increased by approximately 20%, or $61,000, to $363,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, in comparison
to $302,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. Administrative expenses increased by approximately 14%, or
$134,000, to $1,076,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, in comparison to $941,000 during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2015. We strive to be efficient with these expenses while funding costs associated with complying with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other costs associated with being a publicly-held company. Prior to 2014, we had limited our
investment in investor relations spending. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we initiated an investment in a more actively
managed investor relations program. Additionally, we continue to provide full disclosure of the status of our business and financial
condition in three quarterly reports and one annual report each year, as well as in Current Reports on Form 8-K when legally required
or deemed appropriate by management. Additional information about management and our business is available in our annual Proxy
Statement. All of these reports are filed with the SEC and are available on-line or upon request to the Company.  

Product
Development Expenses   

Product
development expenses increased by 2%, or $6,000, to $308,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$302,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. These expenses aggregated 16% and 12% of product sales during
these three-month periods, respectively. Product development expenses increased by 10%, or $86,000, to $991,000 during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $904,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. These expenses aggregated
14% and 12% of product sales during these nine-month periods, respectively. From January 1, 1999 (the year we first re-focused
our business strategy on  First Defense     and other products for the dairy and beef industries) to September 30, 2016,
we invested the aggregate of approximately $22,975,000 in product development expenses, averaging approximately $1,294,000 per
year during this period. Approximately $4,130,000 of this investment was offset by product licensing revenues, technology sales
and grant income, most of which was earned from 1999 to 2007.  

-  24  - 

ImmuCell Corporation   

The
majority of our product development spending is focused on the development of  Mast Out    , our Nisin-based intramammary
treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. During the 16.75 year period that began on January 1, 2000 (the year
we began the development of  Mast Out    ) and ended on September 30, 2016, we invested the aggregate of approximately
$12,271,000 in the development of  Mast Out    . This estimated allocation to  Mast Out     reflects only
direct expenditures and includes no allocation of product development or administrative overhead expenses. Approximately $2,891,000
of this investment was offset by product licensing revenues and grant income related to  Mast Out    , most of which
was earned from 2001 to 2007.  

During
2000, we acquired an exclusive license from Nutrition 21, Inc. (formerly Applied Microbiology Inc. or AMBI) to develop and market
Nisin-based products for animal health applications, which allowed us to initiate the development of  Mast Out    .
In 2004, we paid Nutrition 21 approximately $965,000 to buy out this royalty and milestone-based license to Nisin, thereby acquiring
control of the animal health applications of Nisin. Nisin, the same active ingredient contained in our topical wipe products,
is an antibacterial peptide known to be effective against most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. In our pivotal effectiveness
study, statistically significant  Mast Out     cure rates were associated with a statistically significant reduction
in milk somatic cell count, which is an important measure of milk quality. Nisin is a well characterized substance, having been
used in food preservation applications for over 50 years. Food-grade Nisin, however, cannot be used in pharmaceutical applications
because of its low purity. Our Nisin technology includes methods to achieve pharmaceutical-grade purity.  

It
is generally current practice to treat mastitis only when the disease has progressed to the clinical stage where the milk from
an infected cow cannot be sold. The use of all mastitis drugs currently on the market is permitted only if the milk from treated
cows is discarded during treatment and for a period of time thereafter to allow the antibiotic residues to clear from milk that
is to be consumed by humans. We have estimated that the cost of this discarded milk may be approximately $300 million per year.
Because milk from cows with subclinical infections can be sold, this disease is largely left untreated to avoid the milk discard
penalty. Subclinical mastitis is associated with reduced milk production (some have estimated approximately 1,500 pounds of lost
milk, or about $240 at $16.00 per hundredweight, per infected cow), reduced milk premiums, reproduction inefficiencies and an
increased incidence of clinical mastitis. We intend to introduce the first mastitis treatment that is not subject to milk discard
or meat withhold requirements, which would be a significant competitive advantage for our product.  

In
2004, we entered into a product development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Animal Health (doing business as Zoetis
since 2013) covering  Mast Out    . Zoetis elected to terminate the agreement in 2007. We believe that this
decision was not based on any unanticipated efficacy or regulatory issues. Rather, we believe the decision was primarily
driven by a marketing concern relating to their fear that the milk from treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of
certain cultured dairy products. Due to the zero milk discard feature, there is a risk that Nisin from the milk of cows
treated with  Mast Out    could interfere with the manufacture of certain (but not all) commercial
cultured dairy products, such as some kinds of cheese and yogurt, if a process tank contains a high enough percentage of milk
from treated cows. The impact of this potential interference ranges from a delay in the manufacturing process, which does
happen at times for other reasons, to the less likely stopping of a cheese starter culture. Milk from cows that have been
treated with  Mast Out     that is sold exclusively for fluid milk products presents no such risk. We
worked with scientists and mastitis experts to conduct a formal risk assessment to quantify the impact that milk from treated
cows may have on cultured dairy products. This study concluded that the dilution of milk from treated cows through comingling
with milk from untreated cows during normal milk hauling and storage practices reduces the risk of interference with
commercial dairy cultures to a negligible level when  Mast Out     is used in accordance with the product
label. We do not believe that a premium-priced product such as  Mast Out    will be used as part of a
whole herd ( blitz ) treatment protocol, which reduces the risk of cheese interference. We do not see this as a
significant problem as modern  precision dairying  practices support reducing the indiscriminate use of drug
treatments.  

Commercial
introduction of  Mast Out     in the United States is subject to approval of our New Animal Drug Application (NADA)
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approval cannot be assured. Foreign regulatory approvals would be required for
sales in key markets outside of the United States, which would involve some similar and some different requirements. The NADA
is comprised of five principal Technical Sections and one administrative submission that are subject to the FDA s phased
review. By statute, each Technical Section submission is generally subject to a six-month review cycle by the FDA. Each Technical
Section can be reviewed and approved separately. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements for a Technical Section
have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these submissions to the
FDA is as follows:  

1)
Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical section Complete Letter
from the FDA.  

2)
Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter
from the FDA.  

3)
Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
The draft product label carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with  Streptococcus agalactiae ,
 Streptococcus dysgalactiae ,  Streptococcus uberis , and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle.

4)
Human Food Safety (HFS): The HFS Technical Section submission was made during the fourth quarter of 2010. This Technical Section
includes several subsections such as: a) toxicology, b) total metabolism, c) effects of drug residues in food on human intestinal
microbiology, d) effects on bacteria of human health concern (antimicrobial resistance) and e) pivotal residue chemistry. During
the second quarter of 2011, we announced that the FDA had accepted the subsections described above and granted  Mast Out    a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment. Before we can obtain this Technical
Section Complete Letter, we must transfer our analytical method that measures Nisin residues in milk to a government laboratory.
Due to unexpected regulatory demands and review delays, completion of the HFS Technical Section is currently anticipated during
the middle of 2017.  

5)
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): Obtaining FDA approval of the CMC Technical Section defines the critical path to
FDA approval and to initial commercial sales. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications
and processing equipment necessary to produce the Drug Substance (the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, which is our pharmaceutical-grade
Nisin) at small-scale. This small-scale facility has been used to i) expand our process knowledge and controls, ii) establish
operating ranges for critical process parameters, iii) optimize process yields and iv) verify the cost of production. We believe
these efforts will reduce risk as we invest in the commercial-scale production facility.  

Accessing
Nisin production at commercial scale is the most critical action in front of us on our path to regulatory approval. Our initial
plan was to have Nisin produced for us under a Development and Manufacturing Agreement with Lonza Sales, Ltd. of Basel, Switzerland,
in order to avoid the investment in a manufacturing facility. By the end of 2011, we determined that the required minimum volumes
were too large to permit efficient, continuous production and that the cost of goods under this contract would not be commercially
feasible. This contract was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2014 by mutual consent. We presented this product development
opportunity to a variety of large and small animal health companies. During the second quarter of 2013, we received a non-refundable
$250,000 exclusive license option fee from a prospective partner that considered manufacturing our Nisin in a plant of their own.
During the third quarter of 2013, this prospective partner decided not to execute a development and marketing license because
it had determined that, in its opinion, it could not cost-effectively commercialize the product. While such a corporate partnership
could have allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, the partnership would have taken
a large share of the gross margin from all future product sales. We are encouraged by the regulatory and marketing feedback from
prospective partners, following their due diligence, that our novel mastitis treatment can achieve FDA approval and have a significant,
positive impact on the dairy industry. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired land nearby to our existing Portland facility
for the construction of our own facility for the commercial-scale production of Nisin. During the third quarter of 2016, we broke
ground for this facility. We plan to complete construction by the third quarter of 2017 and installation and qualification of
equipment by the first quarter of 2018. To gain regulatory approval of this product, validation batches must be produced at commercial
scale, and a detailed CMC Technical Section prepared and submitted to the FDA. We expect that two, six-month reviews of the CMC
Technical Section by the FDA will be required. Additionally, successful FDA site inspections must be achieved.  

After
preparing materials responsive to other administrative requirements, the administrative NADA submission will be assembled for
review by the FDA. This final administrative submission is subject to a statutory sixty-day review period. Adherence to this timeline
sets us up for anticipated regulatory approval in 2019.  

We
are party to a long-term, exclusive supply agreement with Plas-Pak Inc. of Norwich, Connecticut covering the proprietary syringe
that was developed specifically for treating cows with  Mast Out    . These syringes were used for all pivotal studies
of  Mast Out    . During the fourth quarter of 2015, this contract was extended through December 31, 2020.  

Since
2010, we have been party to a long-term, exclusive Contract Manufacture Agreement with Norbrook Laboratories Limited of Newry,
Northern Ireland, an FDA-approved Drug Product (filled and packaged syringes) manufacturer, covering the formulating and sterile-filling
of the Drug Substance into Drug Product for  Mast Out    . Norbrook provided these services for clinical material used
in all pivotal studies of  Mast Out    . During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a revised agreement with
Norbrook covering the final development and commercial-scale (but not at small-scale) launch of  Mast Out     after
FDA approval.  

In
addition to our work on  Mast Out    , we are actively developing further improvements, extensions or additions to our
current  First Defense     product line. For example, we currently are developing treatments that could prevent calf
scours caused by enteric pathogens in addition to  E. coli  K99 and bovine coronavirus (the current disease claims for  First
Defense    ). In connection with that effort, during the second quarter of 2009 we entered into an exclusive license with
the Baylor College of Medicine covering the underlying rotavirus vaccine technology used to generate the specific antibodies.
This perpetual license (if not terminated for cause) is subject to milestone and royalty payments. If approved, this would be
the first passive antibody product on the market with USDA-approved disease claims providing immediate immunity against the three
leading causes of calf scours,  E. coli , coronavirus and rotavirus. Results from pilot studies completed during the first
quarter of 2009 justified continued product development. We initiated a second pivotal effectiveness study at Cornell University
College of Veterinary Medicine during the second quarter of 2014 and announced positive effectiveness results from this pivotal
study during the first quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained concurrence from the USDA that we have been
granted disease claims against bovine rotavirus for our product. We are now working to complete the other laboratory and manufacturing
objectives required for product license approval. This could position us to achieve product licensure and market launch with the
expanded claims during 2017. We intend to continue selling the bivalent formats of  First Defense     as options for customers
after launch of the trivalent product. We are currently working to establish USDA claims for our gel tube formulation of  First
Defense Technology   and to add a  C. perfringens  claim to our product line. At the same time, we are working to
expand our product development pipeline of bacteriocins that can be used as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. During the
second quarter of 2015, we entered into an exclusive option agreement to license new bacteriocin technology from the University
of Massachusetts Amherst. This technology focuses on bacteriocins having activity against Gram-negative infections for use in
combating mastitis in dairy cattle. Subject to the availability of needed financial and other resources, we intend to begin new
development projects that are aligned with our core competencies and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on
suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries.

Other expenses, net, aggregated $81,000 and $27,000 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Income
Before Income Taxes and Net Income    

Our
income before income taxes was $24,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to income before income
taxes of $612,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. We recorded income tax (benefit) expense of (46%) and
43% of the income before income taxes during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income
tax benefit during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 resulted from a lowering of our estimated state tax obligations.
Our net income was $35,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to
net income of $351,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Our
income before income taxes was $690,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to income before income
taxes of $1,634,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. We recorded income tax expense of 31% and 43% of the
income before income taxes during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower tax rate in
2016 is principally related to lower state taxes. Our net income was $478,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $924,000, or $0.29 per diluted share, during the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in earnings per diluted share was the result of a $446,000 drop in net income and there being
more shares outstanding during most of the first nine months of 2016.

may affect the dairy and beef industries and future demand for our products; the cost-effectiveness of additional sales and marketing
expenditures and resources; the accuracy of our understanding of our distributors  ordering patterns; anticipated changes
in our manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies; anticipated competitive and market conditions; and any other statements that
are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  expects ,  may ,
 anticipates ,  aims ,  intends ,  would ,  could ,  should ,
 will ,  plans ,  believes ,  estimates ,  targets ,  projects ,
 forecasts  and similar words and expressions. In addition, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting
us will be those that we anticipate. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those risks
and uncertainties relating to difficulties or delays in development, testing, regulatory approval, production and marketing of
our products, competition within our anticipated product markets, alignment between our manufacturing resources and product demand,
the uncertainties associated with product development and Drug Substance manufacturing, our potential reliance upon third parties
for financial support, products and services, changes in laws and regulations, decision making by regulatory authorities, possible
dilutive impacts on existing stockholders from any equity financing transactions in which we may engage, currency fluctuations
and other risks detailed from time to time in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. Such statements are based on our current
expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including the risk factors summarized below and
uncertainties otherwise referred to in this Quarterly Report.  

Projection
of net income:  Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to
numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of  First Defense   
 or extended shortfalls in production relative to the growing product sales demand could lead to less profits or an operating
loss. Large investments in product development (or cost overruns) can result in a net loss. We expect the recent profitability
trend to continue.

ImmuCell Corporation   

Reliance
on sales of  First Defense    :  We are heavily reliant on the market acceptance of  First Defense     to generate
product sales and fund our operations (including part of the cost of our expansion to support the commercialization of  Mast
Out    ). Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31,
2007, or during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2015 or during the first nine months of 2016 without the gross margin
that we earned on sales of  First Defense    , which accounted for 93% of our product sales during both the first nine
months of 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Product
risks generally:  The sale of our products is subject to financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks.
Elevated standards to achieve regulatory compliance required to sell our products continue to evolve. There is no assurance that
we will continue to achieve market acceptance at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products
at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale.  

Product
liability : The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability
is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are principally directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained
product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We
have no history of claims of this nature being made.  

Regulatory
requirements for  First Defense     :  First Defense     is sold in the United States subject to a product license
from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable
to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the  Reference Standard ). Due to the unique
nature of the  First Defense     label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory
analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability.
However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required
to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product. Similar regulatory oversight risks exist in territories
outside of the United States where we sell our products.  

Regulatory
requirements for  Wipe Out       Dairy Wipes  : While the FDA regulates the manufacture and sale of  Wipe
Out   Dairy Wipes , this type of product is permitted to be sold without a NADA approval, in accordance with the FDA s
Compliance Policy Guide 7125.30 ( Teat Dips and Udder Washes for Dairy Cows and Goats ). This policy guide could be
withdrawn at the FDA s discretion, in which case we would likely discontinue sales of the product. The manufacture of  Wipe
Out   Dairy Wipes  is subject to Part 211 of the cGMP regulations. As a result, our operations are subject to inspection
by the FDA. During the second quarter of 2007, the FDA inspected our facilities and operations and issued a Warning Letter to
us, citing deficiencies in specific areas of the cGMP regulations. We filed an initial response to the FDA during the second quarter
of 2007, and we responded to a request for additional information during the second quarter of 2008. During the first quarter
of 2013, the FDA again inspected our facilities and operations. The report from this inspection was favorable, and we responded
to the few, minor observations that were noted. During the third quarter of 2016, the FDA again inspected our facilities and operations.
The preliminary report from this inspection noted five observations. We submitted our responses to the observations that were
noted, and subsequently were informed that the FDA had closed its inspection. We remain subject to the risk of adverse action
by the FDA in this respect.  

Regulatory
requirements for  Mast Out       : The commercial introduction of  Mast Out     in the United States
will require us to obtain FDA approval for this product. Completing the development of  Mast Out     through to the
submission of the administrative NADA to the FDA involves risk. While three Technical Sections have been approved and the Human
Food Safety Technical Section is near completion, the development process timeline has been extensive (16 years) and has involved
multiple commercial production strategies. As such, the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Technical Section has not yet been
submitted for the Nisin Drug Substance or the Drug Product. To minimize this risk, we have met with the FDA to align on filing
strategy and requirements. It presently is uncertain when or if this approval will be achieved, but we have disclosed a timeline
of events that could lead to approval during 2019. We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors
that we choose to work with to produce  Mast Out    , who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order
to provide us with the products and services we need. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales outside of
the United States, such as Canada. European regulatory authorities are not expected to approve a product with a zero milk discard
claim, which would remove a significant competitive advantage of  Mast Out     in that territory. However, the assigned
milk discard period may be shorter for  Mast Out     than it is for other products on the market in Europe.  

Concentration
of sales:  Approximately 99% and 96% of our product sales were made to customers in the dairy and beef industries throughout
the world during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately 85% and 83% of our product sales were made
to customers in the U.S. dairy and beef industries during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. A large portion
of our product sales (59% and 63% during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively) was made to two large distributors.
A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (56% and 52% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively) was
due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable
with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties
or altering the basis on which they do business with us.

Economics
of the dairy and beef industries :  

The
                                         actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs.
                                         One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents
                                         the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. The annual average for this ratio
                                         of 1.52 in 2012 was the lowest recorded since this ratio was first reported in 1985.
                                         The highest annual average this ratio has reached since 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. Since
                                         this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.0. The annual average of 2.54
                                         for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since it was 2.81 in 2007. This ratio dropped
                                         to an annual average of 2.12 during 2015 and increased slightly to 2.14 during the first
                                         nine months of 2016. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low
                                         values of this ratio recently:    

An
                                         increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. Widespread severe
                                         drought conditions in key U.S. agricultural regions during 2012 drove feed costs higher
                                         and the inventory of all cattle and calves lower. The positive trend in these market
                                         indices during 2013 and 2014 resulted in an increase in the value of milk cows. The 2014
                                         annual average price for a milk cow increased by 32% to $1,835 in comparison to 2013.
                                         Previously, this annual average price since 1970 was only higher when it reached $1,840
                                         in 2007 and $1,953 in 2008. This annual average price for 2015 increased by 9% to $1,993
                                         in comparison to 2014, but this average price has declined by 11% to $1,768 during 2016.
                                         The industry data referred to above is compiled from USDA databases. The value of newborn
                                         bull calves had risen to the unusually high level of approximately $300 to $400, but
                                         this value has decreased recently, currently ranging from $50 to $200 depending on region.
                                         Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions and
                                         the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability
                                         to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. These factors also heighten the challenge
                                         of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as  Mast Out    ) into
                                         the dairy market.

Product
development risks:  The development of new products is subject to financial, scientific, regulatory and market risks. Our current
business growth strategy relies heavily on the development of  Mast Out    , which requires (and will continue to require)
a substantial investment. Our efforts will be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There is no assurance whether or
when we will obtain all of the data necessary to support regulatory approval for this product.  

Risks
associated with  Mast Out     funding strategy:  The construction of and the financing for the commercial-scale Drug
Substance production facility is the most critical action in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval for  Mast Out    .
Proceeds from a bank financing covering a $4.5 million debt facility entered into during the first quarter of 2016 have not yet
been drawn. We believe our current cash and investments, together with the $4.5 million debt facility and cash to be generated
from operations and possibly some incremental bank debt, will be adequate financing to complete the project. However, due to the
risks described herein, we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fully fund that project, and we could experience cost overruns
or delays.  

Uncertainty
of market size and product sales estimates : Estimating the size of the market for  Mast Out     is subject to numerous
uncertainties. Some of the uncertainties surrounding our product include market acceptance, the development of the subclinical
mastitis treatment market, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, cost of manufacture and integration of
milk from treated cows with susceptible cheese starter cultures.  

Competition
from others:  Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are
and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development
capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues
and/or profitability. Zoetis, Elanco, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck, among other companies, sell products that compete
directly with  First Defense     in preventing scours in newborn calves. The product sold by Elanco (which
has a similar selling price to our product) experienced a lack of supply in the market during late 2014 and into the middle
of 2015, but is now back on the market. The product sold by Zoetis does carry a rotavirus claim (which we do not yet have),
but it does not have an  E. coli  claim (which we do have), and it sells for approximately half the price of our
product. The market for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows is highly competitive, and presently is dominated by large
companies such as Zoetis, Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. There is no assurance that  Mast Out     will
compete successfully in this market. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us
in the future.  

Access
to raw materials : Our policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test
our products that we obtain from third parties. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring
essential supplies. The loss of farms from which we buy raw material for  First Defense     could make it difficult for
us to produce enough inventory. We are dependent on our manufacturing facility and operations at 56 Evergreen Drive in Portland
for the production of  First Defense     and our topical wipes and will be dependent on the facility we are constructing
for the production of  Mast Out     when that product begins commercial sales. The specific antibodies that we purify
from colostrum for  First Defense     and the Nisin we produce by fermentation for our topical wipes are not readily
available from other sources. We expect to be dependent on Plas-Pak for the supply of the syringes used for  Mast Out    .
We expect to be dependent on Norbrook for the sterile-filling and final packaging of our Drug Substance into Drug Product. Given
the requirement that such a facility be inspected and approved by the FDA, it could be costly and time-consuming to find an adequate
alternative source for these services. Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at these facilities (including
due to regulatory non-compliance) could adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses
and loss of future sales.  

Small
size; dependence on key personnel:  We are a small company with 46 employees (including 5 part-time employees). As such, we
rely on certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any
of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Our competitive
position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, managerial and sales and marketing personnel,
to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products, maintain compliance with current
products and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price
and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.

Failure
to protect intellectual property:  In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection
for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any
relevant proprietary technology through operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather
than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and
processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology
or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications
and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize
our products or achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents
on terms that are acceptable. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued
to us.  

Certain
provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management:  Provisions
of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent
a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders
might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts
by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:  

limitations
                                         on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and
                                         nominations;    

the
                                         ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;    

the
                                         ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common
                                         Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute
                                         the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that
                                         have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and    

Section
                                         203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware
                                         corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally
                                         defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three
                                         years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date
                                         of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business
                                         combination is approved in a prescribed manner.    

The
existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit
the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential
acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.  

Cost
burdens of our reporting obligations as a public company:  Operating a public company involves substantial costs to comply
with reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  

Exposure
to risks associated with the financial downturn and global economic crisis:  The U.S. economy has technically come out of a
recession, which was caused principally by the housing, credit and financial crises that began around 2008. However, such recent
positive indications could prove temporary and further downturn could occur. The credit markets continue to be very turbulent
and uncertain. Some observers believe that the housing market remains problematic for the overall U.S. economy, the United States
has taken on too much national debt and the equity markets are overvalued. This extraordinary period of instability in the U.S.
economy and the financial markets has been troubling for nearly all Americans. The European economy remains sluggish and precarious.
Certain emerging markets also show signs of slower growth or, in some areas, downturns in economic performance. While we do price
our products in U.S. dollars for all export markets, the strength of the dollar against weakening foreign currencies could reduce
product demand in international markets. A combination of the conditions, trends and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding
negative effect on our business and operations, including the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate
international markets.  

Bovine
diseases : The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis
and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States
have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine.  First Defense   
 is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient, and it is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which
is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect  First
Defense    , although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.  

Biological
terrorism : The threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both the economic health of our customers and our ability to economically
acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms. Any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry
could adversely affect our operations.  

Stock
market valuation:  Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market (NasdaqCM: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume (although
it has increased recently) is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger,
which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. There are companies
in the animal health sector with market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately
$32,000,000 as of September 30, 2016. Some of these companies have little or no product sales. We currently have annual product
sales of over $10,000,000. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily
dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our products under development.

ImmuCell Corporation   

No
expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future:  We do not anticipate paying any dividends
to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development
costs and investments in our facility and production equipment and to reduce debt. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on sales
of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends
in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of
operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and
other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.
