  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of presentation 
  These interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. (the "Company" or the "Registrant") and its subsidiaries (collectively, "OneBeacon") and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Company is an exempted Bermuda limited liability company with U.S.-based underwriting operating companies that are property and casualty insurance writers and a Bermuda-based reinsurance company, Split Rock Insurance, Ltd. ("Split Rock"). OneBeacon offers a wide range of specialty insurance products and services primarily through independent agencies, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and managing general agencies. 
  OneBeacon is   76.1%   owned by White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. ("White Mountains"), a holding company whose businesses provide property and casualty insurance, reinsurance and certain other products. The Company's headquarters are located at 26 Reid Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. The Company's U.S. corporate headquarters are located at 605 North Highway 169, Plymouth, Minnesota 55441 and its registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda.  
  On December 23, 2014, OneBeacon completed the sale of its run-off business to a subsidiary of Armour Group Holdings Limited ( Armour ). See Note 2 "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and Note 15 "Discontinued Operations." The run-off business included the results of OneBeacon's non-specialty commercial lines business as well as the vast majority of asbestos and environmental reserves (the  Runoff Business,  the sale of which is referred to as the  Runoff Transaction ). The Runoff Business has been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   and in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  .  
  OneBeacon's reportable segments are Specialty Products, Specialty Industries and Investing, Financing and Corporate. The Specialty Products segment is comprised of   ten   active underwriting operating segments, representing an aggregation based on those that offer distinct products and tailored coverages and services to a broad customer base across the United States. The Specialty Industries segment is comprised of   six   active underwriting operating segments, representing an aggregation based on those that focus on solving the unique needs of a particular customer or industry group. The Investing, Financing and Corporate segment includes the investing and financing activities for OneBeacon on a consolidated basis, and certain other activities conducted through the Company and its intermediate holding company subsidiaries. 
  All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These interim financial statements include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly state the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of OneBeacon. These interim financial statements may not be indicative of financial results for the full year and should be read in conjunction with the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Refer to the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion regarding OneBeacon s significant accounting policies. Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
  Recently Adopted Changes in Accounting Principles 
  Business Combinations - Measurement Period Adjustments 
  Effective January 1, 2016, OneBeacon adopted ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,   which requires adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in connection with a business combination that are identified during the measurement period to be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, rather than as retroactive adjustments to prior periods. OneBeacon has not recognized any adjustments to estimated purchase accounting amounts for the year to date period ended   September 30, 2016   and accordingly, there was no effect to OneBeacon's financial statements upon adoption.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  NOTE 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Fair Value Measurements 
  Effective January 1, 2016, OneBeacon adopted ASU 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement - Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)   (ASC 820) which eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value hierarchy level for investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value ("NAV") using the practical expedient in ASC 820. OneBeacon measures the fair value of its investments in hedge funds and private equity funds using this practical expedient. Upon adoption, these fair value measurements are no longer classified within the fair value hierarchy. Prior year amounts have been modified to conform to the current year's disclosures.  
  Amendments to Consolidation Analysis 
  On January 1, 2016, OneBeacon adopted ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   (ASC 810) which amends the guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE ). ASU 2015-02 eliminates the separate consolidation guidance for limited partnerships and with it, the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. In addition, ASU 2015-02 changes the guidance for determining if fee arrangements qualify as variable interests and the effect fee arrangements have on the determination of the primary beneficiary. Adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not affect the consolidation analysis for any of OneBeacon's investments. 
  Share-Based Compensation Awards 
  On January 1, 2016, OneBeacon adopted ASU 2014-12,   Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period   (ASC 718)  .   The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that can be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Compensation cost is to be recognized in the period when it becomes probable the performance target will be achieved in an amount equal to the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which service has been rendered. Adoption did not have a significant effect on OneBeacon's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, presentation or disclosures. 
  Debt Issuance Costs 
  Effective January 1, 2016, OneBeacon adopted ASU 2015-03,   Imputation of Interest   (ASC 835) which requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, consistent with the treatment required for debt discounts. The new guidance requires amortization of debt issuance costs to be classified within interest expense and also requires disclosure of the debt's effective interest rate. OneBeacon has applied the guidance retrospectively and as a result has reclassified   $1.9 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets, reflecting these amounts as reduction from the related debt and has modified its disclosures to include the required effective interest rate on its debt. Adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on OneBeacon's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, effective January 1, 2016, OneBeacon adopted ASU 2015-15,   Imputation of Interest   (ASC 835), which addresses the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  Adoption of ASU 2015-15 did not have a significant effect on OneBeacon's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, presentation or disclosures.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  Cash Flow Statement 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (ASC 230). The new guidance addresses the classification and presentation of certain items, including debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investees, for which there was diversity in practice. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. OneBeacon does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  Credit Losses 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   (ASC 326), which establishes new guidance for the recognition of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The new ASU, which applies to financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash, including reinsurance receivables, requires reporting entities to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of a credit exposure using historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial asset. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, including interim periods. OneBeacon is evaluating the expected impact of this new guidance.

Stock Compensation  
  On March 30, 2016, the Board issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASC 718)   which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures by either applying an assumption, as required under existing guidance, or by recognizing forfeitures when they actually occur. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. OneBeacon does not expect a significant effect upon adoption. 
  Leases 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   (ASC 842).  The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for both operating and financing leases, with the exception of leases with an original term of 12 months or less. Under existing guidance recognition of lease assets and liabilities is not required for operating leases. The lease assets and liabilities to be recognized are both measured initially based on the present value of the lease payments. Under the new guidance, a sale-leaseback transaction must meet the recognition criteria under ASC 606,   Revenues   in order to be accounted for as a sale. The new guidance is effective for OneBeacon for years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein.  OneBeacon is evaluating the expected impact of this new guidance and available adoption methods. 
  Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement 
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   (ASC 825-10). The new guidance requires all equity securities with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes therein recognized through current period earnings. In addition, the new ASU simplifies                 the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, and for impaired equity security investments to be measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. OneBeacon has taken the fair      value election for its portfolio of equity security investments and accordingly, does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  Insurance Contracts 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09,   Disclosures about Short Duration Contracts   (ASC 944) which requires expanded footnote disclosures about loss and loss adjustment expense ("LAE") reserves. Under the new guidance, some disclosures currently presented outside of OneBeacon s financial statements, such as loss development tables and a reconciliation of loss development data to the loss and LAE reserves reflected on the balance sheet, will become part of the financial statement footnotes. In addition, the loss development tables required to be presented under the new ASU must be presented on a disaggregated basis by accident year rather than by reporting year as currently presented. Some of the expanded disclosures are new requirements, such as the disclosure of reserves for losses incurred but not reported ("IBNR") plus expected development on reported claims, which must be presented by accident year on a disaggregated basis. The new guidance also requires new disclosures about claim frequency data together with descriptions of the approach used to measure that data. Qualitative descriptions of methodologies and assumptions used to develop IBNR estimates must be presented together with the disaggregated amounts of IBNR to which they relate, along with a discussion of any significant changes in methodology and assumptions and the related effect upon the loss reserves. The new guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with retrospective restatement of prior periods required. OneBeacon will modify its financial statement footnote disclosures to conform to the requirements of ASU 2015-09 upon adoption, including revisions to prior year s disclosures. 
  Revenue Recognition  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (ASC 606)  ,   which modifies the guidance for revenue recognition. The scope of the new ASU excludes insurance contracts but is applicable to certain fee arrangements, such as investment management fees. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (ASC 606), which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  As a result, the standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new guidance and has not yet determined the potential effect of adoption on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

NOTE 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  Crop Business 
  On July 31, 2015, Monsanto Company sold Climate Crop Insurance Agency ("CCIA"), the third party agency with which OneBeacon previously had an exclusive managing general agency agreement, to an affiliate of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ("AmTrust"). As a result of the sale, the Company exited the multiple peril crop insurance ("MPCI") business and its related crop-hail business (collectively, "Crop Business"). As a result of the transaction, OneBeacon and CCIA agreed to an early termination of the existing   five   year agreement. In connection with the termination of the agreement, OneBeacon received a payment of   $3.0 million  . Also related to the transaction, OneBeacon withdrew its 2016 Plan of Operations, which previously authorized it to write MPCI for the 2016 Reinsurance Year, and affiliates of AmTrust agreed to reinsure the Company s remaining net Crop Business exposure for the 2015 Reinsurance Year under a related   100%   quota share reinsurance agreement which, coupled with other transfer and assignment agreements as well as communications with policyholders and agents, had the effect of assumption reinsurance. As a result of this transaction, the Company has   no   material net exposure related to the Crop Business. 
  Runoff Business 
  As described in Note 1 "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," on December 23, 2014, OneBeacon completed the sale of its Runoff Business to Armour. OneBeacon provided financing in the form of surplus notes issued by Bedivere Insurance Company ("Bedivere"), one of the legal entities transferred as part of the transaction, having a par value of   $101.0 million  , which had a fair value of   $64.9 million   on the date of sale. See Note 15 "Discontinued Operations" for further information.  
  Essentia Insurance Company 
  Effective January 1, 2013, OneBeacon completed the sale of Essentia Insurance Company ("Essentia"), which wrote the collector cars and boats business, to Markel Corporation ("Markel"). During the first quarter of 2015, the Company recognized in net other revenues (expenses) a   $3.7 million   negative adjustment to the pre-tax gain on sale of Essentia in connection with an assessment from the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association ("MCCA") payable to Markel Corporation pursuant to the indemnification provisions in the stock purchase agreement governing the sale of Essentia. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized in net other revenues (expenses) a   $0.5 million   positive adjustment to the pre-tax gain on sale of Essentia resulting from recoveries upon the resolution of a matter relating to the MCCA.  
  Except as described above, during   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  , there were no significant acquisitions or dispositions.

NOTE 3. Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE) Reserves 
  Loss and LAE reserve summary 
  The following table summarizes the loss and LAE reserve activities of OneBeacon's insurance subsidiaries for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  : 

Loss and LAE development 
  Loss and LAE development 2016 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , OneBeacon experienced   no   net loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves as modest unfavorable reserve development, primarily in   Ocean Marine   was offset by modest favorable reserve development driven by   Entertainment   and   Accident  .  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , OneBeacon experienced   $15.4 million   net unfavorable loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves. The unfavorable loss and LAE reserve development was primarily driven by   Healthcare   as discussed below, and to a lesser extent, unfavorable development in the Architects and Engineers sub-line within   Other Professional Lines   as well as unfavorable development in   Programs   primarily as a result of two larger auto-related accounts in addition to unfavorable development in several other businesses. This unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable development in   Technology  ,   Accident   and   Financial Services  , as well as a few other businesses.  
  Healthcare Unfavorable Development 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Healthcare   recorded   $31.1 million   of adverse prior accident year development, including   $10.0 million   in the first quarter of 2016 in the complex risk sub-line, which provides professional liability coverage to hospitals, physicians, and physician groups as well as physicians' extended reporting period coverage, and   $20.0 million   in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of increasing claim frequency, as well as higher than expected paid and case activity, most notably within the senior living sub-line, which provides medical malpractice and general liability insurance for extended care facilities, including assisted living, memory care and continuing care facilities. As a result of the continuing loss activity experienced in this sub-line, an in-depth claim file review was performed which confirmed that the increased case incurred activity was driven by frequency, especially in the more recent prior accident years, as opposed to other potential considerations such as changes in claims-handling practices. In addition, a thorough actuarial review was completed, including analysis of the results of enhancements made to the predictive model deployed in the senior living sub-line. Adverse financial results were primarily observed in high-risk categories of business and in difficult geographic venues identified by the predictive model data. As a result of these analyses, management increased its best estimate of prior accident year losses, and increased its loss provisions for the current accident year based on the updated actuarial indications. In addition, also within the   Healthcare   underwriting operating segment, there were two large claims within the managed care errors and omissions sub-line related to unexpected outcomes from mediation and extended costs associated with claim defense, which contributed to the

unfavorable development in prior accident years. There was   $1.1 million   of additional prior accident year reserve development related to   Healthcare   recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to the complex risk sub-line.   
  Loss and LAE development 2015 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , OneBeacon experienced   no   net loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves, as favorable development from several businesses, most notably   Technology  ,   Specialty Property   and   Collector Cars and Boats   was offset by unfavorable development primarily due to an increase in large and small claims in   Entertainment  , and to a lesser extent, unusually heavy activity of both large and small claims in   Ocean Marine,   and also   Programs  .  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , OneBeacon experienced   $1.8 million   of net favorable loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development from   Technology  , and to a lesser extent, from   Specialty Property  ,   Crop  ,   Surety  ,   Collector Cars and Boats   and   Government Risks  . This favorable development was mostly offset by significant unfavorable development due to several large losses and small to mid-sized claims in   Entertainment  , and to a lesser extent, losses in   Inland Marine   business as well as   Tuition Reimbursement   and   Programs  .  
   
  NOTE 4. Reinsurance 
  In the normal course of business, OneBeacon's insurance subsidiaries seek to limit losses that may arise from catastrophes or other events by reinsuring with third-party reinsurers. OneBeacon remains liable for risks reinsured even if the reinsurer does not honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts. 
  Reinsurance Treaties 
  The Company's reinsurance coverage is discussed in Note 4 "Reinsurance" in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes to the Company's reinsurance coverage from that reported in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  The Company entered into a   50%   quota share reinsurance agreement related to its   Financial Institutions   business. 
  Effective May 1, 201  6  , OneBeacon renewed its property catastrophe reinsurance program through April 30, 201  7  . The program provides coverage for OneBeacon's property business as well as certain acts of terrorism. Under the program, the first   $20.0 million   of losses resulting from any single catastrophe are retained, with   100%   of the next   $110.0 million   of losses resulting from the catastrophe being reinsured. Any part of a catastrophe loss in excess of   $130.0 million   would be retained in full. In the event of a catastrophe, OneBeacon's property catastrophe reinsurance program is reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on the percentage of coverage reinstated and the original property catastrophe coverage premium.  
  Reinsurance Recoverables 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , OneBeacon had reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of   $16.4 million   and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses of   $169.4 million  . As reinsurance contracts do not relieve OneBeacon of its obligations, collectability of balances due from reinsurers is critical to OneBeacon's financial strength. The following table summarizes Standard   Poor's Financial Services, LLC ("Standard   Poor's") ratings for OneBeacon's reinsurers, excluding industry pools and associations, based upon reinsurance recoverable amounts on paid and unpaid losses and LAE: 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
   (1)    Standard   Poor's ratings as detailed above are "AA" (Very strong), "A" (Strong) and "BBB" (Adequate). 
   (2)    Includes reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses from Bedivere of   $18.5 million  .

NOTE 5. Investment Securities 
  OneBeacon's invested assets are comprised of securities and other investments held for general investment purposes. Refer to the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion. 
  OneBeacon classifies its portfolio of fixed maturity investments and common equity securities held for general investment purposes as trading securities. Trading securities are reported at fair value as of the balance sheet date as determined by quoted market prices when available. Realized and change in unrealized investment gains on trading securities are reported, on a pre-tax basis, in total revenues as net realized and change in unrealized investment gains. 
  Short-term investments consist of money market funds, certificates of deposit and other securities which, at the time of purchase, mature or become available for use within one year. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. 
  Other investments primarily include surplus notes, private equity funds and hedge funds. OneBeacon measures its investments in private equity funds and hedge funds at fair value with changes therein reported in total revenues as net realized and change in unrealized investment gains. Surplus notes provided in conjunction with the financing of the Runoff Transaction are measured at their estimated fair value based on discounted expected cash flows, with changes in fair value reported in total revenues as net realized and change in unrealized investment gains. Other investments also include an investment in a community reinvestment vehicle which is accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in total revenues as net realized and change in unrealized investment gains, and a tax advantaged federal affordable housing development fund which is accounted for under the proportional amortization method. 
  Prospector Partners, LLC ( Prospector ), was previously the primary manager of OneBeacon's publicly-traded common equity securities portfolio. The Prospector-managed separate accounts were liquidated during the second quarter of 2015, and a Prospector-managed hedge fund was redeemed. As the separate accounts were liquidated, OneBeacon reinvested the majority of the proceeds into exchange traded funds ("ETFs") that seek to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the performance of the S P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 1000 Value indices. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, OneBeacon began investing in high-yield fixed maturity investments. The fair value of high-yield investments held as of September 30, 2016 was   $62.4 million  . The returns for this asset type are classified as fixed maturity investments, although management considers the risk profile to be more similar to common equity securities and other investments. 
  OneBeacon's net investment income is comprised primarily of interest income associated with fixed maturity investments and dividend income from its equity investments.  
  Net investment income for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   consisted of the following: 
   
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
   (1)    Includes an interest payment on the surplus notes of   $2.4 million   received in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held unrestricted collateral from its customers, primarily relating to its surety business, of   $156.2 million   and   $137.7 million  , respectively, which is included in cash and invested assets. The obligation to return these funds is classified as funds held under insurance contracts in the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The following table summarizes the credit ratings   (1)    of the debt securities issued by corporations owned by OneBeacon as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 
   
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
   (1)    Credit ratings are assigned based on the following hierarchy: 1) Standard and Poor s Financial Services LLC ( Standard and Poor s ) and 2) Moody s Investor Service ( Moody s ). 
  Fair value measurements 
  Fair value measurements are categorized into a hierarchy that distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources ("observable inputs") and a reporting entity's internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable ("unobservable inputs"). Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities have the highest priority ("Level 1"), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices, including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities ("Level 2") and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity's estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use, having the lowest priority ("Level 3"). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   91%   and   92%  , respectively, of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon observable inputs. 
    
  Investments valued using Level 1 inputs include fixed maturity investments, primarily investments in U.S. Treasuries, common equity securities and short-term investments, which include U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments valued using Level 2 inputs comprise fixed maturity investments, which have been disaggregated into classes, including debt securities issued by corporations, municipal obligations, mortgage and asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations and preferred stocks. Investments valued using Level 2 inputs also include certain ETFs that track US stock indices such as the S P 500 but are traded on foreign exchanges and that management values using the fund's published NAV to account for the difference in market close times. Fair value estimates for investments that trade infrequently and have few or no observable market prices are classified as Level 3 measurements. Level 3 fair value estimates based upon unobservable inputs include OneBeacon's investments in surplus notes which are measured at their estimated fair value based on discounted expected cash flows using information as of the measurement date, as well as certain investments in fixed maturity investments, common equity securities and other investments, where quoted market prices are unavailable or are not considered reasonable. OneBeacon determines when transfers between levels have occurred as of the beginning of the period.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  NOTE 5. Investment Securities 

OneBeacon uses brokers and outside pricing services to assist in determining fair values. For investments in active markets, OneBeacon uses the quoted market prices provided by outside pricing services to determine fair value. The outside pricing services OneBeacon uses have indicated that they will only provide prices where observable inputs are available. In circumstances where quoted market prices are unavailable or are not considered reasonable, OneBeacon estimates the fair value using industry standard pricing methodologies and observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, credit ratings, prepayment speeds, reference data including research publications and other relevant inputs.  Given that many fixed maturity investments do not trade on a daily basis, the outside pricing services evaluate a wide range of fixed maturity investments by regularly drawing parallels from recent trades and quotes of comparable securities with similar features.  The characteristics used to identify comparable fixed maturity investments vary by asset type and take into account market convention. 
    
  OneBeacon's process to assess the reasonableness of the market prices obtained from the outside pricing sources covers substantially all of its fixed maturity investments and includes, but is not limited to, evaluation of pricing methodologies, review of the pricing services' quality control processes and procedures on at least an annual basis, comparison of market prices to prices obtained from alternate independent pricing vendors on at least a semi-annual basis, monthly analytical reviews of certain prices and review of assumptions utilized by the pricing service for selected measurements on an ad hoc basis throughout the year. OneBeacon also performs back-testing of selected purchases and sales activity to determine whether there are any significant differences between the market price used to value the security prior to purchase or sale and the actual purchase or sale price on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year. Prices provided by the pricing services that vary by more than   5%   and   $1.0 million   from the expected price based on these procedures are considered outliers. Also considered outliers are prices that haven t changed from period to period and prices that have trended unusually compared to market conditions. In circumstances where the results of OneBeacon's review process does not appear to support the market price provided by the pricing services, OneBeacon challenges the price. If OneBeacon cannot gain satisfactory evidence to support the challenged price, it relies upon its own pricing methodologies to estimate the fair value of the security in question. 
    
  The valuation process above is generally applicable to all of OneBeacon s fixed maturity investments. The techniques and inputs specific to asset classes within OneBeacon's fixed maturity investments for Level 2 securities that use observable inputs are as follows: 
  Debt securities issued by corporations:   The fair value of debt securities issued by corporations is determined from an evaluated pricing process that uses information from market sources and integrates relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector news. Key inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including sector, coupon, quality ratings, duration, credit enhancements, early redemption features and market research publications.  
  Municipal obligations:   The fair value of municipal obligations is determined from an evaluated pricing process that uses information from market makers, broker-dealers, buy-side firms, and analysts along with general market information. Key inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer financial statements, material event notices and new issue data, as well as broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including type, coupon, credit quality ratings, duration, credit enhancements, geographic location and market research publications.  
  Mortgage and asset-backed securities:   The fair value of mortgage and asset backed securities is determined from an evaluated pricing process that uses information from market sources and leveraging similar securities. Key inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, underlying tranche cash flow data, collateral performance, plus new issue data, as well as broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including issuer, vintage, loan type, collateral attributes, prepayment speeds, default rates, recovery rates, cash flow stress testing, credit quality ratings and market research publications.  
  Foreign government obligations:   The fair value of foreign government obligations is determined from an evaluated pricing process that uses feeds from data sources in each respective country, including active market makers and inter-dealer brokers. Key inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, local exchange prices, foreign exchange rates and reference data including coupon, credit quality ratings, duration and market research publications.  
  Preferred stocks:   The fair value of preferred stocks is determined from an evaluated pricing process that calculates the appropriate spread over a comparable security for each issue. Key inputs include exchange prices (underlying and common stock of same issuer), benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark

securities, bids, offers, and reference data including sector, coupon, credit quality ratings, duration, credit enhancements, early redemption features and market research publications. 
  Level 3 valuations are generated from techniques that use assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect OneBeacon's assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the investment. Generally, certain securities may start out as Level 3 when they are originally issued but as observable inputs become available in the market, they may be reclassified to Level 2.  
  The fair values of OneBeacon's investments in hedge funds and private equity funds have been classified as net asset value as prescribed by ASU 2015-07. In the event OneBeacon believes that its estimate of net asset value differs from that reported by the fund due to illiquidity or other factors, OneBeacon will adjust reported net asset value to more appropriately represent the fair value of its interest in the investment. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , OneBeacon recorded negative adjustments of   $5.8 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, to the reported net asset value of certain investments in private equity funds. 
  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , other investments reported at fair value represented approximately   5%   of the total investment portfolio and consisted of the following:  

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
              (3)   
    The increase in the fair value of the surplus notes during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven primarily by the narrowing of non-investment grade credit spreads as well as the time value of money benefit generated by moving nine months closer to modeled cash receipts, partially offset by the impact of an interest payment received in the first quarter of 2016.   
               (4)   
    Excludes the carrying value of   $12.8 million   and   $14.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, associated with a tax advantaged federal affordable housing development fund accounted for using the proportional amortization method. 
     The largest investment in a single hedge fund or private equity fund was   $14.2 million   and   $12.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , OneBeacon held   one   private preferred stock that represented approximately   84%   and   85%  , respectively, of its preferred stock portfolio. OneBeacon used quoted market prices for similar securities that were adjusted to reflect management's best estimate of fair value; this security is classified as a Level 3 measurement. 
  Surplus Notes  
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with the Runoff Transaction, OneBeacon provided financing in the form of surplus notes, which had a fair value of   $71.5 million   and   $51.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The surplus notes, issued by one of the transferred entities, Bedivere ( Issuer ), were in the form of both seller priority and pari passu notes.  
  The internal valuation model used to estimate the fair value is based on discounted expected cash flows using information as of the measurement date. The estimated fair value of the surplus notes is sensitive to changes in U.S. treasury rates and public corporate debt credit spreads, as well as changes in estimates with respect to other variables including a discount to reflect the private nature of the notes (and the related lack of liquidity), the credit quality of the notes   based on the financial performance of the Issuer relative to expectations, and the timing, amount, and likelihood of interest and principal payments on the notes, which are subject to regulatory approval and therefore may vary from the contractual terms. An interest payment of   $2.4 million   was received in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company has assumed for estimating value purposes that subsequent interest payouts will begin in year five (2020) and principal repayments begin on a graduating basis in year ten (2025) for the seller priority note and year fifteen (2030) for the pari passu note. Although these variables involve

  NOTE 5. Investment Securities 

considerable judgment, the Company does not currently expect any resulting changes in the estimated value of the surplus notes to be material to its financial position.  
  Below is a table illustrating the valuation adjustments taken to arrive at estimated fair value of the surplus notes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
            (1)   
    Represents the value of the surplus notes, at current market yields on comparable publicly traded debt, and assuming issuer is allowed to make principal and interest payments when its financial capacity is available, as measured by statutory capital in excess of a   250%   score under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' risk-based capital standards for property and casualty companies. 
               (2)   
    Represents anticipated delay in securing regulatory approvals of interest and principal payments to reflect graduated changes in Issuer's statutory surplus. The monetary impact of the anticipated delay is measured based on credit spreads of publicly traded debt with roughly equivalent percentages of discounted payments missed. 
               (3)   
    Represents impact of liquidity spread to account for OneBeacon's sole ownership of the notes, lack of a trading market, and ongoing regulatory approval risk. 
               (4)   
    The increase in the fair value of the surplus notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven primarily by the narrowing of non-investment grade credit spreads as well as the time value of money benefit generated by moving nine months closer to modeled cash receipts, partially offset by the impact of an interest payment received in the first quarter of 2016.   
     Fair value measurements by level 
  The following tables summarize the Company's fair value measurements for investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by level. The major security types were based on the legal form of the securities. OneBeacon has disaggregated its fixed maturity investments based on the issuing entity type, which impacts credit quality, with debt securities issued by U.S. government entities carrying minimal credit risk, while the credit and other risks associated with other issuers, such as corporations, foreign governments, municipalities or entities issuing asset-backed securities vary depending on the nature of the issuing entity type. OneBeacon further disaggregates debt securities issued by corporations and common equity securities by industry sector because investors often reference commonly used benchmarks and their subsectors to monitor risk and performance. Accordingly, OneBeacon has further disaggregated these asset classes into subclasses based on the similar sectors and industry classifications the Company uses to evaluate investment risk and performance against commonly used benchmarks, such as the Barclays U.S. Intermediate Aggregate and S P 500 indices.

The corresponding credit spread was increased by an additional   250   bps to reflect both a liquidity discount for a private debt instrument and regulatory payment approval uncertainty, which was added to the treasury rate to determine the discount rate for the seller priority note. 
               (4)   
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company assumed for the purpose of estimating the fair value that future interest payouts begin in year five (2020) and principal repayments begin on a graduated basis in year ten (2025) for the seller priority note and year fifteen (2030) for the pari passu note. 
               (5)   
    Stochastic modeling supporting the fair value estimation indicates that the average percentage of discounted payments missed on the pari passu note is roughly equivalent to that of a conventional debt security with a credit rating of  CCC . The corresponding credit spread was increased by an additional   250   bps to reflect both a liquidity discount for a private debt instrument and regulatory payment approval uncertainty, which was added to the treasury rate to determine the discount rate for the pari passu note.

Mortgage and Asset-backed Securities 
  OneBeacon purchases commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") to maximize its risk adjusted returns in the context of a diversified portfolio. OneBeacon's non-agency CMBS are generally short tenor and structurally senior, with approximately   30   points of subordination on average for fixed rate and floating rate CMBS as of   September 30, 2016  . In general, subordination represents the percentage of principal loss on the underlying collateral that would have to occur before the security incurs a loss. These collateral losses, instead, are first absorbed by other securities lower in the capital structure. OneBeacon believes this structural protection mitigates the risk of loss tied to refinancing challenges facing the commercial real estate market. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   none   of the underlying loans of the agency and non-agency CMBS were reported as non-performing. OneBeacon did not hold any RMBS categorized as sub-prime as of   September 30, 2016  . OneBeacon considers sub-prime mortgage-backed securities to be those that have underlying loan pools that exhibit weak credit characteristics or are issued from dedicated sub-prime shelves or dedicated second-lien shelf registrations (i.e., OneBeacon considers investments backed primarily by second-liens to be sub-prime risks regardless of credit scores or other metrics). 
  There are also mortgage-backed securities that OneBeacon categorizes as "non-prime" (also called "Alt A" or "A-") that are backed by collateral that has overall credit quality between prime and sub-prime, as determined based on OneBeacon's review of the characteristics of their underlying mortgage loan pools, such as credit scores and financial ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , OneBeacon did not hold any mortgage-backed securities classified as non-prime. OneBeacon's non-agency RMBS portfolio is generally of moderate average life, fixed rate and structurally senior. OneBeacon does not own any collateralized debt obligations, with the exception of   $27.0 million   of non-agency RMBS resecuritization tranches, each a senior tranche in its own right and each collateralized by a single earlier vintage Super Senior or Senior non-agency RMBS. 
  The following table summarizes the carrying value of OneBeacon's mortgage and asset-backed securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Other Investments 
  OneBeacon holds investments in hedge funds and private equity funds which are included in other investments. The fair value of these investments has generally been estimated using the net asset value of the funds. The following table summarizes investments in hedge funds and private equity funds as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Redemptions of investments in certain hedge funds are subject to restrictions including "lock-up" periods where no redemptions or withdrawals are allowed, restrictions on redemption frequency and advance notice periods for redemptions. Amounts requested for redemptions remain subject to market fluctuations until the redemption effective date, which generally falls at the end of the defined redemption period. The following summarizes the   September 30, 2016   fair value of hedge funds subject to restrictions on redemption frequency and advance notice period requirements for investments in active hedge funds: 

Certain hedge fund investments are no longer active and are in the process of disposing of their underlying investments. Distributions from such funds are remitted to investors as the fund's underlying investments are liquidated. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of OneBeacon's hedge funds in liquidation was   $1.0 million  . The actual amount of the final distribution is subject to market fluctuations. The date at which such distributions will be received is not determinable as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  OneBeacon has also submitted redemption requests for certain of its investments in active hedge funds. As of   September 30, 2016  , redemptions of   $2.4 million   were outstanding and remain subject to market fluctuations. The date at which such redemptions will be received is not determinable at   September 30, 2016  . Redemptions are recorded as receivables when the investment is no longer subject to market fluctuations.

Investments in private equity funds are generally subject to lock-up periods during which investors may not request a redemption. Distributions prior to the expected termination date of the fund may be limited to dividends or proceeds arising from the liquidation of the fund's underlying investment. In addition, certain private equity funds provide an option to extend the lock-up period at either the sole discretion of the fund manager or upon agreement between the fund and the investors. As of   September 30, 2016  , investments in private equity funds were subject to lock-up periods as follows: 

NOTE 6. Debt 
  OneBeacon's debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 
   
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
   (1)    Unamortized issuance costs have been reclassified from other assets to a decrease of the debt liability in accordance with ASU 2015-03, as described in Note 1 "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 
  2012 Senior Notes 
  In November 2012, OneBeacon U.S. Holdings, Inc. ("OBH") issued   $275.0 million   face value of senior unsecured notes ("2012 Senior Notes") through a public offering, at an issue price of   99.9%   and received   $272.9 million   of proceeds. The 2012 Senior Notes bear an annual interest rate of   4.6%   payable semi-annually in arrears on May 9 and November 9, until maturity on November 9, 2022, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the Company. Taking into effect the amortization of the original issue discount and all underwriting and issuance expenses, the 2012 Senior Notes have an effective yield to maturity of approximately   4.7%   per annum.  
  Credit Facility  
  On September 29, 2015, the Company and OBH, as co-borrowers and co-guarantors, entered into a revolving credit facility administered by U.S. Bank N.A. and also including BMO Harris Bank N.A., which has a total commitment of   $65.0 million   and has a maturity date of September 29, 2019 (the "Credit Facility").  As of September 30, 2016, the Credit Facility was undrawn. 
  Debt Covenants 
  The 2012 Senior Notes were issued under indentures that contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, OBH, and their respective subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and limits the ability of the Company and OBH to consolidate, merge or transfer its properties and assets. The indentures do not contain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which the Company or OBH must adhere. In addition, a failure by the Company or OBH or their respective subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on covered debt, where such failure results in the acceleration of at least   $75.0 million   of the principal amount of covered debt, could trigger the acceleration of the 2012 Senior Notes.  
  The Credit Facility contains various affirmative, negative and financial covenants which OneBeacon considers to be customary for such borrowings, including certain minimum net worth and maximum debt to capitalization standards. These covenants can restrict the Company, OBH and their respective subsidiaries in several ways, including their ability to incur additional indebtedness. An uncured breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Facility, which would allow lenders to declare any amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , OneBeacon was in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2012 Senior Notes and the Credit Facility.

NOTE 7. Segment Information 
  As discussed in Note 12 "Segment Information" in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has   sixteen   active underwriting operating segments, which are managed by the chief operating decision maker and are aggregated into   two   underwriting reportable segments, Specialty Products and Specialty Industries. In addition, the Investing, Financing and Corporate reportable segment includes the investing and financing activities for OneBeacon on a consolidated basis, and certain other activities conducted through the Company and its intermediate holding company subsidiaries.  
  Invested assets are not allocated to the Specialty Products and Specialty Industries segments since OneBeacon does not manage them by segment. Invested assets, net investment income and net realized and change in unrealized investment gains related to OneBeacon's Specialty Products and Specialty Industries segments are included in the Investing, Financing and Corporate segment since these assets are available for payment of losses and expenses for all segments. Debt and the related interest expense on debt also are not allocated to or managed by segment and are also included in the Investing, Financing and Corporate segment. 
  Substantially all of the Company's revenue is generated from customers located in the United States.  
  There have been no material changes to the Company's determination of reportable segments from that reported in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NOTE 8. Retirement Plan 
  OneBeacon previously sponsored the OneBeacon qualified pension plan (the "Qualified Plan"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Qualified Plan finalized its termination by purchasing group annuity contracts from the Principal Financial Group ("Principal"), and making lump sum distributions to Qualified Plan participants electing such payments, which eliminated the remaining Qualified Plan liability, and also ceased administratively paying claims. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax pension settlement gain of   $3.0 million  , inclusive of a   $3.2 million   (pre-tax) gain representing a pension settlement adjustment recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016, resulting from a refund from Principal related to the final settlement of the Qualified Plan, and no longer has a projected benefit obligation with respect to the Qualified Plan. The Company transferred   $47.1 million   of excess invested assets from the Qualified Plan into the trust supporting the OneBeacon 401(k) Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("KSOP"), which is the Qualified Replacement Plan ("QRP"), during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (see Note 9 "Employee Share-Based Compensation"), with   $12.6 million   of excess invested assets remaining in the Qualified Plan trust as of September 30, 2016 in order to wind-down potential post-termination obligations of that plan, as approved by way of a March 2016 private letter ruling from the IRS. The invested assets related to both the legacy Qualified Plan and the QRP are included in other assets and are accounted for at fair value with related income recognized in net other revenues (expenses).  
  OneBeacon continues to sponsor a non-qualified, non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan ("Non-qualified Plan") covering certain employees who were employed as of December 31, 2001 and former employees who had met the eligibility requirements, as well as retirees. The Non-qualified Plan, was frozen and curtailed in 2002, resulting in the pension benefit obligation being equal to the accumulated benefit obligation. The benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees  compensation through December 31, 2002. OneBeacon s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts to satisfy actual disbursements for the calendar year. 
  The components of net periodic benefit cost for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   for the Non-qualified Plan and Qualified Plan were as follows:   

  _______________________________________________________________________________ 
   (1)    Represents the impact of the termination of the Qualified Plan during   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016  . 
  OneBeacon anticipates contributing   $2.1 million   to the Non-qualified Plan in 2016, for which OneBeacon has assets held in a rabbi trust. During   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016  , the Company contributed   $0.6 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, to the Non-qualified Plan. 
  OneBeacon also had a post-employment benefit liability related to death benefits to beneficiaries of former executives that are no longer employed by the Company of   $12.4 million   and   $12.5 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. OneBeacon has set aside funds to satisfy its obligation in a rabbi trust of   $29.4 million   and   $33.9 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company transferred   $5.5 million   out of the rabbi trust into OneBeacon corporate assets in response to the overfunding of the Rabbi Trust and which was allowed under the trust agreement and supported by multiple external actuarial valuations.   
   
  NOTE 9. Employee Share-Based Incentive Compensation Plans 
  OneBeacon's share-based compensation plans include performance shares, restricted shares and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), which are designed to maximize shareholder value over long periods of time by aligning the financial interests of its management with those of its owners. Performance shares are payable only upon achievement of pre-defined business goals and are valued based on the market value of OneBeacon's common shares at the time awards are earned. Performance shares

and restricted stock units are typically paid in cash, though, in some instances, they may be paid in common shares or may be deferred in accordance with the terms of OneBeacon's deferred compensation plan. Restricted shares vest either annually in equal installments over the specified service period or cliff-vest in full after the   2   to   3  -year service period, depending on the award. OneBeacon expenses the full cost of all its share-based compensation over the requisite service period. The Company recognized expense related to its share-based compensation plans, including the KSOP plan, of   $2.7 million   and   $1.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7.9 million   and   $6.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The following summarizes performance shares outstanding and accrued performance share expense at   September 30, 2016   for each performance cycle: 

All performance shares cliff vest on December 31 of the last year in the cycle. If   100%   of the outstanding performance shares had been vested on   September 30, 2016  , the total additional compensation cost to be recognized would have been   $2.3 million  , based on current accrual factors (common share price, accumulated dividends and payout assumptions) at   September 30, 2016  . 
  All performance shares earned and paid were settled in cash or by deferral into OneBeacon's deferred compensation plan. 
  Restricted Shares 
  On February 24, 2016, OneBeacon issued to certain employees   170,650   shares of restricted stock having a grant date fair value of   $2.3 million  , of which   92,500   are scheduled to cliff vest in full on   February 24, 2018   and the remaining   78,150   are scheduled to cliff vest in full on   January 1, 2019  .  
  On February 24, 2015, OneBeacon issued to certain employees   75,950   shares of restricted stock having a grant date fair value of   $1.1 million  , which are scheduled to cliff vest in full on January 1, 2018.  
  On May 25, 2011, OneBeacon issued to its CEO   630,000   shares of restricted stock, of which   157,500   restricted shares vested on each of February 22, 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the remaining   157,500   restricted shares are scheduled to vest on February 22, 2017.  
  The restricted shares contain dividend participation features and therefore are considered participating securities.

  Restricted Stock Units 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   233,461   RSUs were issued, of which   219,112   were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The RSUs are scheduled to cliff vest in full on December 31, 2018, at which time the RSUs will be paid out in cash or shares at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   215,698   RSUs were issued, of which   177,409   were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  The expense associated with the RSUs, which is being recognized over the vesting period, was   $0.5 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.4 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Share-Based Compensation under Qualified Retirement Plans 
  OneBeacon sponsors a defined contribution plan, the KSOP which includes an employee stock ownership component. OneBeacon has recorded   $1.2 million   and   $1.4 million   in compensation expense to pay benefits and allocate common shares to participants' accounts for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3.9 million   and   $4.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. As discussed in Note 8 "Retirement Plans,"   $47.1 million   was transferred to the KSOP plan trust during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and will be used to fund future contributions.   
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the KSOP owned less than   3%   of either of the total White Mountains common shares outstanding or the total Company common shares outstanding. All common shares held by the KSOP are considered outstanding for earnings per share computations.

NOTE 10. Income Taxes 
  OneBeacon and its Bermuda-domiciled subsidiaries are not subject to Bermuda income tax under current Bermuda law. In the event that there is a change in the current law such that taxes are imposed, OneBeacon and its Bermuda-domiciled subsidiaries would be exempt from such tax until March 31, 2035, pursuant to the Bermuda Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966. OneBeacon also has subsidiaries that operate in Gibraltar, Barbados, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the United States. U.S. operations are financed with a combination of debt and equity and the financing income and underwriting income currently account for the majority of non-U.S. earnings. 
  OneBeacon's income tax expense related to pre-tax income from continuing operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   represented a net effective tax rate of   14.0%   and a net effective tax benefit of   20.8%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  OneBeacon's income tax expense related to pre-tax income from continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   represented a net effective tax benefit of   6.5%   and   7.0%  , respectively.  The effective tax rates for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  , were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of   35%   due to income generated in jurisdictions other than the United States, principally representing interest income and underwriting income taxed in a jurisdiction with a lower effective tax rate.  
  The rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was impacted by a   $3.5 million   favorable settlement of the 2010-2012 IRS exam and by a   $12.8 million   favorable settlement of the 2007-2009 IRS exam, as further described below. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rate on non-U.S. income was   0.4%   and   2.9%  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   the effective tax rate on non-U.S. income was   0.6%   and   1.7%  , respectively 
  In arriving at the effective tax rate for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  , OneBeacon forecasted all income and expense items including the realized and change in unrealized investment gains for the years ending December 31,   2016   and   2015  , and included these gains in the effective tax rate calculation.  
  OneBeacon records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it becomes more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in income tax expense in the period of change.  In determining whether or not a valuation allowance, or change therein, is warranted, OneBeacon considers factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods as well as prudent and economically feasible strategies that, if executed would result in the realization of a deferred tax asset.  It is possible that certain planning strategies or projected earnings in certain subsidiaries may not be feasible to utilize the entire deferred tax asset, which could result in material changes to OneBeacon s deferred tax assets and tax expense. 
  OneBeacon classifies all interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. With few exceptions, OneBeacon is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013.  
  On January 19, 2016, OneBeacon received a Form 870-AD (Offer to Waive Restrictions on Assessment and Collection Tax Deficiency and to Accept Overassessment) from the IRS Appeals Office relating to the examination of tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009. All disputed items have now been agreed to and resolved with the Joint Committee on Taxation. As the receipt of the Form 870-AD described above represents formal settlement, OneBeacon recorded a tax benefit of   $12.8 million   in the first quarter of 2016 related to tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009. 
  On May 27, 2016, OneBeacon received the Closing Letter (Letter 1156) from the IRS Revenue Agents relating to the examination of tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012. All disputed items have now been agreed to and resolved. As the receipt of the Closing Letter described above represents formal settlement, OneBeacon recorded a tax benefit of   $3.5 million   in the second quarter of 2016 related to tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012. 
   
  NOTE 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  OneBeacon carries its financial instruments on its balance sheet at fair value with the exception of its investment in qualified affordable housing projects, which is accounted for using the proportional amortization method, and fixed-rate, long-term indebtedness. For certain financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, other independent valuation techniques and assumptions are used. Because considerable judgment is used, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. Certain financial instruments are excluded from disclosure, including insurance contracts.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of OneBeacon's 2012 Senior Notes (its fixed-rate, long-term indebtedness) was   $277.8 million   and   $276.4 million  , respectively.  As described in Note 6 "Debt", the net carrying

  NOTE 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

value of the 2012 Senior Notes was   $273.1 million   and   $272.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value measurement of the 2012 Senior Notes is classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy and determined based on the closing market price at the end of the fiscal quarter.  
   
  NOTE 12. Legal Contingencies 
  OneBeacon, and the insurance and reinsurance industry in general, is routinely subject to claims related litigation and arbitration in the normal course of business, as well as litigation and arbitration that does not arise from, or directly relate to, claims activity. OneBeacon's estimates of the costs of settling matters routinely encountered in claims activity are reflected in the reserves for unpaid loss and LAE. See Note 3 "Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense ("LAE") Reserves." 
  OneBeacon evaluates its exposure to non-claims related litigation and arbitration and establishes accruals for litigation and arbitration if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and it can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of litigation and arbitration is made if it is probable that a loss has been incurred or if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. Although the ultimate outcome of claims and non-claims related litigation and arbitration, and the amount or range of potential loss at any particular time, is often inherently uncertain, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of such claims and non-claims related litigation and arbitration will have a material adverse effect on OneBeacon's financial position, full year results of operations, or cash flows. 
  The following summarizes significant ongoing non-claims related litigation or arbitration as of   September 30, 2016  : 
  Deutsche Bank Litigation 
  In June 2011, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Law Debenture Company of New York and Wilmington Trust Company (collectively referred to as  Plaintiffs ), in their capacity as trustees for certain senior notes issued by the Tribune Company ( Tribune ), filed lawsuits in various jurisdictions (the  Noteholder Actions ) against numerous defendants including OneBeacon, OneBeacon-sponsored benefit plans and other affiliates of White Mountains in their capacity as former shareholders of Tribune seeking recovery of the proceeds from the sale of common stock of Tribune in connection with Tribune's leveraged buyout in 2007 (the  LBO ). Tribune filed for bankruptcy in 2008 in the Delaware bankruptcy court (the  Bankruptcy Court ). The Bankruptcy Court granted Plaintiffs permission to commence these LBO-related actions, and in 2011, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted a motion to consolidate the actions for pretrial matters and transferred all such proceedings to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs seek recovery of the proceeds received by the former Tribune shareholders on a theory of constructive fraudulent transfer asserting that Tribune purchased or repurchased its common shares without receiving fair consideration at a time when it was, or as a result of the purchases of shares, was rendered, insolvent. OneBeacon has entered into a joint defense agreement with other affiliates of White Mountains that are defendants in the action. OneBeacon and OneBeacon-sponsored benefit plans received approximately   $32 million   for Tribune common stock tendered in connection with the LBO. The Court granted an omnibus motion to dismiss the Noteholders Action in September 2013 and plaintiffs appealed. On March 29, 2016, a three judge panel of the U.S Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the Noteholders Action. On July 22, 2016, the Plaintiff's petition to the Second Circuit for reconsideration or for a rehearing en banc was denied in full. On September 9, 2016 the Plaintiffs filed for a writ of certiorari, seeking review in the United States Supreme Court.  
   In addition, OneBeacon, OneBeacon-sponsored benefit plans and other affiliates of White Mountains in their capacity as former shareholders of Tribune, along with thousands of former Tribune shareholders, have been named as defendants in an adversary proceeding brought by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of the Tribune Company (the  Committee ), on behalf of the Tribune Company, which seeks to avoid the repurchase of shares by Tribune in the LBO on a theory of intentional fraudulent transfer (the  Committee Action ). Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in 2012, and a litigation trustee replaced the Committee as plaintiff in the Committee Action. This matter was consolidated for pretrial matters with the Noteholder Actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and was stayed pending the motion to dismiss in the Noteholder Action. An omnibus motion to dismiss the shareholder defendants in the Committee Action was filed in May 2014.   No   amount has been accrued in connection with this matter as of   September 30, 2016  , as the amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

NOTE 14. Common Shareholders' Equity 
  Common Shares Repurchased and Retired 
  On August 22, 2007, the Company's Board authorized the repurchase of up to   $200.0 million   of its Class A common shares from time to time, subject to market conditions. Shares may be repurchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have a stated expiration date. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   850,349   shares were repurchased under the share repurchase authorization for   $10.6 million   at an average share price of   $12.42  .   No   shares were repurchased under the share repurchase authorization during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The amount of authorization remaining is   $75.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company repurchased   64,981   and   112,051   common shares, respectively, for   $0.9 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to satisfy employee income tax withholding, pursuant to employee benefit plans. Shares repurchased pursuant to employee benefit plans do not reduce the board authorization referred to above. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   no   restricted shares were forfeited, with   1,500   such forfeitures occurring during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  Dividends on Common Shares 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   the Company declared and paid cash dividends to OneBeacon shareholders of   $0.63   per common share for a total of   $59.4 million   and   $60.0 million  , respectively. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The pre-tax components of the Company's other comprehensive income and the related tax expense are as follows: 

NOTE 15. Discontinued Operations 
  Runoff Business 
  As described in Note 1 "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 2 "Acquisitions and Dispositions," on December 23, 2014, OneBeacon completed the sale of its Runoff Business to Armour.  
  In conjunction with the Runoff Transaction, OneBeacon provided financing in the form of surplus notes issued by Bedivere having a par value of   $101.0 million  , which had a fair value of   $64.9 million   on the date of sale. Subsequent to the date of sale, these notes have been included in other investments on OneBeacon's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 5 "Investment Securities" for further disclosures regarding these surplus notes. 
  The vast majority of the gross and net Runoff Business unpaid loss and LAE reserves were included in the entities that were transferred to Armour. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , gross loss and LAE reserves of   $18.5 million   and   $20.4 million  , respectively, related to the Runoff Business were ceded to Bedivere, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Armour, by way of a   100%   quota share agreement with ASIC. 
  Summary of Results of Operations 
  There was   no   gain or loss related to discontinued operations for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million   for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015  , respectively, was the result of post-closing expenses incurred in connection with the Runoff Business.  
  The gain from sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   represents a positive adjustment to the estimated loss on sale taking into consideration the final settlement of certain post-closing items.

ITEM 2.   
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
               The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements." Statements that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements. OneBeacon cannot promise that its expectations in such forward-looking statements will turn out to be correct. OneBeacon's actual results could be materially different from and worse than its expectations. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 65 for specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. 
   
  Overview   Three months ended September 30, 2016   versus   three months ended September 30, 2015 
  We ended the   third quarter   of   2016   with a book value per share of   $10.93  , reflecting a   2.9%   increase, including a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Net income attributable to OneBeacon's common shareholders was   $28.3 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to a net loss of   $13.4 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  . Pre-tax underwriting income of   $10.6 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , reflecting a combined ratio of   96.2%  , compared to pre-tax underwriting income of   $3.7 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  , reflecting a combined ratio of   98.8%  . The pre-tax underwriting results for the   third quarter   of   2016   were driven by the strong performance of a number of our businesses including the improved performance of   Entertainment   which was negatively impacted by an increase in large and small claims in the   third quarter   of   2015  . Pre-tax net investment return was   $27.3 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , representing a   1.1%   total return on average invested assets, compared to negative   $17.5 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing a negative   0.6%   total return on average invested assets. The significant increase was driven by a higher return from our common equity securities portfolio due to improved market conditions and a higher return from our other investments portfolio due to a favorable impact from the surplus notes driven by changes in credit spreads.  
  On July 31, 2015, Monsanto Company sold Climate Crop Insurance Agency (CCIA), the third party agency with which OneBeacon previously had an exclusive managing general agency agreement, to an affiliate of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AmTrust). As a result of the sale, the Company exited the multiple peril crop insurance (MPCI) business and its related crop-hail business (collectively, Crop Business). As a result of the transaction, OneBeacon and CCIA agreed to an early termination of the existing   five   year agreement. In connection with the termination of the agreement, OneBeacon received a payment of   $3.0 million   (Crop Transaction Fee). Also related to the transaction, OneBeacon withdrew its 2016 Plan of Operations, which previously authorized it to write MPCI for the 2016 Reinsurance Year, and affiliates of AmTrust agreed to reinsure the Company s remaining net Crop Business exposure for the 2015 Reinsurance Year under a related   100%   quota share reinsurance agreement which, coupled with other transfer and assignment agreements as well as communications with policyholders and agents, had the effect of assumption reinsurance. As a result of this transaction, the Company has   no   material net exposure related to the Crop Business. During the   third quarter   of   2015  , the Company recorded ceded written premiums of   $35.9 million  , ceded earned premiums of   $16.8 million  , ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses of   $15.1 million  , and ceded insurance acquisition expenses of   $2.8 million   as a result of this transaction.  
  During the   third quarter   of   2016  , we recognized a   $0.5 million   positive adjustment to the pre-tax gain on sale of Essentia Insurance Company (Essentia) related to recoveries upon the resolution of a matter relating to the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA).   
  Overview   Nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  We ended   the first nine months of   2016   with a book value per share of   $10.93  , reflecting a   10.0%   increase on an internal rate of return basis, including a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Net income attributable to OneBeacon's common shareholders was   $99.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to net income of   $14.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Pre-tax underwriting income was   $16.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting a combined ratio of   98.0%  , compared to pre-tax underwriting income of   $33.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , reflecting a combined ratio of   96.3%  . Pre-tax underwriting results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were adversely impacted by the unfavorable performance of our   Healthcare   business, discussed below, and to a lesser extent, from our   Programs   business. This unfavorable performance partially offset the strong underwriting results from most of our other businesses, most notably   Accident  , and also significant improvement in   Entertainment   and, to a lesser extent,   Ocean Marine   and lower underwriting losses in   Inland Marine  , all of which were negatively impacted by elevated loss activity in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Pre-tax net investment return was   $95.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing a   3.8%   total return on average invested assets, compared to   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , representing a   0.3%   total return on average invested assets. The significant increase was driven by a higher return from our common equity securities portfolio due to improved market conditions, a higher return from our other investments portfolio due to a favorable impact from the surplus notes driven by changes in credit spreads, and a higher return from our fixed maturity investments portfolio

due to interest rate movements for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Healthcare   recorded   $31.1 million   of adverse prior accident year development, including   $10.0 million   in the first quarter of 2016 in the complex risk sub-line, which provides professional liability coverage to hospitals, physicians, and physician groups as well as physicians' extended reporting period coverage and   $20.0 million   in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of increasing claim frequency, as well as higher than expected paid and case activity, most notably within the senior living sub-line, which provides medical malpractice and general liability insurance for extended care facilities, including assisted living, memory care and continuing care facilities. As a result of the continuing loss activity experienced in this sub-line, an in-depth claim file review was performed which confirmed that the increased case incurred activity was driven by frequency, especially in the more recent prior accident years, as opposed to other potential considerations such as changes in claims-handling practices. In addition, a thorough actuarial review was completed, including analysis of the results of enhancements made to the predictive model deployed in the senior living sub-line. Adverse financial results were primarily observed in high-risk categories of business and in difficult geographic venues identified by the predictive model data. As a result of these analyses, management increased its best estimate of prior accident year losses, and increased its loss provisions for the current accident year based on the updated actuarial indications. In addition, also within the   Healthcare   underwriting operating segment, there were two large claims within the managed care errors and omissions sub-line related to unexpected outcomes from mediation and extended costs associated with claim defense, which contributed to the unfavorable development in prior accident years. There was   $1.1 million   of additional prior accident year reserve development related to   Healthcare   recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to the complex risk sub-line.   
  As a result of this loss activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we have taken corrective underwriting actions to focus on more desirable risks. As a result primarily of these actions,   Healthcare   premiums have decreased by   $16.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In addition,   Programs   net written premiums decreased by   $19.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as a result of exiting two larger   Programs   accounts. 
  Our net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included a   $16.3 million   tax benefit resulting from the settlement of IRS examinations for tax years 2007 through 2012.  Our net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was adversely impacted by a   $3.7 million   negative adjustment to the pre-tax gain on the sale of Essentia in connection with an assessment from the MCCA payable to Markel pursuant to the indemnification provisions in the stock purchase agreement governing the sale of Essentia. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a   $0.5 million   positive adjustment to the pre-tax gain on sale of Essentia related to recoveries upon the resolution of a matter relating to the MCCA.

Consolidated Results   Three months ended September 30, 2016   versus   three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Our comprehensive income attributable to OneBeacon's common shareholders was   $28.6 million   for   the third quarter of   2016   compared to a loss of   $13.2 million   for   the third quarter of   2015  , with the change driven primarily by a   $44.8 million   improvement in pre-tax investment results due to higher net realized and change in unrealized gains in our common equity securities and other investment portfolios driven by the factors discussed below in "Summary of Investment Results."  Pre-tax underwriting results also increased by   $6.9 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   driven by the strong performance of a number of our businesses including the improved performance of   Entertainment   which was negatively impacted by an increase in large and small claims in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  
  Our total revenues of   $307.0 million   for   the third quarter of   2016   increased   $39.2 million   from   $267.8 million   for the   2015   period, due to the   $44.8 million   increase in pre-tax investment results and was partially offset by a decrease in net earned premiums of   $3.5 million  , or   1.2%  , resulting from premium decreases in many of our businesses, primarily in   Entertainment   and   Healthcare,   which were partially offset by the prior period impact of ceded earned premiums of   $16.8 million   from the exit of   Crop   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .

Written Premiums 
  Consolidated net written premiums were   $324.1 million   in   the third quarter of   2016  , with the increase of   10.7%   from the comparative prior year period driven by the impact of ceded written premiums of   $35.9 million   from the exit of   Crop   in the prior period and growth at most of our businesses. These increases were partially offset by decreases at several other businesses which included corrective underwriting actions in   Programs   (  $8.9 million  ), as we have exited two accounts, and in   Entertainment   (  $8.1 million  ) due to a refinement of our underwriting appetite.  
  Underwriting Results 
  Pre-tax underwriting income was   $10.6 million   for   the third quarter of   2016  , compared to pre-tax underwriting income of   $3.7 million   for   the third quarter of   2015   driven by the factors discussed below. 
  Our combined ratio for   the third quarter of   2016   of   96.2%   reflected a   58.6%   loss and LAE ratio and a   37.6%   expense ratio, which compared to a combined ratio for   the third quarter of   2015   of   98.8%  , consisting of a   59.5%   loss and LAE ratio and a   39.3%   expense ratio.  
  The   0.9   point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio was comprised of a   0.9 point   decrease in current accident year non-catastrophe losses, as   1.1 points   of catastrophe losses and   no   net loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves for   the third quarter of   2016   were both consistent with the   third quarter   of   2015  . 
    Current accident year non-catastrophe losses for   the third quarter of   2016   of   $159.9 million  , or   57.5 points  , compared to   $164.4 million  , or   58.4 points  , for the   2015   period driven by the improved relative performance of many of our businesses, most notably,   Ocean Marine  , and to a lesser extent,   Accident  , which more than offset the prior period benefiting from the exit of   Crop   and the impact of an increased current accident year provision within   Healthcare.    
  There was   no   net loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves in   the third quarter of   2016  , as modest unfavorable reserve development, primarily in   Ocean Marine   was offset by modest favorable reserve development driven by   Entertainment   and   Accident  . There was also   no   net loss and LAE reserve development on prior accident year reserves in   the third quarter of   2015  , as favorable development from several businesses, most notably   Technology  ,   Specialty Property   and   Collector Cars and Boats   was offset by unfavorable development primarily due to an increase in large and small claims in   Entertainment  , and to a lesser extent, unusually heavy activity of both large and small claims in   Ocean Marine   and also   Programs  .  
  Catastrophe losses of   $2.9 million  , or   1.1 points  , in   the third quarter of   2016  , primarily resulting from wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States impacting   Ocean Marine   and   Government Risks,   compared to   $3.1 million  , or   1.1 points  , for   the third quarter of   2015  , primarily resulting from wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States, particularly Texas. 
  The expense ratio decreased   1.7   points to   37.6%   for   the third quarter of   2016  , compared to   39.3%   for   the third quarter of   2015  , driven by the adverse impact of the   Crop   exit on the prior period, the favorable current period impact resulting from the final settlement of the OneBeacon qualified pension plan liability, and the continued efforts to reduce controllable expenses including reduced salary expense due to headcount reductions. These favorable changes were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of decreased earned premiums and increased commissions due to business mix in the   2016   period.  
  Investments 
  Net investment income decreased to   $11.8 million   for   the third quarter of   2016  , compared to   $12.4 million   for   the third quarter of   2015  . Net realized and change in unrealized investment gains of   $15.5 million   were significantly better than the negative   $29.9 million   in   the third quarter of   2015  . The significant increase was driven by a higher return from our common equity securities portfolio due to improved market conditions for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  , and a higher return from our other investments portfolio due to a positive   $8.7 million   valuation adjustment on the surplus notes driven by changes in credit spreads for   the third quarter of   2016   compared to a negative   $8.4 million   valuation adjustment for   the third quarter of      2015  . 
  Other Revenues (Expenses) 
  The   $2.1 million   unfavorable change in other revenues (expenses) compared to   the third quarter of   2015   was driven by the prior period benefiting from the   $3.0 million   Crop Transaction Fee. 
  Income Taxes 
  Our income tax expense related to pre-tax income from continuing operations represented a net effective tax rate of   14.0%   for   the third quarter of   2016   compared to a net effective benefit of   20.8%   for   the third quarter of   2015  . The effective tax rate for   the third quarter of   2016   and   2015   were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to income generated in jurisdictions other than the United States, principally representing interest income and underwriting income taxed in a

     Table of Contents  

jurisdiction with a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate on non-U.S. income for   the third quarter of   2016   and   2015   was   0.4%   and   2.9%  , respectively. 
  Reinsurance Protection 
  We purchase reinsurance in order to minimize loss from large risks or catastrophic events. We also purchase individual property reinsurance coverage for certain risks to reduce large loss volatility through property-per-risk excess of loss reinsurance programs and individual risk facultative reinsurance. We also maintain excess of loss casualty reinsurance programs that provide protection for individual risk or catastrophe losses involving workers' compensation, general liability, automobile liability, professional liability or umbrella liability. The availability and cost of reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions, which are outside of our control. Limiting our risk of loss through reinsurance arrangements serves to mitigate the impact of large losses; however, the cost of this protection in an individual period may exceed the benefit.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our net combined ratio was higher than our gross combined ratio by   2.8 points   as a result of the cost of the reinsurance programs more than offsetting the benefits from ceded losses. For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , our net combined ratio was lower than our gross combined ratio by   6.8 points   as a result of the impact in the quarter of entering into the 100% quota share reinsurance agreements related to the   Crop   business. 
  Consolidated Results    Nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Our comprehensive income attributable to OneBeacon's common shareholders was   $99.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $14.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , with the change driven primarily by a   $91.8 million   increase in pre-tax investment results due to higher net realized and change in unrealized gains in our common equity securities, other investments and fixed maturity investment portfolios driven by the factors discussed below in "Summary of Investment Results." Additionally, the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included a   $16.3 million   tax benefit resulting from the settlement of IRS examinations for tax years 2007 through 2012. Partially offsetting these increases were pre-tax underwriting results of   $16.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $33.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as the current period was impacted by the significant underwriting losses in the   Healthcare   and   Programs   business units.    
  Our total revenues of   $926.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $36.3 million   from   $890.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , driven by the   $91.8 million   increase in pre-tax investment results which was partially offset by a decrease in earned premiums of   $59.4 million  , or   6.7%  , driven by decreases at   Healthcare,   and to a lesser extent,   Other Professional Lines   and   Entertainment  .  
  Written Premiums 
  Consolidated net written premiums were   $865.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   4.0%   from the comparative prior year period. The significant decrease in net written premiums was primarily driven by decreases at   Programs   (  $19.5 million  ), as we have exited two accounts,   Healthcare   (  $16.7 million  ), reflecting the impact of corrective underwriting actions and increased competition, and in   Entertainment   (  $17.1 million  ) due to a refinement of our underwriting appetite. 
  Underwriting Results 
  Our pre-tax underwriting income was   $16.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to pre-tax underwriting income of   $33.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   driven by the factors discussed below. 
  Our combined ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   98.0%   reflected a   60.5%   loss and LAE ratio and a   37.5%   expense ratio, which compared to a combined ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   96.3%  , consisting of a   59.5%   loss and LAE ratio and a   36.8%   expense ratio.  
  The   1.0   point increase in the loss and LAE ratio was comprised of a   2.1   point unfavorable change in prior accident year loss reserve development, offset by a   0.8   point decrease in current accident year non-catastrophe losses and a   0.3   point decrease in catastrophe losses. 
  Current accident year non-catastrophe losses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $475.2 million  , or   57.3   points, compared to   $515.4 million  , or   58.1   points, for the   2015   period driven by the improved relative performance by many of our businesses in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , most notably   Ocean Marine  ,   Accident   and   Inland Marine  , which were partially offset by increased current accident year provisions within   Healthcare   and   Programs  . 
  There was   1.9 points   of net unfavorable prior year loss and LAE reserve development in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , driven by   Healthcare,   and to a lesser extent,     unfavorable development in     the Architects and Engineers sub-line within   Other Professional Lines,   and   Programs   as well as other businesses  ,   which was partially offset by favorable development principally in   Technology  ,   Accident   and   Financial Services  . This compared with   $1.8 million  , or   0.2   points, of net favorable prior year loss and LAE reserve development for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily attributable to favorable development from   Technology  , and to a lesser extent, from   Specialty Property  ,   Crop  ,   Surety  ,   Collector Cars and  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

Boats   and   Government Risks  . This favorable development was mostly offset by unfavorable development due to several large losses and small to mid-sized claims in   Entertainment  , and to a lesser extent, losses in   Inland Marine   as well as   Tuition Reimbursement   and   Programs  .  
  Catastrophe losses of   $10.7 million  , or   1.3   points, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily resulting from wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States impacting   Ocean Marine   and   Government Risks   and wind and thunderstorms in Texas impacting   Inland Marine   and   Financial Services  . This compared to   $14.3 million  , or   1.6   points, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily resulting from wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States, particularly Texas, and winter storms in the northeastern United States. 
  The expense ratio increased   0.7   points to   37.5%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   36.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , driven by the negative impact of lower earned premiums and increased commissions due to business mix in the   2016   period more than offsetting reduced salary and incentive compensation expense driven by headcount reductions in the current period and lower relative incentive compensation performance factors. 
  Investments 
  Net investment income increased to   $38.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $33.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   driven by a   $2.4 million   interest payment on the surplus notes, along with an increase in the yield and a higher allocation to fixed maturity investments. Net realized and change in unrealized investment gains of   $56.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased significantly compared to negative   $29.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   driven by strong performance across all asset classes. Our common equity securities portfolio return increased driven by improved market conditions for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The other investments portfolio included a favorable change in unrealized investment gain from the surplus notes of   $20.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulting primarily from changes in credit spreads compared to a   $7.3 million   net unfavorable change in unrealized investment gains from the surplus notes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In addition, our fixed maturity investments portfolio return increased driven by interest rate movements in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other Revenues (Expenses) 
  Other revenues (expenses) increased by   $3.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   driven by the prior year impact of a   $3.7 million   negative adjustment to the pre-tax gain on the sale of Essentia. The prior year period was also impacted by a   $1.6 million   pre-tax write-off of certain capitalized software and a   $1.2 million   loss on the sale of real estate, which were mostly offset by the Crop Transaction Fee of   $3.0 million  .  
  Income Taxes 
  Our income tax expense related to pre-tax income from continuing operations represented a net effective tax benefit of   6.5%   and   7.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to the impact of a   $16.3 million   favorable settlement of IRS examinations for the 2007 through 2012 tax years. The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to income generated in jurisdictions other than the United States, principally representing interest income and underwriting income taxed in a jurisdiction with a lower effective tax rate, which also provided a benefit to the current period. The effective tax rate on non-U.S. income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   0.6%   and   1.7%  , respectively. 
  Reinsurance Protection 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our net combined ratio was higher than our gross combined ratio by   3.9   points and   0.7   points, respectively, as a result of the cost of the reinsurance programs more than offsetting the benefits from ceded losses.

The following table provides underwriting ratios for Specialty Products for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  : 

The impact of certain items to our underwriting ratios was as follows: 

Specialty Products Three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net written premiums for Specialty Products increased to   $177.1 million   for   the third quarter of   2016   from   $133.7 million   for the comparative   2015   period. The significant increase was driven by the prior period impact of ceded written premiums of   $35.9 million   from the exit of   Crop   and growth at nearly all of our businesses, most notably   Healthcare   (  $5.4 million  ) and   Surety   (  $3.8 million  ). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in   Programs   (  $8.9 million  ) due to corrective underwriting actions as we have exited two accounts. 
  The Specialty Products combined ratio for   the third quarter of   2016   increased to   98.8%   from   93.9%   for   the third quarter of   2015  , as the loss and LAE ratio increased by   10.2   points to   63.0%  , and the expense ratio decreased by   5.3   points to   35.8%  .  
  The   10.2   point increase to the loss and LAE ratio in   the third quarter of   2016   compared to the   2015   period was comprised of a   4.1   point increase in current accident year non-catastrophe losses, a   6.5   point unfavorable change in net prior year loss reserve development and a   0.4   point decrease in catastrophe losses.  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

The current accident year non-catastrophe loss ratio for   the third quarter of   2016   was   61.0%  , compared to   56.9%   for   the third quarter of   2015  , with the increase driven by the prior period benefiting from the exit of   Crop,   and an increased current accident year provision in   Healthcare  , and to a lesser extent, the Architects and Engineers sub-line within   Other Professional Lines   driven by losses exceeding historical trends. 
  The   third quarter   of   2016   results included   1.9   points of net unfavorable prior accident year loss reserve development, driven by modest unfavorable reserve development from several businesses, including the     Architects and Engineers sub-line within   Other Professional Lines.   This compared with   4.6   points of net favorable prior year loss reserve development in   the third quarter of   2015  , primarily related to favorable loss reserve development in   Specialty Property  ,   Collector Cars and Boats  ,   Surety   and   Financial Services   that was partially offset by unfavorable loss reserve development primarily in our   Programs   underwriting operating segment.  
  The   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015   both included fairly benign catastrophe losses of   0.1   points and   0.5   points, respectively.  
  The   5.3   point decrease in the expense ratio for   the third quarter of   2016  , compared to   the third quarter of   2015  , was driven by the adverse impact of the   Crop   exit on the prior period, the favorable current period impact resulting from the final settlement of the OneBeacon qualified pension plan liability, and continued efforts to reduce controllable expenses including reduced salary expense due to headcount reductions. These favorable changes were partially offset by increased commissions due to business mix and lower earned premium volumes when excluding the prior period impact of the   $16.8 million   of ceded earned premiums related to   Crop  .   
  Specialty Products Nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus nine months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net written premiums for Specialty Products decreased slightly to   $423.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $427.0 million   for the comparative   2015   period. The decrease was driven by decreases at   Programs   (  $19.5 million  ), as we have exited two accounts, and   Healthcare   (  $16.7 million  ) reflecting the impact of corrective underwriting actions and increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by the adverse impact of the   Crop   exit on the prior period (  $9.4 million  ) and increases at most of our other businesses, most notably   Financial Institutions   (  $4.7 million  ) which was formed in the fourth quarter of 2015, and   Environmental   (  $4.4 million  ).   
  The Specialty Products combined ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased to   105.5%   from   91.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as the loss and LAE ratio increased by   13.7   points to   69.8%  , and the expense ratio increased by   0.4   points to   35.7%  .  
  The   13.7   point increase to the loss and LAE ratio was comprised of a   2.3   point increase in current accident year non-catastrophe losses, a   11.2   point unfavorable change in net prior accident year loss reserve development and a   0.2   point increase in catastrophe losses.  
  The current accident year non-catastrophe loss ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   60.8%  , compared to   58.5%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , driven primarily by   Healthcare  , as well as a higher accident year provision in our   Programs   business.  
  The results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   8.4   points of net unfavorable prior accident year loss reserve development, driven by the significant unfavorable development in   Healthcare   (  $31.1 million  ), and to a lesser extent, in     the Architects and Engineers sub-line (  $10.7 million  ) within   Other Professional Lines   and   Programs   (  $9.7 million  )  ,   which was partially offset by favorable development primarily in   Financial Services   (  $6.6 million  )  ,   the Media sub-line (  $4.7 million  ) within   Other Professional Lines   and   Specialty Property   (  $3.8 million  ). This compared with   2.8   points of net favorable prior accident year loss reserve development for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   driven by favorable loss reserve development in   Specialty Property  ,   Crop  ,   Surety  ,   Collector Cars and Boats  , and   Financial Services   that was partially offset by unfavorable loss reserve development primarily in our   Tuition Reimbursement   and   Programs   underwriting operating segments. 
  The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   0.6   points of catastrophe losses primarily resulting from wind and thunderstorms in Texas impacting   Financial Services   in the second quarter, compared to   0.4   points of catastrophe losses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily related to wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States. 
  The   0.4   point increase in the expense ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was driven by the negative impact of lower earned premiums and increased commissions due to business mix in the   2016   period more than offsetting reduced salary and incentive compensation expense driven by headcount reductions in the current period and lower relative incentive compensation performance factors.

Specialty Industries 
  Financial results for our Specialty Industries reportable segment for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

The following table provides underwriting ratios for Specialty Industries for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  : 

The impact of certain items to our underwriting ratios was as follows: 

Specialty Industries Three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net written premiums for Specialty Industries decreased to   $147.0 million   for   the third quarter of   2016   from   $159.2 million   for the comparative   2015   period. The decrease in   the third quarter of   2016   was driven by an   $8.1 million   decrease at our   Entertainment   business due to a refinement of our underwriting appetite along with decreases at several other businesses.   
  The Specialty Industries combined ratio for   the third quarter of   2016   decreased to   93.8%  , compared to   102.6%   for   the third quarter of   2015  , as the loss and LAE ratio decreased by   10.2   points to   54.5%  , and the expense ratio increased by   1.4   points to   39.3%  .  
  The   10.2   point decrease to the loss and LAE ratio was comprised of a   5.4   point decrease in current accident year non-catastrophe losses, a   5.2   point favorable change in prior year loss reserve development and a   0.4   point increase in catastrophe losses.   
  The current accident year non-catastrophe loss ratio for   the third quarter of   2016   was   54.3%  , compared to   59.7%   for   the third quarter of   2015  , driven by the improved relative performance of most of our businesses, most notably   Ocean Marine,   which was adversely impacted by an increase in the frequency of small to medium losses in the   2015   period, and to a lesser extent,   Accident   driven by favorable case incurred activity compared to the   2015   period.  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

Results for   the third quarter of   2016   included   1.7   points of net favorable prior accident year loss reserve development driven by   Entertainment   and   Accident   resulting from better than expected case incurred activity, which was partially offset by unfavorable development primarily in   Ocean Marine   driven by several large losses. This compared to   3.5   points of net unfavorable prior accident year loss reserve development in   the third quarter of   2015  , driven by   Entertainment   due to an increase in large and small liability claims, as well as property claims, and unusually heavy case incurred activity in   Ocean Marine  , partially offset by favorable prior accident year loss reserve development in   Technology  .  
  Results for   the third quarter of   2016   included   1.9   points of catastrophe losses, primarily resulting from wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States impacting   Ocean Marine   and   Government Risks  . This compared to   1.5   points of catastrophe losses in   the third quarter of   2015  , primarily related to wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States, particularly Texas, impacting   Inland Marine   and   Government Risks. 
  The   1.4   point increase in the expense ratio for   the third quarter of   2016  , compared to   the third quarter of   2015  , was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of decreased earned premiums in the   2016   period and increased commissions due to business mix more than offsetting the favorable current period impact resulting from the final settlement of the OneBeacon qualified pension plan liability and continued efforts to reduce controllable expenses including reduced salary expense due to headcount reductions.  
  Specialty Industries Nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus nine months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net written premiums for Specialty Industries decreased to   $441.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $474.2 million   for the comparative   2015   period. The decrease in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was driven by declines at all business units primarily resulting from increased competition and due to a decrease of   $17.1 million     in   Entertainment   as a result of a refinement of our underwriting appetite.  
  The Specialty Industries combined ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased to   91.3%  , compared to   100.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as the loss and LAE ratio decreased by   10.4   points to   52.2%  , partially offset by the expense ratio which increased   0.9   points to   39.1%  .  
  The   10.4   point decrease to the loss and LAE ratio was comprised of a   3.2   point decrease in current accident year non-catastrophe losses, a   6.4   point favorable change in prior year loss reserve development and a   0.8   point decrease in catastrophe losses.   
  The current accident year non-catastrophe loss ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   54.4%  , compared to   57.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , driven by the improved performance of all of our businesses, most notably   Ocean Marine   and   Inland Marine   which were adversely impacted by heavy loss activity in the   2015   period and also   Accident   resulting from favorable case incurred activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   4.1   points of net favorable prior accident year loss reserve development driven by   Technology   (  $9.7 million  ) and   Accident   (  $9.4 million  )     resulting from better than expected case incurred activity. This favorable prior accident year loss reserve development was partially offset by minimal unfavorable development in the other business units. This compared to   2.3   points of net unfavorable prior accident year loss reserve development in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily driven by   Entertainment   due to an increase in large and small liability claims, as well as property claims, and to a lesser extent, elevated claims in   Inland Marine   which were partially offset by favorable prior accident year loss reserve development in   Technology,   and to a lesser extent,   Government Risks  .  
  Results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   1.9   points of catastrophe losses, driven by wind and thunderstorms in Texas impacting   Inland Marine   during the second quarter and wind and thunderstorms in the southern United States impacting   Ocean Marine   and   Government Risks   during the third quarter.     This compared to   2.7   points of catastrophe losses in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily related to winter storms in the northeastern United States impacting   Ocean Marine   and   Entertainment  , and wind and thunderstorms in the midwestern and southern United States, particularly Texas, impacting   Government Risks   and   Inland Marine  .   
  The   0.9   point increase in the expense ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was primarily driven by the negative impact of lower earned premiums in   2016   more than offsetting reduced salary and incentive compensation expense driven by headcount reductions in the current period and lower relative incentive compensation performance factors.

Investing, Financing and Corporate 
  A summary of results from our Investing, Financing and Corporate reportable segment for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

Investing, Financing and Corporate Three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Investing, Financing and Corporate reported pre-tax income from continuing operations of   $22.4 million   in   the third quarter of   2016  , compared to a loss of   $20.4 million   in   the third quarter of   2015  . The significant increase was driven by a higher return from our common equity securities portfolio due to improved market conditions for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  , and a higher return from our other investments portfolio due to a positive   $8.7 million   valuation adjustment on the surplus notes driven by changes in credit spreads for   the third quarter of   2016   compared to a negative   $8.4 million   valuation adjustment for the   third quarter   of   2015  . 
  Investing, Financing and Corporate Nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus nine months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Investing, Financing and Corporate reported pre-tax income from continuing operations of   $78.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a loss of   $18.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The significant increase was driven by the strong performance of all asset classes.  Our common equity securities portfolio return increased driven by improved market conditions for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The other investments portfolio included a favorable impact from surplus notes of   $22.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulting primarily from changes in credit spreads compared to a   $7.3 million   net unfavorable surplus note impact for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In addition, our fixed maturity investments portfolio return increased driven by interest rate movements in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
   
  Discontinued Operations  
  There was   no   gain or loss related to discontinued operations for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million   for   the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015  , respectively, was the result of post-closing expenses incurred in connection with the Runoff Business.  
  The gain from sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   represents a positive adjustment to the estimated loss on sale taking into consideration the final settlement of certain post-closing items.

Summary of Investment Results 
  OneBeacon invests to maximize long-term total returns (after-tax) while taking prudent levels of risk and maintaining a diversified portfolio, subject to investment guidelines and regulatory restrictions. During the third quarter of 2016, OneBeacon established a portfolio of high-yield fixed maturity investments. The fair value of high-yield investments held as of September 30, 2016 was   $62.4 million  . Given the risk profile of these investments, OneBeacon's management believes that the returns associated with the high-yield fixed maturity investments are more appropriately included with the returns from common equity securities and other investments instead of with returns associated with short-term investments and investment grade fixed maturity investments.  See "  INVESTMENT RETURN     NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE  " on page 61.

   Investment Returns Three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus three months ended   September 30, 2015 
  Overview 
  Our total pre-tax investment results were   $27.3 million  , a return on average invested assets of   1.1%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to negative   $17.5 million  , a return on average invested assets of   (0.6)%  , for the three

     Table of Contents  

months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to a higher return on our common equity securities, driven by positive market returns as well as outperformance of the S P 500 Index in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to negative market returns and underperformance of the S P 500 Index in the   third quarter   of   2015  . Additionally, our other investments portfolio generated a higher return for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , driven by an   $8.7 million   positive valuation adjustment on the surplus notes, resulting primarily from changes in credit spreads, compared to a   $8.4 million   negative valuation adjustment for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Fixed income 
  Our fixed income portfolio, which includes fixed maturity and short-term investments, returned   0.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was due primarily to a modest rise in interest rates in   the third quarter of   2016   compared to a modest decline in interest rates in   the third quarter of   2015  . We maintained a high quality fixed maturity investments portfolio with a relatively short duration of approximately   2.2   years excluding short-term investments and approximately   2.1   years including short-term investments, as of   September 30, 2016  . As of September 30, 2016, the fixed income portfolio duration, including short-term investments but excluding high-yield fixed maturity investments, was approximately   2.0   years. Our fixed income portfolio outperformed the longer-duration Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Index return by   20 basis points   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and underperformed the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Index return by   50 basis points   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Excluding high-yield fixed maturity investments, the fixed income portfolio returned   0.5%   for   the third quarter of   2016  , outperforming the longer duration Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Index return of   0.3%   for   the third quarter of   2016  . 
  Common equity securities, other investments, and high-yield fixed maturity investments 
  Our total common equity securities and other investments portfolio returned   4.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   (6.3)%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our common equity securities portfolio returned   5.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   (7.4)%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The results from our common equity securities portfolio outperformed the S P 500 Index return by   130 basis points   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and underperformed by   100 basis points   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  The portfolio of common equity securities, other investments and high-yield fixed maturity investments returned   4.2%   for the third quarter. These results underperformed the S P 500 Index returns of   3.9%   for the comparable period.  The underperformance relative to the S P 500 Index for the third quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to unfavorable performance in other investments, which were impacted by write-downs in energy-exposed private equity funds, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market adjustments to the surplus notes.  
  The following summarizes OneBeacon's investments in ETFs by exposure to each index:   

  In the third quarter of 2016, the ETF investments earned the effective market return, before expenses, in each respective fund. OneBeacon continues to invest in publicly-traded common equity securities which are actively managed through White Mountains Advisors LLC. The portfolio had overweight exposure to the communications and healthcare sectors and underweight exposure to the consumer staples and financials sectors for both periods as compared to the S P 500 Index.  
  Other investments, which are composed principally of surplus notes, private equity funds and hedge funds, returned   3.6%   and   (4.3)%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our other investments portfolio outperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index return by   130 basis points   and underperformed the S P 500 Index by   30 basis points   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The performance was impacted by an   $8.7 million   positive valuation adjustment on the surplus notes, resulting primarily from changes in credit spreads. When excluding the   $8.7 million   positive valuation adjustment on the surplus notes, the portfolio underperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index return by   650 basis points   and the S P 500 Index by   810 basis points   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This underperformance was driven largely by our private equity investments focused on energy infrastructure and services. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our other investments portfolio underperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index by   190 basis points  . This underperformance was due largely to a negative   $8.4 million   valuation adjustment on the

surplus notes. When excluding the negative   $8.4 million   valuation adjustment on the surplus notes, the portfolio outperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index by   340 basis points   for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Investment Returns Nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus nine months ended   September 30, 2015 
  Overview 
  Our total pre-tax investment results were   $95.1 million   a return on average invested assets of   3.8%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 million  , a return on average invested assets of   0.3%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was due in part to a higher return on our common equity securities portfolio, which was impacted by positive market returns in the first nine months of 2016 compared to negative market returns in the first nine months of 2015. Our other investments portfolio also generated a higher return for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , driven by positive valuation adjustments of   $20.0 million   on the surplus notes, resulting primarily from changes in credit spreads, compared to net negative valuation adjustments of   $7.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, our fixed maturity investments portfolio generated a higher return for the 2016 period, driven by generally declining interest rates in the first nine months of 2016 compared to generally flat interest rates in the first nine months of 2015. 
  Fixed income 
  Our fixed income portfolio, which includes fixed maturity and short-term investments, returned   2.9%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.5%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , with the increase driven primarily by the impact of declining interest rates during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Our fixed income portfolio underperformed the longer-duration Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Index return by   120 basis points   and   20 basis points   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Excluding high-yield fixed maturity investments, the fixed income portfolio returned   2.9%   for the first nine months of 2016, underperforming the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Index return of   4.1%   for the first nine months of 2016.  The underperformance relative to the benchmark for the first nine months of 2016 was primarily attributable to the short duration positioning of the portfolio as interest rates declined over the course of the nine month period. 
  Common equity securities and other investments, and high-yield fixed maturity investments 
  Our total common equity securities and other investments portfolio returned   9.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   (5.1)%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Our common equity securities portfolio returned   6.3%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   (4.9)%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The results from our common equity securities portfolio underperformed the S P 500 Index return by   150 basis points   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and outperformed the S P 500 Index return by   40 basis points   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The portfolio of common equity securities, other long-term investments and high-yield fixed maturity investments returned   8.9%   for the third quarter of 2016.  These results underperformed the S P 500 Index return of   7.8%   for the comparable period. The underperformance relative to the S P 500 Index for the third quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to unfavorable performance in other investments, which were impacted by write-downs in energy-exposed private equity funds, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market adjustments to the surplus notes. 
  Other investments, which are composed principally of surplus notes, private equity funds, and hedge funds, returned   14.1%   and   (5.5)%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our other investments portfolio outperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index return by   1,160 basis points   and outperformed the S P 500 Index by   630 basis points   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The performance was impacted by a   $22.4 million   return on the surplus notes, which included net investment income of   $2.4 million   resulting from the receipt of an interest payment, along with a   $20.0 million   positive valuation adjustment, resulting primarily from changes in credit spreads. When excluding the   $22.4 million   positive total return on the surplus notes, the portfolio underperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index return by   500 basis points   and underperformed the S P500 Index by   1,030 basis points  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The underperformance was driven by unfavorable results across our private equity portfolio. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , our other investments portfolio underperformed the HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies Index by   460 basis points  . This underperformance was due to a negative   $7.3 million   net valuation adjustment on the surplus notes as well as unfavorable results in energy-focused private equity funds.

INVESTMENT RETURN     NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE 
  In the third quarter of 2016, OneBeacon purchased high-yield fixed maturity investments, which are U.S. dollar denominated publicly traded and 144A debt securities issued by corporations with generally at least one rating between "B-" and "BB+" inclusive by Standard and Poor's or similar ratings from other agencies. Given the risk profile of these investments, OneBeacon has included returns on high-yield fixed maturity investment returns with returns on common equity securities and other investments.  A reconciliation of these returns follows:

   (1)    High-yield fixed maturity investments returned 1.0% for the third quarter of 2016. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Operating Cash and Short-term Investments 
  Our sources and uses of cash are as follows: 
  Holding company level.    The primary sources of cash for OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. (OneBeacon Ltd.) and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries are expected to be distributions and tax sharing payments received from our insurance operating subsidiaries, capital raising activities, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of holding company investments. The primary uses of cash are expected to be interest payments on our debt obligations, repurchases and retirements of our debt obligations, dividend payments on our common shares, common share repurchases, purchases of investments, payments made to tax authorities, contributions to our operating subsidiaries, and holding company operating expenses. 
  Operating subsidiary level.    The primary sources of cash for our operating subsidiaries are expected to be premium collections, net investment income, capital raising activities, contributions from our holding companies, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. The primary uses of cash are expected to be claim payments, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses, interest payments on internal debt obligations, repurchases and retirements of internal debt obligations, purchases of investments, and distributions and tax sharing payments made to parent holding companies. 
  Insurance companies typically collect premiums on policies that they write prior to paying claims made under those policies. During periods of premium growth, insurance companies typically experience positive cash flow from operations, as premium receipts typically exceed claim payments and other operating expenses. When this happens, positive cash flow from operations is usually offset by negative cash flow from investing activities, as the positive operating cash flow is used to purchase investments. Conversely, during periods of premium decline, insurance companies typically experience negative cash flow from operations, even during periods in which they report net income, as the claims and other operating expenses that they pay exceed the premiums that they collect. When this happens, negative cash flow from operations is typically offset by positive cash flow from investing activities, as invested assets are sold to fund current claim and expense payments.  
  Both internal and external forces influence our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, sometimes several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss. The exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty. Our operating subsidiaries maintain portfolios of invested assets with varying maturities and a substantial amount of cash and short-term investments to provide adequate liquidity for the payment of claims. 
  Management believes that our cash balances, cash flows from operations and cash flows from investments are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and operating subsidiary level.

Dividend Capacity 
  Under the insurance laws of the states and jurisdictions under which our insurance operating subsidiaries are domiciled, an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing and the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities. Accordingly, there can be no assurance regarding the amount of such dividends that may be paid by such subsidiaries in the future. 
  Our top tier regulated U.S. insurance operating subsidiary, Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company (ASIC), has the ability to pay dividends to its immediate parent without the prior approval of regulatory authorities in an amount set by formula based on the lesser of (i) adjusted net investment income, as defined by statute, or (ii) 10% of statutory surplus, in both cases as most recently reported to regulatory authorities, subject to availability of earned surplus. Based upon the formula described above, most recently calculated as of June 30, 2016, ASIC currently has the ability to pay   $5.7 million   of dividends without the prior approval of regulatory authorities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, ASIC paid   $26.5 million  , with no such dividends paid in the three months ended September 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, ASIC had   $603.6 million   of statutory surplus and   $43.1 million   of earned surplus.  
  During   2016  , Split Rock has the ability to pay dividends and make distributions without the prior approval of regulatory authorities, subject to meeting all appropriate liquidity and solvency requirements, of up to   $37.4 million  , which is equal to   15%   of its   December 31, 2015   statutory capital and surplus.  As of   December 31, 2015  , Split Rock had   $249.5 million   of statutory capital and surplus. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Split Rock paid   $25.0 million   of dividends to its immediate parent. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our unregulated insurance operating subsidiaries paid   $5.2 million   of dividends to their immediate parent. As of   September 30, 2016  , our unregulated insurance operating subsidiaries had   $63.7 million   of net unrestricted cash, short-term investments, and fixed maturity investments and   $71.5 million   of other investments consisting of the surplus notes. 
  As described in Note 14 "Common Shareholders' Equity" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we declared and paid dividends totaling   $59.4 million   and   $60.0 million  , respectively, to our common shareholders. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , OneBeacon Ltd. and its intermediate holding company subsidiaries held   $89.6 million   of net unrestricted cash, short-term investments and fixed maturity investments and   $11.5 million   of common equity securities outside of its regulated and unregulated insurance operating subsidiaries. 
  Insurance Float 
  Insurance float is an important aspect of our insurance operations. Insurance float represents funds that an insurance company holds for a limited time. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are collected before losses are paid. This interval can extend over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the funds. When the premiums that an insurer collects do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay, the result is an underwriting loss, which can be considered as the cost of insurance float. One manner in which we calculate our insurance float is by taking our insurance liabilities and subtracting insurance assets. Although insurance float can be calculated using numbers determined under GAAP, insurance float is not a GAAP concept and, therefore, there is no comparable GAAP measure. 
  Insurance float can increase in a number of ways, including through acquisitions of insurance operations, organic growth in existing insurance operations and recognition of losses that do not immediately cause a corresponding reduction in investment assets. Conversely, insurance float can decrease in a number of other ways, including sales of insurance operations, shrinking or run-off of existing insurance operations, the acquisition of operations that do not have substantial investment assets (e.g., an agency) and the recognition of gains that do not cause a corresponding increase in investment assets. We intend to generate low-cost float over time through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. However, we seek to increase overall profits sometimes by reducing float, such as in the Runoff Transaction. 
  Certain operational leverage metrics can be measured with ratios that are calculated using insurance float. There are many activities that do not change the amount of insurance float at an insurance company but can have a significant impact on the company's operational leverage metrics. For example, investment gains and losses, debt issuances and repurchases/repayments, common share issuances and repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders are all activities that do not change insurance float but that can meaningfully impact operational leverage metrics that are calculated using insurance float.

The following table illustrates our consolidated insurance float position and two operational leverage ratios based on insurance float as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , insurance float decreased by   $33.4 million  , primarily due to the slight contraction of our insurance operations.  
  Financing 
  Debt 
  The following table summarizes our debt to capital ratio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

We believe that we have the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally as needed through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. However, we can provide no assurance that, if needed, we would be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
  On September 29, 2015, the Company and OneBeacon Holdings, Inc. (OBH), as co-borrowers and co-guarantors, entered into a revolving credit facility administered by U.S. Bank N.A. (U.S. Bank) and including BMO Harris Bank N.A. as an additional lender, which has a total commitment of   $65.0 million   and has a maturity date of September 29, 2019 (Credit Facility). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Credit Facility was undrawn.  
  The Credit Facility contains various affirmative, negative and financial covenants which OneBeacon considers to be customary for such borrowings, including certain minimum net worth and maximum debt to capitalization standards. These covenants can restrict the Company, OBH and their respective subsidiaries in several ways, including their ability to incur additional indebtedness. An uncured breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Facility, which would allow lenders to declare any amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. 
  In November 2012, OBH issued   $275.0 million   face value of senior unsecured notes (2012 Senior Notes) through a public offering, at an issue price of   99.9%   and received   $272.9 million   of proceeds. The 2012 Senior Notes bear an annual interest rate of   4.6%   payable semi-annually in arrears on May 9 and November 9, until maturity on November 9, 2022, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the Company.

     Table of Contents  

The 2012 Senior Notes were issued under indentures that contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, OBH, and their respective subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and limit the ability of the Company and OBH to consolidate, merge or transfer their properties and assets. The indentures do not contain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which the Company or OBH must adhere. In addition, a failure by the Company, OBH or their respective subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on covered debt, where such failure results in the acceleration of at least   $75.0 million   of the principal amount of covered debt, could trigger the acceleration of the 2012 Senior Notes. 
    
  Interest payments on the 2012 Senior Notes totaled   $6.3 million   for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and OBH were in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2012 Senior Notes and the Credit Facility, and anticipate they will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03,   Imputation of Interest   (ASC 835), which requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, consistent with the treatment required for debt discounts. OneBeacon has applied the guidance retrospectively and as a result has reclassified   $1.9 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets, reflecting these amounts as reduction from the related debt. 
  Capital Lease 
  In December 2011, we sold the majority of our then-owned fixed assets and capitalized software. We entered into lease financing arrangements with U.S. Bank and Fifth Third Equipment Finance Company (Fifth Third) whereby we sold furniture and equipment and capitalized software, respectively, at a cost equal to net book value. We then leased the fixed assets back from U.S. Bank for a lease term of five years and leased the capitalized software back from Fifth Third for a lease term of four years. We received cash proceeds of   $23.1 million   as a result of entering into the sale-leaseback transactions.  
  In December 2015, the lease agreement with Fifth Third expired and the Company purchased the leased assets under the agreement with a remaining book value of   $1.3 million   for a nominal fee. At the end of the lease term with US Bancorp on December 31, 2016, the Company will purchase the leased furniture and equipment assets for a nominal fee, and all rights, title and interest will transfer back to it. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a capital lease obligation of   $0.3 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, included within other liabilities and a capital lease asset of   $1.6 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively, included within other assets.  
  Share Repurchase Authorization 
  On August 22, 2007, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to   $200.0 million   of OneBeacon's Class A common shares from time to time, subject to market conditions. Shares may be repurchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have a stated expiration date. Since the inception of this authorization, the Company has repurchased and retired   6.7 million   of its Class A common shares. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   850,349   shares were repurchased under the share repurchase authorization for   $10.6 million   at an average share price of   $12.42  .   No   shares were repurchased under the share repurchase authorization during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The amount of authorization remaining is   $75.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company repurchased   64,981   and   112,051   common shares, respectively, for   $0.9 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to satisfy employee income tax withholding pursuant to employee benefit plans. Shares repurchased pursuant to employee benefit plans do not reduce the board authorization referred to above. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   no   restricted shares were forfeited, with   1,500   such forfeitures occurring during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  Cash Flows 
  Detailed information concerning our cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   follows: 
  Cash flows from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net cash flows provided from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $54.1 million   compared to   $126.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net cash flows relating to continuing operations decreased primarily due to higher payments related to various incentive programs and higher loss payments relative to the prior year period, as well as lower premium collections.   
  Other Liquidity and Capital Resource Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we made payments with respect to our long-term incentive compensation plans totaling   $9.3 million  , in cash or by deferral into certain of our non-qualified compensation plans. These

No   shares were repurchased under the board authorization during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .

These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and judgments about historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors believed to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties or other factors which are described in more detail beginning on page 18 of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, including: 
             
    changes in interest rates, debt or equity markets or other market volatility that negatively impact our investment portfolio; 
                
    competitive forces and the cyclicality of the property and casualty insurance industry; 
                
    recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves subsequently proving to have been inadequate; 
                
    claims arising from catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods or terrorist attacks;

    our ability to successfully develop new specialty businesses;  
                
    actions taken by rating agencies from time to time with respect to us, such as financial strength or credit rating downgrades or placing our ratings on negative watch; 
                
    changes in laws or regulations, or their interpretations, which are applicable to us, our competitors, our agents or our customers; 
                
    participation in guaranty funds and mandatory market mechanisms; 
                
    changes to current shareholder dividend practice and regulatory restrictions on dividends; 
                
    credit risk exposure in certain of our business operations; 
                
    our ability to retain key personnel;

    other factors, most of which are beyond our control. 
     Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the anticipated results or developments will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences.

           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Management s Quarterly Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. 
  The Company's management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes with respect to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. 
    OTHER INFORMATION 
      
           ITEM 1.  
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     OneBeacon, and the insurance and reinsurance industry in general, is routinely subject to claims-related litigation and arbitration in the normal course of business, as well as litigation and arbitration that do not arise from, or directly relate to, claims activity.  We believe that the outcome of these proceedings, even if determined adversely, would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Deutsche Bank Litigation 
  In June 2011, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Law Debenture Company of New York and Wilmington Trust Company (collectively referred to as  Plaintiffs ), in their capacity as trustees for certain senior notes issued by the Tribune Company ( Tribune ), filed lawsuits in various jurisdictions (the  Noteholder Actions ) against numerous defendants including OneBeacon, OneBeacon-sponsored benefit plans and other affiliates of White Mountains in their capacity as former shareholders of Tribune seeking recovery of the proceeds from the sale of common stock of Tribune in connection with Tribune's leveraged buyout in 2007 (the  LBO ). Tribune filed for bankruptcy in 2008 in the Delaware bankruptcy court (the  Bankruptcy Court ). The Bankruptcy Court granted Plaintiffs permission to commence these LBO-related actions, and in 2011, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted a motion to consolidate the actions for pretrial matters and transferred all such proceedings to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs seek recovery of the proceeds received by the former Tribune shareholders on a theory of constructive fraudulent transfer asserting that Tribune purchased or repurchased its common shares without receiving fair consideration at a time when it was, or as a result of the purchases of shares, was rendered, insolvent. OneBeacon has entered into a joint defense agreement with other affiliates of White Mountains that are defendants in the action. OneBeacon and OneBeacon-sponsored benefit plans received approximately $32 million for Tribune common stock tendered in connection with the LBO. The Court granted an omnibus motion to dismiss the Noteholders Action in September 2013 and plaintiffs appealed. On March 29, 2016, a three judge panel of the U.S Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the Noteholders Action. On July 22, 2016, the Plaintiff's petition to the Second Circuit for reconsideration or for a rehearing en banc was denied in full. On September 9, 2016 the Plaintiffs filed for a writ of certiorari, seeking review in the United States Supreme Court.  
    
  In addition, OneBeacon, OneBeacon-sponsored benefit plans and other affiliates of White Mountains in their capacity as former shareholders of Tribune, along with thousands of former Tribune shareholders, have been named as defendants in an adversary proceeding brought by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of the Tribune Company (the  Committee ), on behalf of the Tribune Company, which seeks to avoid the repurchase of shares by Tribune in the LBO on a theory of intentional fraudulent transfer (the  Committee Action ). Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in 2012, and a litigation trustee replaced the Committee as plaintiff in the Committee Action. This matter was consolidated for pretrial matters with the Noteholder Actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and was stayed pending the motion to dismiss in the Noteholder Action. An omnibus motion to dismiss the shareholder defendants in the Committee Action was filed in May 2014. No amount has been accrued in connection with this matter as of   September 30, 2016  , as the amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. 
   
  ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS 
  Our business is subject to a number of risks, including those identified in Item 1A    Risk Factors  of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity and that could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to any risk factors presented or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
  ITEM 2.     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
  Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
  On August 22, 2007, the Company's Board authorized the repurchase of up to   $200.0 million   of its Class A common shares from time to time, subject to market conditions. Shares may be repurchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have a stated expiration date. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   no   shares were repurchased under the share repurchase authorization. As of   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate of 6.7 million Class A common shares were repurchased for   $125.0 million   under this authorization and retired. The amount of authorization remaining is   $75.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .
