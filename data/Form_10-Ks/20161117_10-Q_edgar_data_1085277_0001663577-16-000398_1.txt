1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES  

Description
of business    Skinvisible, Inc., (referred to as the  Company ) is focused on the development and manufacture
and sales of innovative topical, transdermal and mucosal polymer-based delivery system technologies and formulations incorporating
its patent-pending formula/process for combining hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer emulsions. The technologies and formulations
have broad industry applications within the pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, personal skincare and cosmetic arenas. Additionally,
the Company s non-dermatological formulations, offer solutions for a broad spectrum of markets women s health, pain
management, and others. The Company maintains executive and sales offices in Las Vegas, Nevada.  

History
   The Company was incorporated in Nevada on March 6, 1998, under the name of Microbial Solutions, Inc. The Company underwent
a name change on February 26, 1999, when it changed its name to Skinvisible, Inc. The Company s subsidiary s name
of Manloe Labs, Inc. was also changed to Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  

On
September 9, 2014, the Company formed Kinatri USA Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to market a premium line of scientifically
formulated skincare products powered by our patented Invisicare  technology. As part of its strategic focus on revenue generation
and creating shareholder value, Kintari USA Inc. products will be sold via network marketing.  

  The
Kintari product portfolio consists of anti-aging products to help fight the signs of aging. These products have been developed
using proven anti-aging ingredients with scientific evidence of their effectiveness at reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles
resulting in youthful looking skin. These potent ingredients will be powered by patented Invisicare technology, providing consumers
with unique, effective products which the Company believes cannot be duplicated. Additional products will be added to enhance
this product line as the Company grows and expands.  

  Skinvisible,
Inc., together with its subsidiaries, shall herein be collectively referred to as the  Company.   

Going
concern    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative
net losses of $29,408,625 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to
take place. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The
obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its
transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability
to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these
aforementioned uncertainties.  

Principles
of consolidation    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Use
of estimates    The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

  For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There are $0 and $0 in cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

  The
carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the respective fair
values due to the short maturities of these items.  

As
required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly
or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions.  

Table of Contents     

SKINVISIBLE, INC. 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  

Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;  

Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability;  

Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).  

Revenue
recognition   

   Product
sales    Revenues from the sale of products (Invisicare  polymers) are recognized when title to the products are
transferred to the customer and only when no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby
have earned the right to receive reasonably assured payments for products sold and delivered.  

   Royalty
sales    The Company also recognizes royalty revenue from licensing its patented product formulations only when earned,
when no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby have earned the right to receive
and retain reasonably assured payments.  

   Distribution
and license rights sales    The Company also recognizes revenue from distribution and license rights only when earned
(and are amortized over a five year period), when no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted,
and thereby have earned the right to receive and retain reasonably assured payments.  

   Costs
of Revenue    Cost of revenue includes raw materials, component parts, and shipping supplies. Shipping and handling costs
is not a significant portion of the cost of revenue.  

   Accounts
Receivable    Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms
requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for
collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management s best estimate
of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Management reviews each accounts receivable balance that exceeds 30 days
from the invoice date and, based on an assessment of creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that will
not be collected. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not recorded a reserve for doubtful accounts. The Company has $1,135,000
in convertible notes payable which are secured by the accounts receivable of a license agreement the Company has with Women's
Choice Pharmaceuticals, LLC on its proprietary prescription product, ProCort .  

Inventory
   Substantially all inventory consists of finished goods and are valued based upon first-in first-out ( FIFO )
cost, not in excess of market. The determination of whether the carrying amount of inventory requires a write-down is based on
an evaluation of inventory.  

Goodwill
and intangible assets    The Company follows Financial Accounting Standard Board s (FASB) Codification Topic 350-10
( ASC 350-10 ),   Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  . According to this statement, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization, but rather an annual assessment of impairment
by applying a fair-value based test. Fair value for goodwill is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised
values as appropriate. Under ASC 350-10, the carrying value of assets are calculated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable
cash flows.  

Income
taxes    The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 740-10,   Income
Taxes  , which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Stock-based
compensation    The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10   Compensation-Stock
Compensation  , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase
Plan based on the estimated fair values.  

Stock
based compensation expense recognized under ASC 718-10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $133,445
and $8,800, respectively.  

Earnings
(loss) per share    The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 260-10
  Earnings Per Share  , Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar
to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share has not been presented since the effect of the assumed exercise of options and warrants to purchase
common shares (common stock equivalents) would have an anti-dilutive effect.  

2.
FIXED ASSETS  

Fixed
assets consist of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Depreciation
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $931 and $1,185, respectively.

INVENTORY  

Inventory
consist of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

4.   
INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS  

Patents
and trademarks are capitalized at their historical cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. As of September 30,
2016, patents and trademarks total $646,169, net of $386,851 of accumulated amortization. Amortization expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $42,400 and $42,192, respectively.  

License
and distributor rights ( agreement ) were acquired by the Company in January 1999 and provide exclusive use distribution
of polymers and polymer based products. The Company has a non-expiring term on the license and distribution rights. Accordingly,
the Company annually assesses this license and distribution rights for impairment and has determined that no impairment write-down
is considered necessary as of September 30, 2016.

Company
Overview   

We,
through our wholly owned subsidiary Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals Inc., are a pharmaceutical research and development ( R D )
company that has developed and patented an innovative polymer delivery system, Invisicare  and formulated over forty topical
skin products, which we out-license globally. We were incorporated in 1998, and target an estimated $80 billion global skincare
and dermatology market and a $30 billion global over-the-counter market as well as other healthcare / medical and consumer goods
markets.  

With
the research and development complete on forty products and numerous patents issued (technology and product patents), we are ready
to monetize our investment. Our business model will continue to be to out-license our patented prescription and over-the-counter
( OTC ) products featuring Invisicare to established manufacturers and marketers of brands internationally and to
maximize profits from the products we have already out-licensed. We have also formed a commercial subsidiary, Kintari Int. Inc.
with subsidiaries Kintari USA Inc. and Kintari Canada Inc., in order to take our cosmeceutical and select OTC products with Invisicare
to market.  

The
opportunity for us to license our products continues to be a viable model as the need for pharmaceutical companies to access external
R D companies for new products due to their own down-sizing or elimination of internal R D departments. The demand for
our products is enhanced due to the granting of key US and international patents and the completed development of a number of
unique products.

Our
Plan for the Next Twelve Months  

Our
growth strategy is to:  

1.      
Generate revenue from direct sales of our cosmeceutical/OTC product line;   

2.      
Capitalize on the success of current licensees;   

3.      
Increase the value of our current pipeline; and   

4.      
Boost licensing revenues by securing additional licensees globally and develop a robust royalty revenue stream that will finance
our future growth.   

Direct
Sales of our Cosmeceutical/OTC Product Line    

Kintari
USA Inc.:    

On
September 9, 2014, we formed Kintari USA Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kintari Int. Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Skinvisible, Inc., to market a premium line of scientifically formulated skincare products powered by our patented Invisicare 
technology. We launched Kintari USA Inc. on January 15, 2015. As part of our strategic focus on revenue generation and creating
shareholder value, we plan to sell our products using a number of sales efforts, including our website, network marketing and
distribution agreements. Our sales efforts are focused in the US, Canada and China.  

Recent
Sales Efforts   

On
September 15, 2016, we licensed the exclusive world rights to our topical and transdermal cannabis products formulated with Invisicare
to CannaSkin, LLC, a cannabis product licensing company with international contacts in the medical marijuana industry.  

CannaSkin
has the exclusive license to manufacture, market and sub-license our new cannabis products. Their targets will initially include
facilities in the 25 US jurisdictions currently approved for medical marijuana as well as Canada and Israel where there is a great
demand for cannabis products supported by science.  

Skinvisible
has successfully formulated high-quality topical and transdermal cannabinoid products containing CBD and in the near future will
add THC. CBD has proven to have many therapeutic effects and it does not produce the  high  associated with THC. Cannabinoids
have been used for pain management and to treat many skin conditions, from acne, eczema, psoriasis, skin cancer, to anti-aging,
due to their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our Invisicare technology allows for the superior binding of these
products to the skin, a controlled release of the cannabinoids both topically and transdermally, as well as providing patent protection.
Cannabis is being touted as a groundbreaking health solution and Skinvisible plans to bring science-based, patent protected products
into this emerging market.  

On
September 8, 2016, Kintari Int. Inc. signed an exclusive distribution agreement with EDFA Morgan Capital Co. Ltd. ( EMC ),
located in Shenzhen, China, for Kintari  branded products for the territory of Greater China, which includes China, Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.  

According
to the agreement, EMC will sell Kintari products to Chinese consumers through a network of online shopping malls and other channels.
Additionally, EMC has presented an opportunity to provide Skinvisible s DermSafe  hand sanitizer to a chain of 3,000
hospitals in China through their electronic appointment app and  

Table of Contents     

website.
We believe there is significant value in making DermSafe accessible to 100 million Chinese patients through this service, as it
currently supports over 3,000 hospitals, 46,000 doctors and was used to make over 257 million appointments. The potential market
for DermSafe alone is vast as there are over 26,000 hospitals in China servicing a population of 1.6 billion people.  

In
addition to DermSafe, Skinvisible will supply its Kintari  branded portfolio of globally patented skincare products made
with its Invisicare  delivery technology.  

Product
Line   

The
Kintari product portfolio consists of two anti-aging products to help fight the signs of aging, a broad spectrum sunscreen along
with our latest products: Kintari s Hand   Body lotion; and our topical and transdermal cannabis products. All products
are made with our patented Invisicare technology.  

Our
anti-aging products have been developed using proven anti-aging ingredients with scientific evidence of their effectiveness at
reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles resulting in youthful looking skin. These potent ingredients will be powered by patented
Invisicare technology, providing consumers with unique, effective products which we believe cannot be duplicated.  

Our
sunscreen is a broad spectrum SPF 30 known as Skinbrella . We completed independent testing in early 2014 to validate our
broad spectrum sunscreen claims according to the labeling guidelines of the FDA, which are designed to help reduce the incidents
of skin cancer in the U.S. Our claims are as follows:  

Claim # 1  
Broad-Spectrum: According to the FDA, in order for a sunscreen to be labeled  broad spectrum  it must prove it protects
against both UVA and UVB rays by having an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 15 and a critical wave length of at least 370
nm. Our sunscreen has surpassed both of these criteria, allowing our broad spectrum sunscreen label to also state  prevents
sunburn, skin cancer and aging due to the sun.   

Claim # 2  
Water-Resistant 80 Minutes: The FDA sunscreen water resistant claim requires that a sunscreen must have the same SPF after being
in water or sweating for 40 or 80 minutes. Our testing was conducted at an independent laboratory specializing in sunscreen testing.
The test involved human subjects that applied sunscreen to their arm, followed by the immersion of the arm into a Jacuzzi for
80 minutes (10 minutes in / 10 minutes out). Our sunscreen successfully completed this testing and is allowed to use  Water-resistant
for 80 Minutes  on its sunscreen label, the longest length of time allowed by the FDA.  

Claim # 3  
Unique Patented Technology / Eight-Hour Photostability: As previously announced, we were granted a patent from the United States
Patent and Trademark Office entitled  Sunscreen Composition with Enhanced UVA Absorber Stability and Methods , which
provides protection until November 2029. Skinvisible successfully formulated a unique Invisicare  delivery system specifically
for stabilizing avobenzone; the key sunscreen used in the USA. Data submitted to the US patent office proved that our sunscreen
provides a minimum of eight hours of photostability.  

Our
Hand   Body Lotion is formulated with five moisturizers including aloe, shea butter, glycerin, coconut oil and jojoba oil,
and to help smooth your skin the powerful antioxidant Vitamin E. These ingredients restore and nourish your skin from head to
toe.  

Kintari
Canada Inc.    

Our
hand sanitizer formulated with Invisicare  and chlorhexidine gluconate has been launched in Canada by subsidiary Kintari Canada
Inc. where it has Health Canada approval. DermSafe is an alcohol free hand sanitizer that products against 99% of all germs. We
are currently seeking licensees and/or distributors to begin the sale of DermSafe in South America and in the EU. We launched
DermSafe in August, 2016 in Canada through our Kintari Canadian website for retail customers only.  

Table of Contents     

In
July, 2016, we announced that Kintari Canada made a donation of DermSafe to the Canadian Olympic Foundation offering protection
for Canada s athletes during the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio. Kintari Canada supplied the product to all Canadian Olympic
athletes, trainers and support staff.  

Capitalize
On Current Licensees   

We
have: Avon Products globally and Women s Choice Pharmaceuticals in the United States.  

We
continue to work diligently with our licensees to ensure they have a smooth manufacturing process, ongoing R D support and
marketing feedback.  

Avon
Products, Inc.    

Product :
We have a long-term contract with Avon globally for over ten years to provide Invisicare polymer for their long-lasting lipsticks.  

Sales:
 Invisicare polymers are purchased directly from Skinvisible.  

Women s
Choice Pharmaceuticals    

Product :
ProCort , long lasting prescription hemorrhoid cream launched in the United States August 2011.  

Sales
and Royalties : Skinvisible receives a royalty based on net sales of ProCort. This past year Women's Choice Pharmaceuticals
LLC partnered with Advanced Medical Enterprises, LLC to market ProCort  in Puerto Rico. With over thirty pharmaceutical sales
reps calling on OBGYNs in the US, Women s Choice has been successfully growing their sales of ProCort  and we look forward
to increased growth in 2016. Women s Choice is seeking to form other strategic alliances in order to increase its sales
efforts by targeting new territories and targeting medical specialists which previously were not called upon  

Additional
Skinvisible Products    

Sunless
Tanning Products   

We
have developed a new sunless tanning mousse / foam which uses a unique foam with Invisicare , developed specifically for its
foaming properties. This adds to Skinvisible s line of sunless tanning products which includes sunless tanning lotions (light,
medium and dark), pre-sun moisturizer and after-sun moisturizer along with sunless tanning spray products for commercial use.
The addition of a sunless tanning mousse enhances this line of products.  

Sunscreen
Products   

We
have developed 3 broad spectrum sunscreens, with SPF 15, 30 and 50 (the highest SPF allowed by the FDA). All are formulated with
Avobenzone, the only UVA sun filter allowed under the US FDA monograph. This UVA/UVB sunscreen was granted a patent from the United
States patent office in 2013. Avobenzone is known for breaking down in the sun after only two hours   thus the requirement
to reapply every 2 hours. Skinvisible s patent was granted based on Invisicare's  minimum 8 hour photo stability. For
countries outside the United States, Skinvisible has additionally patented UVA/UVB sunscreens formulated with Tinosorb S.  

Increasing
The Value of Skinvisible s Pipeline   

We
have a pipeline of over forty products which are available for licensing. Testing is conducted in-house generating proof of concept
including release of the active ingredient as well as long term shelf life (stability). Additional studies conducted on specific
products including skin sensitivity, toxicity and product efficacy are outsourced to FDA compliant laboratories. These studies
are critical in attracting potential licensees. Our clinical strategy is to:  

Table of Contents     

Our clinical
strategy is to find a partner for our prescription product portfolio. This would allow for a partner to seek FDA approval using
the 505b2 pathway for one or more of our products.  

Launch of our
DermSafe  hand sanitizer in Canada under Kintari. In 2013, we commissioned an independent laboratory to further analyze the
long-term effectiveness of DermSafe  when put in contact with two bacteria; the  super bug  MRSA and E. coli,
the  restaurant bug  since it is often transmitted by food and food handlers. The long-term effectiveness of two bacteria;
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA (ATCC #33591) and Escherichia coli or E. coli (ATCC #43888 ) were tested
up to four hours after application. The results showed that the individual arms of subjects which had DermSafe  applied and
were even rinsed prior to each bacteria challenge, showed a 95.83% reduction at the 4 hour time point for MRSA and 99.38% for
E. coli. In 2013, we obtained the registration rights for DermSafe  in Belgium. This designation allows for the sale and/
or registration of DermSafe in most EU countries. A strategy is being developed along with a larger global strategy to bring DermSafe
to the EU and. Skinvisible has also commissioned further testing of DermSafe against the (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV); a SARS-like virus and the avian influenza A virus, H7N9.  

We continue to
enhance our product developed for Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome is a disease caused by a genetic defect which causes
the skin to continually exfoliate, never forming a skin bond. This leaves the patient highly susceptible to infection and dealing
with a life-long condition that has no cure. Our product has shown excellent results in lab studies blocking the enzyme that breaks
down the skin and we are seeking  Orphan Drug  designation in both the US (FDA) and Europe (EMA). We continue to investigate
means to reformulate our product to better meet the demands of this very debilitating disease and are undergoing preliminary proof-of-concept
investigations on Netherton syndrome.  

The
                                         advantages of obtaining Orphan Drug designation is that it provides various incentives
                                         including a reduction or elimination of registration and market authorization fees, protocol
                                         assistance, and seven years of market exclusivity for the product in the US and ten years
                                         in Europe. There can be no assurances that our project will be successful. Research and
                                         development for this project is currently on hold as we determine additional options
                                         for our formulation.  

Secure
Additional Licensees   

We
are in discussions and undergoing internal discussions with various pharmaceutical companies for licenses.  

To
facilitate further expansion, we are seeking an exclusive license with a proven US or global based Pharmaceutical Company for
our existing Rx product formulations. The licensee would be expected to pay all costs in getting FDA approval. The licensee would
pay Skinvisible for the license in milestone payments as Clinical Phases are proven.  

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues    

Our
revenue from product sales, royalties on patent licenses and license fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $16,807,
a decrease from $30,377 for the same period ended September 30, 2015. Our revenue from product sales, royalties on patent licenses
and license fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $83,258, a decrease from $158,428 for the same period ended
September 30, 2015.  

The
decrease in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly due to a reduction in product sales. Our
initial foray into network marketing was the main reasons for the decrease in sales. Several distributors were not successful
in selling product and much of the product actually sold by these individuals was returned. Moreover, we ultimately terminated
several of these distributorships, which resulted in repurchasing product. We are currently in the process of revamping our network
marketing program, which we hope to establish for the last part of the year. We have also signed new distributors in the current
quarter.  

Table of Contents     

Cost
of Revenues    

Our
cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $32,583 from the prior year period when cost of revenues
was $9,859. Our cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $46,595 from the prior year period
when cost of revenues was $56,047. Our cost of revenues increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the prior
year period as a result of spoilage of expired product. Our cost of revenues decreased for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 over the prior year periods as a result of decreased product sales. We expect our cost of revenues to increase as we continue
to push sales from Kintari USA and Canada.  

Gross
Profit    

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was ($15,776), or approximately -94% of sales. Gross profit for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 was $20,518, or approximately 67% of sales. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $36,663, or approximately 44% of sales. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $102,381, or approximately
65% of sales. Our gross profit margin decreased in 2016 as compared with 2015, largely as a result of spoilage of product. If
we do not experience increased sales going forward, we will have a similar trend in product spoilage. Although there can be no
assurance, we are hopeful that our current licensing and marketing efforts will result in increased sales.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses decreased to $185,952 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $270,067 for the same period ended September
30, 2015. Operating expenses decreased to $725,251 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $943,982 for the same period
ended September 30, 2015.  

Our
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted mainly of accrued salaries and wages of $275,558, consulting
fees of $212,501, depreciation and amortization expenses of $43,334, rent of $32,359, accounting and audit expenses of $27,046
and salaries and wages of $20,333. In comparison, our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted
mainly of accrued salaries and wages of $238,950, salaries and wages of $153,828, commissions of $115,483, consulting fees of
$105,234, travel expenses of $64,875, depreciation and amortization expenses of $43,377, rent of $32,619, accounting and audit
expenses of $28,092, license and permit fees of $20,232 and payroll tax expense of $19,320.  

Other
Expenses    

We
had other expenses of $282,262 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with other expenses of $231,707 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Other expenses was the result of interest expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $232,107 in interest expenses from prior period ended September 30, 2015.  

We
had other expenses of $888,688 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with other expenses of $648,213 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was largely the result of $891,282 in interest expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from $650,079 in the prior period ended September 30, 2015.  

We
expect to continue to experience high interest payments in the future as a result of our outstanding liabilities. Moreover, as
of the date of this report, there are a number of secured promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately
$2,539,900 that have matured. In addition, we also have a number of unsecured promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount
of $61,476 that have matured. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or additional financing to service this debt,
there is a risk the lenders will call the notes, secure our assets, as to those applicable secured notes, and demand payment.
If this happens, we could go out of business.

September 30, 2015. Our net loss of $1,577,273 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, offset mainly by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $644,025, amortization of
debt discount of $428,347, an increase in accrued interest of $187,074 and stock based compensation of $133,445. Our net loss

increase of accrued interest of $149,788.  

Cash
flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $135,600, as compared with
$421,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of
$98,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable, $67,000 in proceeds from notes payable, $25,000 in proceeds from the sale
of our common stock and $18,700 in related party debt, offset by $47,500 in payments on convertible debt and $25,600 in payments

and $80,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, offset by $89,500 in payments on notes payable.  

On
August 11, 2016, we entered into a convertible promissory note pursuant to which we borrowed $15,000. Interest under the convertible
promissory note is 9% per annum, and the principal and all accrued but unpaid interest is due on August 11, 2018. The note is
convertible into shares of our common stock at a variable conversion price of 90% of the average market price of our common stock
during the 5 trading days prior to the notice of conversion, subject to adjustment as described in the note.  

On
August 31, 2016, we entered into a convertible promissory note pursuant to which we settled $50,000 in convertible notes and accrued
interest of $3,404. Interest under the convertible promissory note is 10% per annum, and the principal and all accrued but unpaid
interest is due on December 31, 2016. The note is convertible into 5,340,283 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.01 per
share and warrants to purchase 2,670,142 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.02 per share.  

On
October 11, 2016, we entered into a 10% unsecured note payable to an employee and received total proceeds of $5,070. The note
is due on December 31, 2016.  

On
October 31, 2016, 3,333,350 shares of our common stock and 1,666,675 warrants exercisable at $0.025 were issued for a cash investment
of $50,000.  

Based
upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next
twelve months. We intend to fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be
insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering
to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are
not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that
such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  

Going
concern    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred cumulative net losses
of $29,408,625 since our inception and require capital for our contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place.
Our ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional
financing, the successful development of our contemplated plan of operations, and our transition, ultimately, to the attainment
of profitable operations are necessary for us to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.  

Product
sales    Revenues from the sale of products (Invisicare  polymers) are recognized when title to the products are
transferred to the customer and only when no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby
have earned the right to receive reasonably assured payments for products sold and delivered.  

Royalty
sales    We also recognize royalty revenue from licensing our patented product formulations only when earned, with no
further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby have earned the right to receive and retain
reasonably assured payments.  

Distribution
and license rights sales    We also recognize revenue from distribution and license rights only when earned (and are
amortized over a five year period), with no further contingencies or material performance obligations are warranted, and thereby
have earned the right to receive and retain reasonably assured payments.  

Costs
of Revenue    Cost of revenue includes raw materials, component parts, and shipping supplies. Shipping and handling costs
is not a significant portion of the cost of revenue.  

Accounts
Receivable    Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms
requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for
collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management s best estimate
of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Management reviews each accounts receivable balance that exceeds 30 days
from the invoice date and, based on an assessment of creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that will
not be collected. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not recorded a reserve for doubtful accounts. The Company has $1,000,000
in convertible notes payable which are secured by the accounts receivable of a license agreement the Company has with Women's
Choice Pharmaceuticals, LLC on its proprietary prescription product, ProCort .

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
to conclude that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our
company plans to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period
covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To
remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016: (i) appoint
additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out are largely dependent
upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing
such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

into shares of our common stock at a variable conversion price of 90% of the average market price of our common stock during the
5 trading days prior to the notice of conversion, subject to adjustment as described in the note.

director fees not previously converted were converted to promissory notes convertible into common stock with a warrant feature.
The $3,600 face value promissory notes are unsecured, due five years from issuance, and bear an interest rate of 10%. At the investor s
option until the repayment date, the note may be converted to shares of our common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share along
with additional warrants to purchase one share for every two shares issued at the exercise price of $0.02 per share for three
years after the conversion date. We have determined the value associated with the beneficial conversion feature in connection
with the notes to be $1,571.  

On
October 20, 2016, we re-negotiated accrued salaries and interest and refinanced unsecured promissory notes for employees of the

into promissory notes convertible into common stock with a warrant feature. At the investor s option until the repayment
date, the note may be converted to shares of our common stock at a fixed price of $0.01 per share along with additional warrants
to purchase one share for every two shares issued at the exercise price of $0.02 per share for three years after the conversion
date.  

On

their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view towards distribution. The investors were given
adequate information about us to make an informed investment decision. We did not engage in any general solicitation or advertising.
