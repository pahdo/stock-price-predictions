1. Description of Business    

GENERAL   

Fellazo
Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 28, 2014 in the State of Nevada and established fiscal year end on August
31. We have recently started our operations. To the date August 31, 2016 our company possesses minimal assets, has generated limited
revenues from selling printed products to its customers and incurred losses since inception of $36,834. We specialize in billboard,
banner and large format printing.  

We
have purchased one cutting plotter and one digital printing machine from HARTLAND IMPEX LP, entered into one year Commercial Lease
Agreement, signed Sale Contract with two customers and receive revenues of $14,620.  

Our
activities were started from Chisinau, Moldova, where we have located our first cutting plotter.  

On
September 9, 2016, as a result of a private transaction, the control block of voting stock of the Company, represented by 3,000,000
shares of common stock (the  Shares ), has been transferred from Galina Hripenco to Wong Kong-Yew, and a change of
control of the Company occurred. Upon the change of control of the Company, which occurred on September 9, 2016, the existing
director and officer resigned immediately. Accordingly, Galina Hripenco, serving as the sole director and as the only officer,
ceased to be the Company s President and Principal Accounting Officer. At the effective date of the transfer, Wong Kong-Yew
consented to act as the new President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, Yap
Kit Chuan consented to act as the new Director of the Company, and Huang Minxi consented to act as the new Director of the Company.  

PRODUCT
OVERVIEW   

Fellazo
Corp offers following products:  

1.
Billboard printing, large format printing  

High
quality printing feature of our plotter and broadside printing capabilities enable us to produce billboard advertisements. Despite
advertising having been converted mostly to electronic banners, billboards still remain one of the main and efficient advertisement
types.  

2.
Printing and cutting thermal transfer films  

Thermal
transfer films with printed image or text on them are widely used in clothing industry. Our plotter is able to print images and/or
text on such film and cut it out, so that afterwards it can be applied to almost any other type of clothing.  

3.
Printing and cutting designer film  

Many
banners and light boxes are made using designer film with printed company name and logo. With help of our cutting plotter we can
cut logos and text from designer film, such as Oracal and Avery.  

4.
Production of car stickers  

Bumper
stickers, images or any other ornaments can be produced using our cutting plotter.  

CUTTING
PLOTTER   

We
have already purchased one cutting plotter BJ-67S for our operations from HARTLAND IMPEX LP. This equipment does not require any
special technical skills for manufacture process. Cutting plotter delivery set includes the plotter itself and supplies for testing.  

DIGITAL
PRINTING MACHINE   

As
of the date we have purchased one more unit of equipment from HARTLAND IMPEX LP. - Digital printing machine.  

RAW
MATERIALS   

We
plan to keep stock of following raw materials necessary for our operations:  

Outdoor
    billboard paper,    

Thermal
    transfer film,    

Oracle
    and Avery designer films,    

Vinyl
    water resistant paper,    

Printer
    ink.    

Other
kinds of materials for manufacture we may consider adding in the course of operations and can always order upon client s
request.  

POTENTIAL
CUSTOMERS   

Our
previous President and Director, Galina Hripcenco had put on market our printed product and negotiate with potential and existing
customers. We intend to develop and maintain client database with customers who may want to order our products. We will follow
up with our customers and offer them free samples and special discounts from time to time.  

Our
potential clients could be 1. Advertising agencies, 2. Sewing shops, 3. Car design studios, 4. Private clients.  

As
of August 31, 2016, Fellazo Corp. has entered into two sale contracts with two customers. The Company has generated limited revenues
of $14,620 from inception.  

STORAGE
AND DELIVERY   

The
raw materials and products produced by Fellazo Corp does not require any sprecial storage facilities, as it will be produced directly
for each order and stored on site. The number of demonstration samples to be kept is insignificant and does not require any special
premises for storage. We are going to sign a contract with local delivery company. As of August 31, 2016, we have not signed any
contracts with a delivery company yet.  

EMPLOYEES   

The
Company has recently started its operations and currently has no employees, other than our directors, who will initially perform
all work in production and organization of our business.  

COMPETITION   

The
industry we are entering is concentrated and competitive. Competitors will include companies with substantial customer bases and
working history. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors,
particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive
position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations.  

Some
of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows:  

1.
Increasing number of competitor: Other competitors may follow our business model of similar products manufacture, which will reduce
our competitive edge.  

2.
Price: Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell
our products at loss.  

3.
New technologies: Newer trends in advertising market, such as online advertising, new fashion and new technologies in clothing
manufacture, new materials used for car design instead of vinyl, etc., many of these factors may eventually have influence to
efficiency of our business model.  

MARKETING   

As
long as we have different kind of products to offer, our marketing campaign can involve many possible promotional activities.
First of all we plan to use our logo on all the products we make as a way to raise customer awareness.  

We
shall hand out our products, such as stickers and t-shirts with funny images at fairs and car shows. We plan to produce booklets
and flyers with company information. We will place our stands at advertising trade shows offering our services for outdoor advertising
on billboards, banners and light boxes.  

INSURANCE   

We
do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if
we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs
a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.  

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION   

We
will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our
business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact
on the way we conduct our business.

Item
5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters    

Market
Information   

Presently,
there is no public market for the common shares. There has been no trading in the Company s securities, and there has been
no bid or ask prices quoted. We cannot assure you that there will be a market for our common stock in the future.  

We
have issued 4,885,000 shares of our common stock since our inception on May 28, 2014. There are no outstanding options or warrants
or securities that are convertible into shares of common stock.  

Holders   

As
of August 31, 2016, we have 33 shareholders of record of our common stock.  

Transfer
Agent and Registrar   

The
transfer agent for our capital stock is Globex Transfer, LLC, with an address at 780 Deltona Blvd., Suite 202, Deltona, FL 32725
and telephone number is 813-344-4490.  

Penny
Stock Regulations   

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define  penny stock  to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within
the definition of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess
of $1,000,000, or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000, together with their spouse).  

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such
securities and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction,
other than exempt transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure
document mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose
the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and,
if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed
control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held
in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the  penny stock  rules may restrict
the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the
secondary market.  

In
addition to the  penny stock  rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a
broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending
speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain
information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for
at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy
our common stock, which may limit the investors  ability to buy and sell our stock.  

Dividends   

No
cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. We have not paid
any cash dividends since May 28, 2014 (inception) and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future.  

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities   

No
unregistered sales of equity securities took place during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016.  

Purchases
of Equity Securities by the Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers   

We
have not repurchased any shares of our common stock during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016.  

Other
Stockholder Matters   

None.  

Item
6. Selected Financial Data     

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide
the information under this item.  

Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.   

Certain
statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve
risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth

working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words  may,   will,   should,

 ongoing,   expects,   management believes,   we believe,   we intend, 
or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties,
there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Fellazo Corp., (the  Company ) as of August 31, 2016 and the related
statement of operation, change in stockholders  deficit, and cash flow for the year then ended. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fellazo
Corp as of August 31, 2016 and the results of their operations, and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has recurring losses and has not generated a stable source of revenues from
its planned principal operations. These factors raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We

deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended. Fellazo Corp s management is responsible for these financial statements.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial

The
accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that Fellazo Corp. will continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its successful execution of its
plan of operations and ability to raise additional financing. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional
capital or sell any of its products or services at a profit. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
a working capital deficit of $4,395 and has not established a stable source of revenue sufficient to cover operating cost for
the next year. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty

NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

Fellazo
Corp. ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada
on May 28, 2014. We are in the business of production and distribution of billboard banners, designer film advertisements, vinyl
car ornaments and thermal transfer images. Our products are sold in Moldova.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. At August 31, 2016 ,  the Company has a working
capital deficit of $21,957 and has not yet established a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating cost for the
foreseeable future. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.  

The
Company s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash from operating activities
and obtain additional financing. Although we can provide no assurances, we believe our cash on hand, coupled with revenues generated
by sales and our ability to raise fund through issuance of our equity will provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources
to fund our business for the next twelve months.  

In
the event the Company experiences liquidity and capital resource constraints because of unanticipated operating losses, we may
need to raise additional capital in the form of equity and/or debt financing. If such additional capital is not available on terms
acceptable to us or at all, then we may need to curtail our operations and/or take additional measures to conserve and manage
our liquidity and capital resources, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
and our ability to continue in existence. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.  

NOTE
3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
significant accounting policies followed by the Company from interim reporting are consisted with those included in the Company s
annual report financials annual report from SEC for the year end August 31, because there were no substantial changes to our significant
accountant policies during the period ended August 31, 2016.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America. The Company s year-end is August 31.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ASC topic 605  Revenue Recognition . The Company recognizes revenue
when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, prices are fixed or determinable, products are fully delivered and collection
is reasonably assured.  

Fair
Value Of Financial Instruments   

AS
topic 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes
the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs
used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  

These
tiers include:  

Level
1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

Level
2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  

Level
3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

The
carrying value of cash and the Company s loan from shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.  

Inventories

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. At August
31, 2016 the Company s inventory consisted of raw materials.  

Equipment

The
Company s equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and
replacements that increase the property s useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related
accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.  

Income
Taxes   

We
use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes. 
Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s
financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available
positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

ASC
Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions
for any of the reporting periods presented.  

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share    

The
Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260  Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the period ended
May 28, 2014 (inception) to August 31, 2014 and for the year ended August 31, 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or
equity instruments issued or outstanding.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.  

NOTE
4  EQUIPMENT   

A
summary of equipment and estimated lives used in the computation of depreciation is as follows:  

NOTE
5   LOAN FROM DIRECTOR   

As
of August 31, 2016 and 2015, our previous director has loaned to the Company $28,204 and $4,129, respectively. For the year ended
August 31, 2016, the loan proceeds from our previous director was amount to $24,075. This loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing
and due on demand. The loan has been waived by our previous director upon change of control on September 9, 2016.  

NOTE
6   STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY   

On
July 2, 2015, the Company offered and sold 3,000,000 restricted shares of common stock to our president and director, Hripcenco
Galina, for a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate offering proceeds of $3,000.  

During
March 2016, the company issued a total of 275,000 common shares for cash contribution of $2,750 at $0.01 per share.  

During
April 2016, the company issued a total of 1,545,000 common shares for cash contribution of $15,450 at $0.01 per share.  

During
May 2016, the company issued a total of 65,000 common shares for cash contribution of $650 at $0.01 per share.  

NOTE
7   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

In
June of 2015, the Company entered into a one year lease agreement that calls for monthly rental payments of $260. The lease became
effective as of August 1, 2015. Total rent paid was $3,120 for the year ended August 31 ,  2016 ,  which is being amortized
over the life of the lease. Upon change of control on September 9, 2016, the lease has been terminated. The new business premise
is provided by our current director for rent-free.  

NOTE
8   INCOME TAXES   

The
Company s income tax benefit differs from the expected income tax benefit by applying the U.S. Federal statutory rate of
34% to net income (loss) as follows:  

Deferred
tax assets consist of:  

As
of August 31, 2016 the Company had approximately $36,834 of federal and state net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs ),
which begin to expire in 2034. The NOLS may be subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 should be a greater
than 50% ownership change as determined under regulations. On September 9, 2016, there is a change in control of the Company.
The section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with
pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses. The limitation imposed by section 382 for any post-change
year would be determined by multiplying the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments)
by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, which is 2.08% for September 2016.  

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based
on the assessment, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets for every period
because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

The
Company does not currently have any ongoing tax examinations.  

NOTE
9   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 855,  Subsequent Events , which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all events
or transactions that occurred after August 31, 2016 up through the date the Company issued the audited financial statements.  

On
September 9, 2016, as a result of a private transaction, the control block of voting stock of the Company, represented by 3,000,000
shares of common stock (the  Shares ), has been transferred from Galina Hripenco to Wong Kong-Yew, and a change of
control of the Company occurred. Upon the change of control of the Company, which occurred on September 9, 2016, the existing
director and officer resigned immediately. Accordingly, Galina Hripenco, serving as the sole director and as the only officer,
ceased to be the Company s President and Principal Accounting Officer. At the effective date of the transfer, Wong Kong-Yew
consented to act as the new President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, Yap
Kit Chuan consented to act as the new Director of the Company, and Huang Minxi consented to act as the new Director of the Company.  

Item
9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure    

(a)    Resignation
                                         of Previous Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    

On
October 19, 2016, Fellazo Corp. (the  Company ) dismissed Paritz   Company, P.A ( Partiz ) as the
independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, effective immediately. The dismissal of Partiz was approved by the
Company s Board of Directors.  

The
audit reports of Partiz on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for each of the two most recent fiscal years ended
August 31, 2015 and August 31, 2014 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that its report contained a going concern qualification as to
the Company s ability to continue.  

During
the Company s two most recent fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and August 31, 2014 and during the subsequent interim period
through May 31, 2016, there were no disagreements between the Company and Partiz on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Partiz, would have
caused Partiz to make reference to the matter in reports on the Company s financial statements, had any such reports been
issued. During the period of engagement, there were no  reportable events  as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv)
of Regulation S-K.  

The
Registrant has provided Partiz with a copy of the disclosures in this Current Report and the Company requested a letter from Partiz
addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of that letter
is attached as an exhibit to this Current Report.  

(b)    Engagement
                                         of New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    

On
October 19, 2016, concurrent with the dismissal of Partiz, the Company, upon the Board of Directors  approval, engaged Malone
Bailey LLP ( Malone ) as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.  

During
the Company s two most recent fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and August 31, 2014 and during the subsequent interim period
through May 31, 2016, the Company did not consult Malone with respect to (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s consolidated
financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was provided that Malone concluded
was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting
issue; or (b) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a
reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.  

Item
9A (T). Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on the
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls
over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective.  

Identified
Material Weaknesses  

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies,
that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or
detected.  

Management
identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of August
31, 2016.  

1.  
      We
    do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s
    view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s
    financial statement. Currently the Chief Executive Officer and Director act in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does
    not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s
    activities.   

2.  
      We
    do not have Written Policies   Procedures   Due to lack of written policies and procedures for accounting and financial
    reporting, the Company did not establish a formal process to close our books monthly and account for all transactions. There
    is also an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as a result of the lack of written policies
    and procedures.    

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls.  

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our third fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the
director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors
has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of
directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though
such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board
of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s
business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.
