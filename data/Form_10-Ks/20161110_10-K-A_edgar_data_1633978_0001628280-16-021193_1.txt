Explanatory Note to Amendment No.1 
  Lumentum Holdings Inc. (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this  Amendment No.1 ) to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2016, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on September 2, 2016 (the  Original Filing ), solely for the purposes of amending (i) Part II, Item 9A to revise the disclosure to include the conclusion that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July 2, 2016 and to include management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting, and (ii) Part IV, Item 15 to add the references in Section 3 to documents included in the Original Filing and to include as exhibits the new certifications required by Rule 13a-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).  
  Prior to the Original Filing, management performed and completed its assessment of Lumentum s internal control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2016.  However, due to an administrative error, Item 9A(b) in the Original Filing inadvertently repeated the language from the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015, our first Annual report on Form 10-K, and did not include the updated disclosure consisting of management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting.  As a result, the disclosure required under Regulation S-K Item 308 and certain clauses in the certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were inadvertently omitted from the Original Filing  This Amendment No. 1 is being filed to provide this omitted disclosure and correct these certifications.  
  In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the Exchange Act, Part II, Item 9A and Part IV, Item 15 of the Original Filing have been amended and restated in their entirety.  This Amendment No. 1 does not amend or otherwise update any other information in the Original Filing.  Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing.

PART II 
  ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  (a)   EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the  Evaluation Date ).   
  The purpose of this evaluation is to determine if, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective such that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   
  As noted below, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on the criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) (the  2013 Framework ) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the Evaluation Date.  However, due to an administrative error, Item 9A(b) in the Original Filing inadvertently repeated the language from the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by us for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015, our first Annual report on Form 10-K, and did not include the updated disclosure consisting of management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting.  As a result, the disclosure required under Regulation S-K Item 308 and certain clauses in the certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were inadvertently omitted.  As a result of this administrative error, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the Evaluation Date. 
  The Company has implemented additional pre-filing review controls, including additional form check processes, effective immediately, to ensure the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in future periods.    
  (b)   MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the 2013 Framework. Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 2, 2016.   This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting due to an exemption established by the JOBS Act for  emerging growth companies.  
   (c)   CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  (d)   INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS 
  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognizes that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting cannot prevent or detect all possible instances of errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.

  1. Financial Statements 
  The financial statements filed as part of the Original Filing are listed in the "Index to Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of the Original Filing.
