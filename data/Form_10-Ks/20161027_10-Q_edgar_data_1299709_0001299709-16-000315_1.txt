1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
       
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BofI Holding, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, BofI Federal Bank (the  Bank  and collectively with BofI Holding, Inc., the  Company ).  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements, presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), are unaudited and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods. All adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.  Results for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the year as a whole. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )     with respect to interim financial reporting.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended   June 30, 2016   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  On November 17, 2015, the Company completed a four-for-one forward stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this four-for-one stock split. In November, the number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance was increased from 50,000,000 to 150,000,000 as approved by the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders.  
   
           2. 
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     Securities  .   Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has both the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Trading securities refer to certain types of assets that banks hold for resale at a profit or when the Company elects to account for certain securities at fair value. Increases or decreases in the fair value of trading securities are recognized in earnings as they occur. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company elected to reclassify all of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale. See Note 4    Securities  for further information.  
  Gains and losses on securities sales are based on a comparison of sales proceeds and the amortized cost of the security sold using the specific identification method.  Purchases and sales are recognized on the trade date.  Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized or accreted using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. The Company s portfolios of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. In performing this review, management considers (1) the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) the impact of changes in market interest rates on the market value of the security and (4) how to record an impairment by assessing whether the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position before the Company recovers the security s amortized cost. If either of these criteria for (4) is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in earnings. Alternatively, if the criteria for (4) is not met, the amount of impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the amount related to credit losses, while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. 
  Loans and Leases  . Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned interest, deferred purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan origination fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Premiums and discounts on loans purchased as well as loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method.

The Company provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lease arrangements. The most common arrangement is a direct financing (capital) lease. For direct financing leases, lease receivables are recorded on the balance sheet but the leased property is not, although the Company generally retains legal title to the leased property until the end of each lease. Direct financing leases are stated at the net amount of minimum lease payments receivable, plus any unguaranteed residual value, less the amount of unearned income and net acquisition discount at the reporting date. Direct lease origination costs are amortized over the weighted average life of the lease portfolio. Leases acquired in an acquisition are initially measured and recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date. Purchase discounts or premiums on acquired leases are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the leases using the effective interest method or taken into income when the related leases are paid off. Direct financing leases are subject to our allowance for loans and leases. 
  Recognition of interest income on all portfolio segments is generally discontinued at the time the loan or lease is 90 days delinquent unless the loan or lease is well secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan or lease. In all cases, loans or leases are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 
  All interest accrued but not received for loans or leases placed on nonaccrual, is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans or leases is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans and leases are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
  Loans Held for Sale.   U.S government agency ( agency ) loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at fair value. Net unrealized gains and losses are recognized through the income statement. The Bank sells its mortgage loans with either servicing released or servicing retained depending upon market pricing. Gains and losses on loan sales are recorded as mortgage banking income, based on the difference between sales proceeds and carrying value. Non-agency loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. 
  Loans that were originated with the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future (loans held in portfolio) but which have been subsequently designated as being held for sale for risk management or liquidity needs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value calculated on an individual loan by loan basis. 
  There may be times when loans have been classified as held for sale and for some reason cannot be sold. Loans transferred to a long-term-investment classification from held-for-sale are transferred at the lower of cost or market value on the transfer date. Any difference between the carrying amount of the loan and its outstanding principal balance is recognized as an adjustment to yield by the interest method. A loan cannot be classified as a long-term investment unless the Bank has both the ability and the intent to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until maturity.  
  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.   The allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level estimated to provide for probable incurred losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on reviews of individual loans and leases and pools of loans, recent loss experience, current economic conditions, the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses, which is charged against current period operating results and recoveries of loans previously charged-off. The allowance is decreased by the amount of charge-offs of loans deemed uncollectible. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. See Note 5 of these financial statement footnotes and the financial statement footnotes for the year ended   June 30, 2016   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 
    
  Brand Partnership Products.   The Bank has agreements with H R Block, Inc. ( H R Block ) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries that allow the Bank to provide H R Block-branded financial services products and services. The products and services that represent the primary focus and the majority of transactional volume that the Bank processes are described in detail below.  
  The first product is Emerald Prepaid MasterCard  services. The Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in August 2015. Under the agreements, the Bank is responsible for the primary oversight and control of the prepaid card programs of a wholly owned subsidiary of H R Block. The Bank holds the prepaid card customer deposits for those cards issued under the prepaid programs in non-interest bearing accounts and earns a fixed fee paid by H R Block s subsidiary for each automated clearing house ( ACH ) transaction processed through the prepaid card customer accounts. A portion of H R Block s customers use the Emerald Card as an option to receive federal and state income tax refunds. The prepaid customer deposits are included in non-interest bearing deposit liabilities on the balance sheet of the Company and the ACH fee income is included in the income statement under the line banking service fees and other income.

The second product is Refund Transfer. The Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in August 2015. The Bank is responsible for the primary oversight and control of the refund transfer program of a wholly owned subsidiary of H R Block. The Bank opens a temporary bank account for each H R Block customer who is receiving an income tax refund and elects to defer payment of his or her tax preparations fees. After the Internal Revenue Service and any state income tax authorities transfer the refund into the customer s account, the net funds are transferred to the customer and the temporary deposit account is closed. The Bank earns a fixed fee paid by H R Block for each of the H R Block customers electing a Refund Transfer. The fees are earned primarily in the quarters ending March 31   st    and are included in the income statement under the line banking service fees and other income. 
  The third product is Emerald Advance. The Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in August 2015. Under the agreements the Bank is responsible for the underwriting guidelines and credit policies for unsecured consumer lines of credit offered to H R Block customers. The Bank offers and funds unsecured lines of credit to consumers primarily through the H R Block tax preparation offices and earns interest income and fee income. The Bank retains   10%   of the Emerald Advance and sells the remainder to H R Block. The lines of credit are included in loans and leases on the balance sheet of the Company and the interest income and fee income are included in the income statement under the line loans and leases interest and dividend income. 
  The fourth product is an Individual Retirement Account ( IRA ). The Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in August 2015, but the initial offering of this product through H R Block offices is planned for the upcoming tax season. The Bank is responsible for the primary oversight and control of the IRA product. During a tax preparation session with an H R Block tax preparer, the customer is given an option to open a traditional IRA or Roth IRA savings account with the Bank. If the customer elects the option to open an account and meets the Bank s requirements, an account is opened on the Bank s core operating system under the Bank s oversight and control. The customer has the option to deposit funds for the IRA through check or ACH. The Bank provides IRA custodial services, earns a nominal fee paid by the customers for any accounts closures or transfers out, and pays customers interest based on their IRA balance. The fees are included in the income statement under the line banking service fees and other income and interest paid is included under the line deposit interest expense. 
  The fifth product is an interest-free Refund Advance loan. The Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in October 2016. Under the agreements the Bank will perform disbursement and repayment services and provide funding for interest-free Refund Advance loans to H R Block customers. The Bank, in conjunction with its agreement partners, offers and funds interest-free loans to consumers, secured by the consumer s tax refund receivable, primarily through the H R Block tax preparation offices and earns interest income and fee income. The average life of the Refund Advance loan is expected to be ten days. The Bank retains the Refund Advance loans that it funds and will be included in loans and leases on the balance sheet of the Company and the interest income and fee income will be included in the income statement under the line loans and leases interest and dividend income. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements.   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03 Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Under the amended guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are required to be presented as deductions from the carrying amounts of the corresponding debt liabilities, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts and premiums. The amended guidance was adopted for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and applied retrospectively in accordance with the amended guidance, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented has been adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the amended guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ), which (i) significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model; and (ii) provides for recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities through an allowance account. ASU 2016-13 also requires certain incremental disclosures. ASU 2016-13 should be applied on a modified-retrospective transition approach that would require a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the statement of financial condition as of the date of adoption. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The guidance will be effective for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning July 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted beginning July 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU and the Company expects ASU 2016-13 to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

    FAIR VALUE 
       
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for   identical   assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities that are actively traded in an exchange or over-the-counter market and are highly liquid, such as, among other assets and securities, certain U.S. treasury and other U.S. government debt. 
              Level 2: 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for   similar   assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets include securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
              Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models such as discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
     When available, the Company generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value, in which case the items are classified in Level 1. In some cases where a market price is available, the Company will make use of acceptable practical expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case the items are classified in Level 2. 
  The Company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible. The frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and the nature of the participants are some of the factors the Company uses to help determine whether a market is active and orderly or inactive and not orderly. Price quotes based upon transactions that are not orderly are not considered to be determinative of fair value and should be given little, if any, weight in measuring fair value. 
  If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, credit spreads, housing value forecasts, etc. Items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. 
  The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified: 
  Securities trading.   Trading securities are recorded at fair value. The trading portfolio consists of   two   different issues of floating-rate debt securities collateralized by pools of bank trust preferred securities. Recent liquidity and economic uncertainty have made the market for collateralized debt obligations less active or inactive. As quoted market prices are not available, the Level 3 fair values for these securities are determined by the Company utilizing industry-standard tools to calculate the net present value of the expected cash flows available to the securities from the underlying assets. The Company s expected cash flows are calculated for each security and include the impact of actual and forecasted bank defaults within each collateral pool as well as structural features of the security s tranche such as lock outs, subordination and overcollateralization. The forecast of underlying bank defaults in each pool is based upon a quarterly financial update including the trend in non-performing assets, the allowance for loan and lease losses and the underlying bank s capital ratios. Also a factor is the Company s loan and lease loss experience in the local economy in which the bank operates. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s forecast of cash flows for both securities includes actual and forecasted defaults totaling   16.5%   of all banks in the collateral pools, compared to   15.4%   of the banks actually in default. The expected cash flows reflect the Company s best estimate of all pool losses which are then applied to the overcollateralization reserve and the subordinated tranches to determine the cash flows. The Company selects a discount rate margin based upon the spread between U.S. Treasury rates and the market rates for active credit grades for financial companies. The discount margin when added to the U.S. Treasury rate determines the discount rate, reflecting primarily market liquidity and interest rate risk since expected credit loss is included in the cash flows. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company used a weighted average discount margin of   475   basis points above   U.S. Treasury   rates to calculate the net present value of the expected cash flows and the fair value of its trading securities.

     Table of Contents  

The Level 3 fair values determined by the Company for its trading securities rely heavily on management s assumptions as to the future credit performance of the collateral banks, the impact of the global and regional economic activity, the timing of forecasted defaults and the discount rate applied to cash flows. The fair value of the trading securities at   September 30, 2016   is sensitive to an increase or decrease in the discount rate. An increase in the discount margin of   100   basis points would have reduced the total fair value of the trading securities and decreased net income before income tax by   $882  . A decrease in the discount margin of   100   basis points would have increased the total fair value of the trading securities and increased net income before income tax by   $1,032  . 
  Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity  .   Available-for-sale ( AFS ) securities are recorded at fair value and consist of residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ) issued by U.S. agencies, non-agencies, collateralized loan obligations, and municipals. Held-to-maturity ( HTM ) securities are recorded at amortized cost and consist of RMBS issued by U.S. agencies, RMBS issued by non-agencies, and municipals. Fair value for U.S. agency securities is generally based on quoted market prices of similar securities used to form a dealer quote or a pricing matrix. There continues to be significant illiquidity in the market for RMBS issued by non-agencies, impacting the availability and reliability of transparent pricing. As orderly quoted market prices are not available, the Level 3 fair values for these securities are determined by the Company utilizing industry-standard tools to calculate the net present value of the expected cash flows available to the securities from the underlying mortgage assets. The Company computes Level 3 fair values for each non-agency RMBS in the same manner (as described below) whether available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. 
  To determine the performance of the underlying mortgage loan pools, the Company estimates prepayments, defaults, and loss severities based on a number of macroeconomic factors, including housing price changes, unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower attributes such as credit score and loan documentation at the time of origination. For each security, the Company inputs a projection of monthly default rates, loss severity rates and voluntary prepayment rates for the underlying mortgages for the remaining life of each security to determine the expected cash flows. The projections of default rates are derived by the Company from the historic default rate observed in the pool of loans collateralizing the security, increased by and decreased by the forecasted increase or decrease in the national unemployment rate. The projections of loss severity rates are derived by the Company from the historic loss severity rate observed in the pool of loans, increased by (and decreased by) the forecasted decrease or increase in the national home price appreciation ( HPA ) index. The largest factors influencing the Company s modeling of the monthly default rate are unemployment and HPA, as a strong correlation exists. The national unemployment rate announced prior to the end of the period covered by this report (reported for August 2016) was   4.9%  , down from the high of   10.0%   in October 2009. Consensus estimates for unemployment are that the rate will continue to decline.  Going forward, the Company is projecting lower monthly default rates.  The range of loss severity rates applied to each default used in the Company s projections at   September 30, 2016   are from   40.0%   up to   68.7%   based upon individual bond historical performance. The default rates and the severities are projected for every non-agency RMBS security held by the Company and will vary monthly based upon the actual performance of the security and the macroeconomic factors discussed above. 
  To determine the discount rates used to compute the present value of the expected cash flows for these non-agency RMBS securities, the Company separates the securities by the borrower characteristics in the underlying pool. Specifically,  prime  securities generally have borrowers with higher FICO scores and better documentation of income.  Alt-A  securities generally have borrowers with a lower FICO and less documentation of income.  Pay-option ARMs  are Alt-A securities with borrowers that tend to pay the least amount of principal (or increase their loan balance through negative amortization). The Company calculates separate discount rates for prime, Alt-A and Pay-option ARM non-agency RMBS securities using market-participant assumptions for risk, capital and return on equity. The range of annual default rates used in the Company s projections at   September 30, 2016   are from   1.5%   up to   20.9%   with prime securities tending toward the lower end of the range and Alt-A and Pay-option ARMs tending toward the higher end of the range. The Company applies its discount rates to the projected monthly cash flows which already reflect the full impact of all forecasted losses using the assumptions described above. When calculating present value of the expected cash flows at   September 30, 2016  , the Company computed its discount rates as a spread between   243   and   667   basis points over the interpolated swap curve with prime securities tending toward the lower end of the range and Alt-A and Pay-option ARMs tending toward the higher end of the range. 
  The Bank s estimate of fair value for non-agency securities using Level 3 pricing is highly subjective and is based on the Bank s estimate of voluntary prepayments, default rates, severities and discount margins, which are forecasted monthly over the remaining life of the security. Changes in one or more of these assumptions can cause a significant change in the estimated fair value. For further details see the table later in this note that summarizes quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements.  
  Loans Held for Sale.   Loans held for sale at fair value are primarily single-family and multifamily residential loans.  The fair value of residential loans held for sale is determined by pricing for comparable assets or by existing forward sales commitment prices with investors.

Impaired Loans.   Impaired loans are loans which are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrowers or the collateral pledged. The accrual of interest income has been discontinued for impaired loans.  The impaired loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  The Company assesses loans individually and identifies impairment when the loan is classified as impaired, has been restructured, or management has serious doubts about the future collectibility of principal and interest, even though the loans may currently be performing. The fair value of an impaired loan is determined based on an observable market price or current appraised value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of impaired loans with specific write-offs or allocations of the allowance for loan losses are generally based on recent real estate appraisals or internal valuation analyses consistent with the methodology used in real estate appraisals and include other third-party valuations and analysis of cash flows. These appraisals and analyses are updated at least on an annual basis. The Company primarily obtains real estate appraisals and in the rare cases where an appraisal cannot be obtained, the Company performs an internal valuation analysis. These appraisals and analyses may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and income approaches. The sales comparison approach uses at least three recent similar property sales to help determine the fair value of the property being appraised. The income approach is calculated by taking the net operating income generated by the collateral property of the rent collected and dividing it by an assumed capitalization rate. Adjustments are routinely made in the process by the appraisers to account for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. When measuring the fair value of the impaired loan based upon the projected sale of the underlying collateral, the Company subtracts the costs expected to be incurred for the transfer of the underlying collateral, which includes items such as sales commissions, delinquent taxes and insurance premiums. These adjustments to the estimated fair value of non-performing loans may result in increases or decreases to the provision for loan losses recorded in current earnings.  Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification for the inputs for determining fair value. 
  Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Vehicles  . Non-recurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned ( OREO ) are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third-party appraisals of the property, resulting in a Level 3 classification. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. 
  Mortgage Servicing Rights.   The Company initially records all mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) at fair value and accounts for MSRs at fair value during the life of the MSR, with changes in fair value recorded through current period earnings. Fair value adjustments encompass market-driven valuation changes as well as modeled amortization involving the run-off of value that occurs due to the passage of time as individual loans are paid by borrowers. Market expectations about loan duration, and correspondingly the expected term of future servicing cash flows, may vary from time to time due to changes in expected prepayment activity, especially when interest rates rise or fall. Market expectations of increased loan prepayment speeds may negatively impact the fair value of the single family MSRs. Fair value is also dependent on the discount rate used in calculating present value, which is imputed from observable market activity and market participants and results in Level 3 classification. Management reviews and adjusts the discount rate on an ongoing basis. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the estimated fair value of the MSRs asset. 
  Mortgage Banking Derivatives.   Fair value for mortgage banking derivatives are either based upon prices in active secondary markets for identical securities or based on quoted market prices of similar assets used to form a dealer quote or a pricing matrix.  If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a commitment is determined by quoted prices for a similar commitment or commitments, adjusted for the specific attributes of each commitment.  These fair values are then adjusted for items such as fallout and estimated costs to originate the loan. 
    
  The Company s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  While management believes the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with or, in some cases, more conservative than other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the relevant reporting date.

The table below summarizes the quantitative information about level 3 fair value measurements at the periods indicated: 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s residential mortgage-backed securities are prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity in the event of default.  Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.  Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates.

The table below summarizes assets measured for impairment on a non-recurring basis: 

Impaired loans measured for impairment on a non-recurring basis using the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans have a carrying amount of   $42,239  , after charge-offs of   $96   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and life to date charge-offs of   $5,009  . Impaired loans had a related allowance of   $1,244   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other real estate owned and foreclosed assets, which are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, had a net carrying amount of   $1,370   after charge-offs of   $113   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Held-to-maturity securities measured for impairment on a non-recurring basis had   no   fair value and   no   carrying amount at   September 30, 2016  , with   no   net impairment charges to income and   no   changes to other comprehensive income during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company recognized net impairment charges to income of   $83   and an increase in other

comprehensive increase of   $2,531   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These held-to-maturity securities are valued using Level 3 inputs. 
  The Company has elected the fair value option for Agency loans held for sale. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes that the fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans. Interest income is recorded based on the contractual terms of the loan. None of these loans are   90 days   or more past due nor on nonaccrual as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , the aggregate fair value, contractual balance (including accrued interest), and unrealized gain was as follows:

Fair value of Financial Instruments  
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair value are described as follows: Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits, short-term debt, and variable rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully. For fixed rate loans, deposits, borrowings or subordinated debt and for variable rate loans, deposits, borrowings or subordinated debt with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. A discussion of the methods of valuing trading securities, available for sale securities and loans held for sale can be found earlier in this footnote. The carrying amount of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) approximates the estimated fair value of this investment. The fair value of off-balance sheet items is not considered material.

  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company elected to reclassify all of its HTM securities to AFS. While the Company has the ability to hold those transferred securities to maturity and as of September 30, 2016 does not intend to sell the securities, the Company concluded that there are now sufficient uncertainties associated with i) future fiscal and monetary policy resulting from domestic and international political changes, ii) future interpretations and applications of new accounting principles and regulatory guidance; iii) the pace of future market interest rate increases given that market interest rates remain at historical lows, all of which could, depending upon the outcomes, change the Company s intent to hold its securities. Under Accounting Standards Codification 320-10 Investments Debt Securities, there are very limited exceptions that allow an entity to reclassify or sell one or more securities from HTM  
  
    19 

     Table of Contents  

and still use the HTM classification for any remaining securities. The Company concluded that such exceptions may not apply to all results and elected to reclassify all HTM securities to AFS understanding that such reclassification will immediately eliminate the Company s ability to use the HTM classification for its securities portfolio for a period of time not to be less than   one year  . The Company will perform periodic assessments in the future to determine whether the above referenced uncertainties have been resolved and that management has the positive intent and ability to hold securities until maturity. The net carrying amount of the securities reclassified in September 2016 from HTM to AFS was   $194,153   and the fair value of AFS securities at September 30, 2016 is reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The reclassification resulted in an unrealized gain recognized through other comprehensive income of   $3,618   in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
    
  The Company s non-agency RMBS available-for-sale portfolio with a total fair value of   $133,169   at   September 30, 2016   consists of   seventy-three   different issues of super senior securities with a fair value of   $130,490  ,   two   mezzanine z-tranche securities, negative-amortizing support tranches, with a fair value of   $36   collateralized by seasoned prime and Alt-A first-lien mortgages and   one   senior support security that it acquired at a significant discount that evidenced credit deterioration at acquisition, with a fair value of   $2,643  . The Company acquired its mezzanine z-tranche securities in fiscal 2010 and accounts for them by measuring the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the purchase price (accretable yield) and recognizes interest income over the remaining life of the security.  
    
  Debt securities with evidence of credit quality deterioration since issuance and for which it is probable at purchase that the Company will be unable to collect all of the par value of the security are accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality ( ASC Topic 310-30 ). Under ASC Topic 310-30, the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the purchase price is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the security. The Company has   one   senior support security that it acquired at a significant discount that evidenced credit deterioration at acquisition and is accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30. For a cost of   $17,740   the Company acquired the senior support security with a contractual par value of   $30,560   and accretable and non-accretable discounts that were projected to be   $9,015   and   $3,805  , respectively. Since acquisition, repayments from the security have been received more rapidly than projected at acquisition, but expected total payments have declined, resulting in a determination that the security was other-than-temporarily impaired. The security had   no   other-than temporary loss for   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   no   charge was recorded for the fiscal   2016   year. At   September 30, 2016   the security had a remaining contractual par value of   zero   dollars and amortizable and non-amortizable premium are currently projected to be   zero   dollars and   $2,472  , respectively. 
  The current face amounts of debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity that were pledged to secure borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were   $24,310   and   $39,961   respectively.

The following table summarizes amounts of credit loss recognized in the income statement through other-than-temporary impairment charges which reduced non-interest income: 

At   September 30, 2016  , non-agency RMBS with a total carrying amount of   $90,427   were determined to have cumulative credit losses of   $20,611   of which   $120   was recognized in earnings during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This quarter s other-than-temporary impairment of   $120   is related to   two   non-agency RMBS with a total carrying amount of   $3,959  . The Company measures its non-agency RMBS in an unrecognized loss position at the end of the reporting period for other-than-temporary impairment by comparing the present value of the cash flows currently expected to be collected from the security with its amortized cost basis. If the calculated present value is lower than the amortized cost, the difference is the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of its debt securities. The excess of present value over the fair value of the security (if any) is the non-credit component only if the Company does not intend to sell the security and will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment is recorded as a loss in earnings and the non-credit component as a charge to other comprehensive income, net of the related income tax benefit. 
  To determine the cash flow expected to be collected and to calculate the present value for purposes of testing for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company utilizes the same industry-standard tool and the same cash flows as those calculated for Level 3 fair values as discussed in Note 3   Fair Value. The discount rates used to compute the present value of the expected cash flows for purposes of testing for the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment are either the implicit rate calculated in each of the Company s securities at acquisition or the last accounting yield. The Company calculates the implicit rate at acquisition based on the contractual terms of the security, considering scheduled payments (and minimum payments in the case of pay-option ARMs) without prepayment assumptions. Once the discount rate (or discount margin in the case of floating rate securities) is calculated as described above, the discount is used in the industry-standard model to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
  The gross gains and losses realized through earnings upon the sale of available-for-sale securities for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

     LOANS, LEASES   ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES 
     The following table sets forth the composition of the loan and lease portfolio as of the dates indicated: 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.   We are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan and lease losses (sometimes referred to as the  allowance ) at a level that is considered to be commensurate with estimated probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Although the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly, management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the portfolio. While the Company believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate at   September 30, 2016  , future additions to the allowance will be subject to continuing evaluation of estimated and known, as well as inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio. 
  Allowance for Loan and Lease Loss Disclosures.   The assessment of the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan and lease losses is based upon a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including levels and trends of past due and nonaccrual loans and leases, change in volume and mix of loans and leases, collateral values and charge-off history. 
  The Company provides general loan loss reserves for its automobile ( auto ) and recreational vehicle ( RV ) loans based upon the borrower credit score and the Company s loss experience to date. The allowance for loan loss for the auto and RV loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was determined by classifying each outstanding loan according to semi-annually refreshed FICO score and providing loss rates. The Company had   $93,455   of auto and RV loan balances subject to general reserves as follows: FICO greater than or equal to 770:   $35,960  ; 715   769:   $33,871  ; 700   714:   $10,182  ; 660   699:   $11,392   and less than 660:   $2,050  . 
  The Company provides general loan loss reserves for mortgage loans based upon the size and class of the mortgage loan and the loan-to-value ratio ( LTV ) at date of origination. The Company divides the LTV analysis into   two   classes, separating the purchased loans from the loans underwritten directly by the Company. Based on historical performance, the Company concluded that originated loans require lower estimated loss rates than purchased loans. The allowance for each class is determined by dividing the outstanding unpaid balance for each loan by the loan-to-value and applying a loss rate. The LTV groupings for each significant mortgage class are as follows:

  The Company s commercial secured portfolio consists of business loans well-collateralized by residential real estate.

The Company divides loan balances when determining general loan loss reserves between purchases and originations as follows: 

From time to time the Company modifies loan terms temporarily for borrowers who are experiencing financial stress. These loans are performing and accruing and will generally return to the original loan terms after the modification term expires. 
    
  Approximately   8.02%   of our non-performing loans and leases at   September 30, 2016   were considered TDRs, compared to   9.63%   at   June 30, 2016  . Borrowers that make timely payments after TDRs are considered non-performing for at least   six months  . Generally, after   six months   of timely payments, those TDRs are reclassified from the non-performing loan and lease category to the performing loan and lease category and any previously deferred interest income is recognized. 
    
  The Company classifies these loans as performing loans temporarily modified as TDR and are included in impaired loans and leases as follows:

     Table of Contents  

The Company recognizes interest on performing loans temporarily modified as TDR, which is shown in conjunction with average balances as follows: 

The Company s loan modifications primarily included single family, multifamily and commercial loans of which included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate or delinquent property taxes that were paid by the Bank and either repaid by the borrower over a   one year   period or capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. The Company s loan modifications also included RV loans in which borrowers were able to make interest-only payments for a period of   six months   to   one year   which then reverted back to fully amortizing. 
  Credit Quality Indicators 
  The Company categorizes loans and leases into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans and leases individually by classifying the loans and leases based on credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings. 
  Pass.   Loans and leases classified as pass are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. 
  Special Mention  . Loans and leases classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
  Substandard  . Loans and leases classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans and leases so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
  Doubtful  . Loans and leases classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
  The Company reviews and grades loans and leases following a continuous review process, featuring coverage of all loan and lease types and business lines at least quarterly.  Continuous reviewing provides more effective risk monitoring because it immediately tests for potential impacts caused by changes in personnel, policy, products or underwriting standards.

The Company received   $51,000   in gross proceeds as a part of this transaction, before the   3.15%   underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The Notes mature on   February 28, 2026   and accrue interest at a rate of   6.25%   per annum, with interest payable quarterly.

  Subordinated Debentures.   On December 13, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to form an unconsolidated trust which issued   $5,000   of trust preferred securities in a transaction that closed on December 16, 2004. The net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase   $5,155   of subordinated debentures (the  Debentures ) of the Company with a stated maturity date of   February 23, 2035  . The Debentures are the sole assets of the trust. The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest through the redemption date. Interest accrues at the rate of   3 months   LIBOR plus   2.4%   for a rate of   3.22%   as of   September 30, 2016  , with interest paid   quarterly   starting   February 16, 2005  . 
   
  7.  EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  On October 22, 2015, the stockholders of the Company approved and in November 2015 the Company s Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation (the  Amendment ) to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance from   50,000,000   to   150,000,000   shares. The purpose for the Amendment was to accommodate a forward stock split through a stock dividend whereby each share of common stock would effectively be split into four shares of common stock (the  Stock Split ). On October 26, 2015, the Board of Directors approved the Stock Split. The Company issued a dividend of three shares of common stock for every one share issued and outstanding as of November 6, 2015. The dividend was paid on November 17, 2015, and BOFI common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on November 18, 2015. Common stock share, per-share, option and restricted stock unit amounts for all comparative periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.  
  On March 17, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company, authorized a program to repurchase up to   $100 million   of common stock. The new share repurchase authorization replaces the previous share repurchase plan approved on July 5, 2005.  The Company may repurchase shares on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate, at the discretion of the Company, and subject to its assessment of alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, general market conditions and regulatory factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. The share repurchase program will continue in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company. 
  The Company has   two   equity incentive plans, the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2014 Plan ) and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2004 Plan  and collectively, the  Plans ), which provide for the granting of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other awards to employees, directors and consultants.  The Plans are designed to encourage selected employees and directors to improve operations and increase profits, and to accept or continue employment or association with the Company through participation in the growth in the value of the common stock. The Plans require that option exercise prices be not less than fair market value per share of common stock on the option grant date for incentive and non-qualified options. The options issued under the Plans generally vest in between   three   and   five   years. Option expiration dates are established by the Plans  administrator but may not be later than   10   years after the date of the grant. 
  2004 Stock Incentive Plan  . In October 2004, the Company s Board of Directors and the stockholders approved the 2004 Plan. In November 2007, the 2004 Plan was amended and approved by the Company s stockholders. With the stockholders approving the 2014 Plan in October 2014, no further awards will be made under the 2004 Plan and the 2004 Plan will remain in effect only so long as awards made thereunder remain outstanding. 
  2014 Stock Incentive Plan  . In September and October 2014, the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Plan, respectively. The maximum number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2014 Plan is   3,680,000  . 
  Stock Options.   At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   there were no outstanding stock options and all expense related to stock option grants has been fully recognized. 
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units  . Employees and directors are eligible to receive grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units. The Company determines stock-based compensation expense using the fair value method. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is equal to the closing sale price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.

During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company granted   659,298   and   104,941   restricted stock units, to employees and directors, respectively. Restricted stock unit awards ( RSUs ) granted during these quarters generally vest over   three   years, one-third on each anniversary date, except for any RSUs granted to our CEO, which vest one-fourth on each fiscal year end. 
  The Company s income before income taxes and net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   include stock award expense of   $3,037   and   $2,258  , with total income tax benefit of   $1,273   and   $938  , respectively.  The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant-date fair value divided by the vesting and the service period between each vesting date. At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards aggregated to   $29,162   and is expected to be recognized in future periods as follows: 

The following table presents the status and changes in restricted stock unit grants for the periods indicated: 

The total fair value of shares vested for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was   $2,996   and   $5,492  .  
   
           8. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE ( EPS ) 
     Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted to common stock that would then share in the Company s earnings.

           9. 
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
     Credit-Related Financial Instruments  . The Company is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments are commitments to extend credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had commitments to originate   $102,504   in fixed rate loans and leases and   $399,577   in variable rate loans, totaling an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $502,081  . Our fixed rate loan and lease commitments to originate had rates ranging from   2.38%   to   7.95%  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had commitments to sell   $84,335   in fixed rate loans and   $1,515   in variable rate loans, totaling an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $85,850  .  
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
  Litigation.   On October 15, 2015, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer were named defendants in a putative class action lawsuit styled Golden v. BofI Holding, Inc., et al, and brought in United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the  Golden Case ). On November 3, 2015, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer were named defendants in a second putative class action lawsuit styled Hazan v. BofI Holding, Inc., et al, and also brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the  Hazan Case ). On February 1, 2016, the Golden Case and the Hazan Case were consolidated as In re BofI Holding, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case #: 3:15-cv-02324-GPC-KSC (the  Class Action ), and the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System was appointed lead plaintiff. The Class Action complaint was amended by a certain Consolidated Amended Class Complaint filed on April 11, 2016. The Class Action plaintiff seeks monetary damages and other relief on behalf of a putative class that has not been certified by the Court. 
  The complaints filed in the Golden Case and the Hazan Case both allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by failing to disclose the wrongful conduct that is alleged in a complaint that was filed in a wrongful termination of employment lawsuit (the  Employment Matter ), and that as a result the Company s statements regarding its internal controls, as well as portions of its financial statements, were false  
  
    35 

     Table of Contents  

and misleading. The Company and the other named defendants dispute the allegations of wrongdoing advanced by the plaintiffs in the Class Action and in the Employment Matter, as well as those plaintiffs  statement of the underlying factual circumstances, and are vigorously defending both cases. 
  In addition to the Class Action,   two   separate shareholder derivative actions were filed in December, 2015, purportedly on behalf of the Company. The first derivative action, Calcaterra v. Garrabrants, et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on December 3, 2015. The second derivative action, Dow v. Micheletti, et al, was filed in the San Diego County Superior Court on December 16, 2015. A third derivative action, DeYoung v. Garrabrants, et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on January 22, 2016, a fourth derivative action, Yong v. Garrabrants, et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on January 29, 2016, and a fifth derivative action, Laborers Pension Trust Fund of Northern Nevada v. Allrich et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on February 2, 2016. Each of these   five   derivative actions names the Company as a nominal defendant, and certain of its officers and directors as defendants. Each complaint sets forth allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, and unjust enrichment against the defendant officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these derivative actions seek damages in unspecified amounts on the Company s behalf from the officer and director defendants, certain corporate governance actions, and an award of their costs and attorney s fees. On June 9, 2016, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ordered the   four   above-referenced cases pending before it to be consolidated, appointed lead counsel in the consolidated action, and ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding a schedule for the filing of a consolidated complaint and defendants  response to the complaint. Pursuant to the June 9, 2016 order, counsel have met and conferred regarding proposals for (a) the time for plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint or provide notice of plaintiffs  intent to rely upon the original Complaint in Case No. 3:15-cv-02722-GPC-KSC (the  operative complaint  (b) the time for defendants to respond to the operative complaint; and (c) a schedule for briefing any motion to dismiss that may be filed by a defendant. A stipulation setting forth the agreed litigation schedule has been submitted to the Court. The fifth derivative action, which is pending before the San Diego County Superior Court, has been stayed by agreement of the parties. On September 27, 2016, the Court dismissed the Class Action, with leave to amend, as to defendants Andrew Micheletti, Paul Grinberg, Nicholas Mosich and James Argalas. The Court denied the Motion to Dismiss with respect to the Company and Gregory Garrabrants. The Company and the other defendants dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending these purported derivative actions.

  General 
       
  Our Company is the holding company for BofI Federal Bank (the  Bank ), a diversified financial services company with approximately   $7.9 billion   in assets that provides consumer and business banking products through its branchless, low-cost distribution channels and affinity partners. The Bank has deposit and loan and lease customers nationwide including consumer and business checking, savings and time deposit accounts and financing for single family and multifamily residential properties, small-to-medium size businesses in target sectors, and selected specialty finance receivables. The Bank generates fee income from consumer and business products including fees from loans originated for sale and transaction fees earned from processing payment activity.  BofI Holding, Inc. s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is a component of the Russell 2000        Index, the S P SmallCap 600        Index and the KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index. 
    
  Our Bank is a federal savings bank wholly-owned by our Company and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ). Our Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
  We distribute our deposit products through a wide range of retail distribution channels, and our deposits consist of demand, savings and time deposits accounts. We distribute our loan products through our retail, correspondent and wholesale channels, and the loans we retain are primarily first mortgages secured by single family real property and by multifamily real property. Our mortgage-backed securities consist primarily of mortgage pass-through securities issued by government-sponsored entities and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued by private sponsors. We believe our flexibility to adjust our asset generation channels has been a competitive advantage allowing us to avoid markets and products where credit fundamentals are poor. 
  Mergers and Acquisitions 
    
  From time to time we undertake acquisitions or similar transactions consistent with the Bank s operating and growth strategies. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no such transactions. During fiscal 2016, there were two transactions, which are discussed below. 
    
  H R Block Bank Deposit Acquisition and Program Management Agreement 
  On August 31, 2015, our Bank completed the acquisition of approximately $419 million in deposits consisting of checking, individual retirement savings, and CD accounts from H R Block Bank and its parent company, H R Block, Inc. ( H R Block ). In connection with the closing of this transaction: (i) our Bank and Emerald Financial Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability

company and wholly-owned subsidiary of H R Block ( EFS ), entered into the Program Management Agreement ( PMA ), dated August 31, 2015; (ii) our Bank and H R Block, EFS, HRB Participant I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of H R Block, entered into the Emerald Receivables Participation Agreement, dated August 31, 2015; and (iii) our Bank and H R Block entered into the Guaranty Agreement (together, the  PMA and related Agreements ), dated August 31, 2015. Through the PMA and related Agreements our Bank will provide H R Block-branded financial services products and services. The three products and services that represent the primary focus and the majority of transactional volume that our Bank will process are described in detail below.  
  The first product is Emerald Prepaid MasterCard  services, which is under Schedule A of the PMA. Our Bank is responsible for the primary oversight and control of the prepaid card programs of a wholly owned subsidiary of H R Block. Under the PMA and related Agreements, our Bank holds the prepaid card customer deposits for those cards issued under the prepaid programs in non-interest bearing accounts and earns a fixed fee paid by H R Block s subsidiary for each automated clearing house ( ACH ) transaction processed through the prepaid card customer accounts. A portion of H R Block s customers use the Emerald Card as an option to receive federal and state income tax refunds. The prepaid customer deposits are included in non-interest bearing deposit liabilities on our balance sheet and the ACH fee income is included in our income statement under the line banking service fees and other income. 
  The second product is Refund Transfer, which is under Schedule B of the PMA. Our Bank is responsible for the primary oversight and control of the refund transfer program of a wholly owned subsidiary of H R Block. Under the PMA and related Agreements, our Bank opens a temporary bank account for each H R Block customer who is receiving an income tax refund and elects to defer payment of his or her tax preparations fees. After the Internal Revenue Service and any state income tax authorities transfer the refund into the customer s account, the net funds are transferred to the customer and the temporary deposit account is closed. Our Bank earns a fixed fee paid by H R Block for each of the H R Block customers electing a Refund Transfer. The fees are earned primarily in the quarter ended March 31   st    and are included in our income statement under the line banking service fees and other income.

The lines of credit are included in loans and leases on our balance sheet and the interest income and fee income are included in our income statement under the line loans and leases interest and dividend income. 
  The fourth product is an Individual Retirement Account ( IRA ).  Our Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in August 2015, but the initial offering of this product through H R Block offices is planned for the upcoming tax season. Our Bank is responsible for the primary oversight and control of the IRA product. During a tax preparation session with an H R Block tax preparer, the customer is given an option to open a traditional IRA or Roth IRA savings account with our Bank. If the customer elects the option to open an account and meets our Bank s requirements, an account is opened on our Bank s core operating system under our Bank s oversight and control. The customer has the option to deposit funds for the IRA through check or ACH. Our Bank provides IRA custodial services, earns a nominal fee paid by the customers for any accounts closures or transfers out, and pays customers interest based on their IRA balance. The fees are included in our income statement under the line banking service fees and other income and interest paid is included under the line deposit interest expense. 
  The fifth product is an interest-free Refund Advance loan. Our Bank entered into agreements to offer this product in October 2016. Under the agreements our Bank will perform disbursement and repayment services and provide funding for interest-free Refund Advance loans to H R Block customers. Our Bank, in conjunction with its agreement partners, offers and funds interest-free loans to consumers, secured by the consumer s tax refund receivable, primarily through the H R Block tax preparation offices and earns interest income and fee income. The average life of the Refund Advance loan is expected to be ten days. Our Bank retains the Refund Advance loans that it funds and will be included in loans and leases on our balance sheet and the interest income and fee income will be included in our income statement under the line loans and leases interest and dividend income. 
  The H R Block-branded financial services products introduce seasonality into the unaudited condensed consolidated income statements through the banking and service fees category of non-interest income and the other general and administrative category of non-interest expense, with the peak income and expense in these categories typically occurring during our third fiscal quarter ended March 31.

liabilities. The purchase price and total consideration paid for the assets consisted of the fair market value of the assumed liabilities plus a lease purchase price premium of approximately 2.5%.  
  Four-for-One Forward Split of Common Stock 
  On October 22, 2015, our stockholders approved and in November 2015 our Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the our certificate of incorporation (the  Amendment ) to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance from 50,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares. The purpose for the Amendment was to accommodate a forward stock split through a stock dividend whereby each share of common stock would effectively be split into four shares of common stock (the  Stock Split ). On October 26, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the Stock Split. We issued a dividend of three shares of common stock for every one share issued and outstanding as of November 6, 2015. The dividend was paid on November 17, 2015, and BOFI common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on November 18, 2015. Common stock share and per-share amounts for all comparative periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods. 
  Our significant accounting policies and practices are described in greater detail in Note 1 to our   June 30, 2016   audited consolidated financial statements and under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year end   June 30, 2016  . 
  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings. We define net income without the after-tax impact of realized and unrealized securities gains and losses as adjusted earnings ( adjusted earnings ), a non-GAAP measurement, which we believe provides useful information about the Bank s operating performance.  Excluding the securities gains and losses provides investors with an understanding of our Bank s core lending and mortgage banking business.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited.  Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious as their use of such measures.  Although we believe the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors  understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Comparison of the Three months ending     September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had net income of   $28.9 million   compared to net income of   $25.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income attributable to common stockholders was   $28.8 million   or   $0.45   per diluted share for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of   $25.4 million   or   $0.40   per diluted share for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .    
  Other key comparisons between our operating results for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 
             
    Net interest income increased   $10.7 million   due to a   25.6%     increase   in average earning assets in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increase was primarily the result of growth in our loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our deposit portfolio. Our net interest margin   decreased     24   basis points in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  . The average yield on interest earning assets decreased by   11   basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates for new loans and borrower repayments of higher rate loans. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by   17   basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  . The increase in higher rate demand and savings and time deposits were the primary reason for the increase in average rates paid for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  . 
                
    Non-interest income   increased     $4.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $4.9 million     increase   in non-interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of a   $3.3 million   increase in mortgage banking and a   $2.2 million   increase in banking service fees and other income, primarily due to H R Block-branded products and service fee income.  
                
    Non-interest expense   increased     $10.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , salaries and related expenses increased   $5.1 million   due to the overall increase in staff. Data processing and interest costs increased   $1.3 million  , professional services increased   $1.0 million   and advertising and promotional expenses increased   $0.9 million   to support of increased operations. 
     Non-GAAP adjusted earnings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $28.3 million   and   $25.5 million  , respectively.  
  Below is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted earnings: 

Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $69.8 million  , an   increase   of   18.0%   compared to net interest income of   $59.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The growth of net interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   is primarily due to net loan portfolio growth which increased average earnings assets. 
  Total interest and dividend income during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   22.8%   to   $87.5 million  , compared to   $71.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in interest and dividend income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to growth in average earning assets from loan originations, primarily in the single family and C I portfolios. The average balance of loans increased   24.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Total interest expense was   $17.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $5.6 million   or   46.3%   as compared with the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to growth in average interest-bearing liabilities of   24.2%   and an increase in the

     Table of Contents  

average funding rate of   17   basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015  . The increase in the average cost of funds rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   was primarily due to an 8 basis point increase in average rates paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, a 21 basis point increase in average rates paid on time deposits and a 3.76% increase in average rates paid on subordinated notes and debentures and other. 
  Net interest margin, defined as annualized net interest income divided by average earning assets,   decreased   by   24   basis points to   3.78%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The   decrease   in net interest margin was primarily the result of the above discussed increase in average rates paid on interest-bearing demand and savings accounts, an increase in average rates paid on time deposits and a decrease of 11 basis points on the average yield of interest earning assets.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses  
  The loan and lease loss provision was   $1.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in the provision is primarily the result of changes in loan mix, slower loan growth and lower outstanding balances associated with certain older vintage loans that carried increased allocations of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan and lease losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under  Financial Condition Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Loss .

Non-Interest Income 
  The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest income for the periods shown: 

Non-interest income increased   $4.9 million   to   $14.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was the result of an increase of   $3.3 million   in mortgage banking income, an increase of   $2.2 million   in banking service fees and other income, an increase of   $1.0 million   realized gain on sale of securities and an increase of   $0.4 million   in prepayment penalty fee income, partially offset by a decrease of   $2.0 million   in gain on sale   other. 
  Included in gain on sale   other are sales of structured settlement annuity receivables. We engage in the wholesale and retail purchase of state lottery prize and structured settlement annuity payments. These payments are high credit quality deferred payment receivables having a state lottery commission or investment grade (top two tiers) insurance company payor. The Bank originates contracts for the retail purchase of such payments and classifies these under the heading of Factoring in the loan portfolio. Factoring yields are typically higher than mortgage loan rates. Typically, the gain received upon sale of these payment streams is greater than the gain received from an equivalent amount of mortgage loan sales.  Since 2013, pools of structured settlement receivables have been originated for sale depending upon management s assessment of interest rate risk, liquidity, and offers containing favorable terms and are classified on our balance sheet as loans held for sale.

Non-Interest Expense 
  The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest expense for the periods shown:    

  Non-interest expense, which is comprised primarily of compensation, professional services, occupancy and equipment, data processing and internet expenses, advertising and promotional and other operating expenses, was   $32.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , up from   $22.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the expansion of the Bank, specifically in areas related to lending, information technology infrastructure development and regulatory compliance. 
  Total salaries and related costs increased   $5.1 million   to   $19.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $14.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   due to increased staffing levels to support growth in deposit and lending activities. Our staff increased to 626 from 503, or 24.5% between   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Professional services, which include accounting and legal fees, increased   $1.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily attributable to increased legal fees and decreased insurance reimbursement. 
  Data processing and internet expense increased   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to enhancements to the Bank s core processing system. 
  Advertising and promotional expense increased   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to online, email and direct leads marketing expenses. 
  The cost of our Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and OCC standard regulatory charges increased   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three month period ending   September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to the overall growth of the Bank s liabilities. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. 
  Other general and administrative costs increased by   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three month period ended   September 30, 2015   primarily related to costs supporting loan and deposit production. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  Our effective income tax rates (income tax provision divided by net income before income tax) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   41.90%   and   41.51%  , respectively. The changes in the tax rates are the result of state tax rate increases and changes in state tax allocations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Balance Sheet Analysis 
  Our total assets   increased     $253.7 million  , or   3.3%  , to   $7,855.0 million  , as of   September 30, 2016  ,   up   from   $7,601.4 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The   increase   in total assets was primarily due to an   increase   of   $195.1 million   in net loans held for investment. Total liabilities   increased     $215.4 million  , primarily from growth in deposits of   $279.8 million  , partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advances of   $72.0 million  . 
  Loans and Leases 
  Net loans and leases held for investment   increased     3.1%   to   $6,549.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $6,354.7 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The   increase   in the loan and lease portfolio was primarily due to loan and lease originations and purchases of   $925.2 million  , partially offset by loan and lease repayments and other adjustments of   $730.1 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table sets forth the composition of the loan and lease portfolio as of the dates indicated: 

The Bank originates some interest only loans with terms that include repayments that are less than the repayments for fully amortizing loans. Also, the Bank previously purchased option adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) loans and other loan types that permit payments that may be smaller than interest accruals. The Bank s lending guidelines for interest only loans are adjusted for the increased credit risk associated with these loans by requiring borrowers with such loans to borrow at LTVs that are lower than standard amortizing ARM loans and by calculating debt to income ratios for qualifying borrowers based upon a fully amortizing payment, not the interest only payment. The Bank monitors and performs reviews of interest only loans. Adverse trends reflected in the Company s delinquency statistics, grading and classification of interest only loans would be reported to management and the Board of Directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $828.0 million   of interest only mortgage loans and   $2.9 million   of option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Through   September 30, 2016  , the net amount of deferred interest on these loan types was not material to the financial position or operating results of the Company.

Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Loss 
  Non-performing Assets 
  Non-performing loans are comprised of loans past due   90 days   or more on nonaccrual status and other nonaccrual loans. Non-performing assets include non-performing loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles. At   September 30, 2016  , our non-performing loans totaled   $42.0 million  , or   0.64%   of total gross loans and our total non-performing assets totaled   $43.4 million  , or   0.55%   of total assets. 
  Non-performing loans and foreclosed assets or  non-performing assets  consisted of the following as of the dates indicated: 

Total non-performing assets   increased   from   $32.1 million   at   June 30, 2016   to   $43.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  As a percentage of total assets, non-performing assets   increased   from   0.42%   at   June 30, 2016   to   0.55%   at   September 30, 2016  . The non-performing assets   increase   of approximately   $11.3 million   was primarily the result of increases in non-performing single family real estate secured loans, multifamily real estate secured loans and foreclosed real estate assets. 
  A troubled debt restructuring is a concession made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties, typically permanent or temporary modifications of principal and interest payments or an extension of maturity dates. When a loan is delinquent and classified as a troubled debt restructuring no interest is accrued until the borrower demonstrates over time (typically   six months  ) that it can make payments. When a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring and is on nonaccrual, it is considered non-performing and included in the table above. The Bank had performing troubled debt restructurings with outstanding balances totaling   $0.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $0.2 million   at   June 30, 2016  . 
  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
  We are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is considered to be commensurate with estimated and known risks in the portfolio. Although the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly, our management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the portfolio. While we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate at   September 30, 2016  , future additions to the allowance will be subject to continuing evaluation of estimated and known, as well as inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio. 
  The assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses is based upon a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including levels and trends of past due and nonaccrual loans and leases, change in volume and mix of loans and leases, collateral values and charge-off history. 
  We provide general loan loss reserves for our auto and RV loans based upon the borrower credit score at the time of origination and the Company s loss experience to date. The allowance for loan loss for the auto and RV loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was determined by classifying each outstanding loan according to the semi-annually refreshed FICO score and providing loss rates. The Company had   $93.5 million   of RV and auto loan balances subject to general reserves as follows: FICO greater than or equal to 770:   $36.0 million  ; 715   769:   $33.9 million  ; 700   714:   $10.2 million  ; 660   699:   $11.4 million   and less than 660:   $2.1 million  .

     Table of Contents  

We experienced increased charge-offs of RV loans in fiscal 2007 through 2011, due to the nationwide recession. Our  portfolio of RV loans is expected to decrease in the future because the Bank ceased originating RV loans in fiscal 2009. 
  The Company provides general loan loss reserves for mortgage loans based upon the size and class of the mortgage loan and the loan-to-value ratio ( LTV ) at date of origination. The allowance for each class is determined by dividing the outstanding unpaid balance for each loan by the loan-to-value and applying quantitative and qualitative loss rates. The LTV groupings for each significant mortgage class are as follows: 
  The Company had   $3,688.1 million   of single family mortgage portfolio loan balances subject to general reserves as follows: LTV less than or equal to 60%:   $1,951.8 million  ; 61%   70%:   $1,367.2 million  ; 71%   80%:   $368.9 million  ; greater than 80%:   $0.2 million  . 
  The Company had   $1,396.8 million   of multifamily mortgage portfolio loan balances subject to general reserves as follows: LTV less than or equal to 55%:   $648.9 million  ; 56%   65%:   $451.6 million  ; 66%   75%:   $283.7 million  ; 76%   80%:   $12.5 million   and greater than 80%:   $0.0 million  . 
  The Company had   $136.3 million   of commercial real estate loan balances subject to general reserves as follows: LTV less than or equal to 50%:   $61.6 million  ; 51%   60%:   $30.2 million  ; 61%   70%:   $38.7 million  ; and 71%   80%:   $5.8 million  . 
  The weighted average LTV percentage for our entire real estate loan portfolio was 57% at   September 30, 2016  . We believe that this percentage is lower and more conservative than most banks, which results in lower average mortgage loan charge-offs when compared to many other comparable banks. 
  While we anticipate that such level of charge-offs will continue into the future, given the uncertainties surrounding the improvement of the U.S. economy, we may experience an increase in the relative amount of charge-offs and we may be required to increase our loan and lease loss provisions in the future to provide a larger loss allowance for one or more of our loan and lease types. 
  The following table summarizes impaired loans and leases as of: 

The following table reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases as of the dates indicated: 

The loan and lease loss provision was   $1.9 million   and   $2.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The   decrease   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   in the loan and lease loss provision was primarily the result of changes in loan and lease mix, slower loan growth and lower outstanding balances associated with certain older vintage loans that carried increased allocations of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that the lower

     Table of Contents  

average LTV in the Bank s mortgage loan portfolio will continue to result in future lower average mortgage loan charge-offs when compared to many other comparable banks. Our general loan and lease loss reserves are based upon historical losses and expected future trends. The resolution of the Bank s existing other real estate owned and non-performing loans should not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. 
  Investment Securities 
  Total investment securities were   $452.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $472.2 million   at   June 30, 2016  . During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased five debt securities for $24.7 million, sold $24.8 million of securities and received principal repayments of approximately $29.2 million in our available-for-sale portfolio. The remainder of the change for the available-for-sale portfolio is attributable to accretion and other activities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we elected to reclassify all of our HTM securities to AFS. While we have the ability to hold those transferred securities to maturity and as of September 30, 2016 do not intend to sell the securities, we concluded that there are now sufficient uncertainties associated with i) future fiscal and monetary policy resulting from domestic and international political changes, ii) future interpretations and applications of new accounting principles and regulatory guidance; iii) the pace of future market interest rate increases given that market interest rates remain at historical lows and the absence of clear forward-looking guidance set by Federal Reserve Board of Governors, all of which could, depending upon the outcomes, change our intent to hold our securities. Under Accounting Standards Codification 320-10 Investments Debt Securities, there are very limited exceptions that allow an entity to reclassify or sell one or more securities from HTM and still use the HTM classification. We concluded that such exceptions may not apply to all results and elected to reclassify all HTM securities to AFS understanding that such reclassification will immediately eliminate our ability to use the HTM classification for our securities portfolio for a period of time not to be less than one year. We will perform periodic assessments in the future to determine whether the above referenced uncertainties have been resolved and we have the positive intent and ability to hold securities until maturity. The net carrying amount of the securities reclassified in September 2016 from HTM to AFS was   $194.2 million   and the fair value of AFS securities at September 30, 2016 is reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The reclassification resulted in an unrealized gain recognized through other comprehensive income of   $3.6 million   in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
  Deposits 
  Deposits increased a net   $279.8 million  , or   4.6%  , to   $6,323.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $6,044.1 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Our deposit growth was primarily the result of a   15.7%   increase in interest-bearing checking accounts. Increases in business banking customers resulted in higher demand account business. 
  The following table sets forth the composition of the deposit portfolio as of the dates indicated:

Borrowings 
  The following table sets forth the composition of our borrowings and the interest rates at the dates indicated: 

At   September 30, 2016  , total borrowings amounted to   $746.5 million  ,   down     $71.5 million  , or   8.7%  , from   June 30, 2016   and down   $114.6 million   or   13.3%   from   September 30, 2015  . Total borrowings represented   9.5%   of total assets and had a weighted-average cost of borrowing of   1.99%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   10.8%   of total assets at a weighted-average cost of borrowing of   2.01%   at   June 30, 2016   and   13.8%   of total assets at a weighted-average cost of borrowing of   1.21%   at   September 30, 2015  . 
  We have sold securities under various agreements to repurchase for total proceeds of   $35.0 million  . The repurchase agreements have interest rates between 3.75% and 4.75% and scheduled maturities between April 2017 and December 2017.  Under these agreements, we may be required to repay the   $35.0 million   and repurchase our securities before the scheduled maturity if the issuer requests repayment on scheduled quarterly call dates. The weighted-average remaining contractual maturity period is 0.85 years and the weighted average remaining period before such repurchase agreements could be called is 0.14 years. 
  We regularly use advances from the FHLB to manage our interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, manage our liquidity position. Generally, FHLB advances with terms between   three   and   ten years   have been used to fund the purchase of single family and multifamily mortgages and to provide us with interest rate risk protection should rates rise. At   September 30, 2016  , a total of $5.0 million of FHLB advances include agreements that allow the FHLB, at its option, to put the advances back to us after specified dates. The weighted-average remaining contractual maturity period of the $5.0 million in putable advances is 1.32 years and the weighted average remaining period before such advances could be put to us is 0.07 years. 
  Stockholders  Equity 
  Stockholders  equity increased   $38.3 million   to   $721.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $683.6 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The increase was the result of our net income for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   of   $28.9 million  , vesting and issuance of RSUs and exercise of stock options of   $1.5 million  , a   $7.9 million   unrealized gain in other comprehensive income, net of tax, less a reduction of   $0.1 million   for dividends declared on preferred stock.

LIQUIDITY 
  Cash flow information is as follows: 

During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had net cash   inflows   from operating activities of   $65.5 million   compared to inflows of   $41.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net operating cash inflows and outflows fluctuate primarily due to the timing of originations of loans held for sale and proceeds from loan sales. 
  Net cash   outflows   from investing activities totaled   $160.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , while outflows totaled   $286.3 million   for the same period in fiscal year   2016  . The   decrease   was primarily due to increased repayments loans and leases in the fiscal 2017 period compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  Our net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $207.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   $389.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net cash provided by financing activities   decreased   primarily from a decrease in net borrowings from FHLB for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  . 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank could borrow up to 40.0% of its total assets from the FHLB. Borrowings are collateralized by the pledge of certain mortgage loans and investment securities to the FHLB. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $999.2 million   available immediately and an additional   $57.0 million   available with additional collateral. At   September 30, 2016  , we also had two unsecured federal funds purchase lines with two different banks totaling $35.0 million, under which no borrowings were outstanding. 
  The Bank has the ability to borrow short-term from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Discount Window. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank did not have any borrowings outstanding and the amount available from this source was   $57.8 million  . The credit line is collateralized by consumer loans and mortgage-backed securities. 
  In an effort to expand the Bank s liquidity options, we have issued brokered deposits of   $704.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . We believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate for our anticipated needs and contingencies. We believe we have the ability to increase our level of deposits and borrowings to address our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments to originate loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $502.1 million  , and commitments to sell loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $85.9 million  .  We have no commitments to purchase loans, leases, investment securities or any other unused lines of credit. 
  Litigation.   On October 15, 2015, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer were named defendants in a putative class action lawsuit styled Golden v. BofI Holding, Inc., et al, and brought in United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the  Golden Case ). On November 3, 2015, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer were named defendants in a second putative class action lawsuit styled Hazan v. BofI Holding, Inc., et al, and also brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the  Hazan Case ). On February 1, 2016, the Golden Case and the Hazan Case were consolidated as In re BofI Holding, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case #: 3:15-cv-02324-GPC-KSC (the  Class Action ), and the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System was appointed lead plaintiff. The Class Action complaint was amended by a certain Consolidated Amended Class Complaint filed on April 11, 2016. The Class Action plaintiff seeks monetary damages and other relief on behalf of a putative class that has not been certified by the Court. 
  The complaints filed in the Golden Case and the Hazan Case both allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by failing to disclose the wrongful conduct that is alleged in a complaint that was filed in a wrongful termination of employment lawsuit (the  Employment Matter ), and that as a result the Company s statements regarding its internal controls, as well as portions of its financial statements, were false and misleading. The Company and the other named defendants dispute the allegations of wrongdoing advanced by the plaintiffs in the Class Action and in the Employment Matter, as well as those plaintiffs  statement of the underlying factual circumstances, and are vigorously defending both cases.

In addition to the Class Action, two separate shareholder derivative actions were filed in December, 2015, purportedly on behalf of the Company. The first derivative action, Calcaterra v. Garrabrants, et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on December 3, 2015. The second derivative action, Dow v. Micheletti, et al, was filed in the San Diego County Superior Court on December 16, 2015. A third derivative action, DeYoung v. Garrabrants, et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on January 22, 2016, a fourth derivative action, Yong v. Garrabrants, et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on January 29, 2016, and a fifth derivative action, Laborers Pension Trust Fund of Northern Nevada v. Allrich et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on February 2, 2016. Each of these five derivative actions names the Company as a nominal defendant, and certain of its officers and directors as defendants. Each complaint sets forth allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, and unjust enrichment against the defendant officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these derivative actions seek damages in unspecified amounts on the Company s behalf from the officer and director defendants, certain corporate governance actions, and an award of their costs and attorney s fees. On June 9, 2016, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ordered the four above-referenced cases pending before it to be consolidated, appointed lead counsel in the consolidated action, and ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding a schedule for the filing of a consolidated complaint and defendants  response to the complaint. Pursuant to the June 9, 2016 order, counsel have met and conferred regarding proposals for (a) the time for plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint or provide notice of plaintiffs  intent to rely upon the original Complaint in Case No. 3:15-cv-02722-GPC-KSC (the  operative complaint  (b) the time for defendants to respond to the operative complaint; and (c) a schedule for briefing any motion to dismiss that may be filed by a defendant. A stipulation setting forth the agreed litigation schedule has been submitted to the Court. The fifth derivative action, which is pending before the San Diego County Superior Court, has been stayed by agreement of the parties. On September 27, 2016, the Court dismissed the Class Action, with leave to amend, as to defendants Andrew Micheletti, Paul Grinberg, Nicholas Mosich and James Argalas. The Court denied the Motion to Dismiss with respect to the Company and Gregory Garrabrants. The Company and the other defendants dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending these purported derivative actions. 
  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
  The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business primarily as a source of funds for its asset growth and to meet required capital needs.  Our time deposits due within one year of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $472.5 million  . We believe the large percentage of time deposits that mature within one year reflects customers  hesitancy to invest their funds long term. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we may be required to seek other sources of funds, including other time deposits and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on deposits and borrowings than we currently pay on time deposits maturing within one year. However, based on past experience we believe a significant portion of our time deposits will remain with us. We believe we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting interest rates offered. 
  The following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of the period indicated:  

________________________________ 
            1.   
    Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, time deposits and operating leases as shown. We had no capitalized leases or material commitments for capital expenditures at   September 30, 2016  . 
               2.   
    Amounts include principal and interest due to recipient. 
               3.   
    Payments are for leases of real property. 
      
  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS 
  Our Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies. Failure by our Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for our Company and the OCC has similar requirements for our Bank. The following tables present regulatory capital information for our Company and Bank. Information presented for   September 30, 2016  , reflects the Basel III capital requirements that became effective January 1, 2015 for both our Company and Bank.  Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, our Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our Company and Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as  
  
    54 

     Table of Contents  

calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our Company s and Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
  Quantitative measures established by regulation require our Company and Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios. Federal bank regulators require our Company and Bank maintain minimum ratios of core capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0%, common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. To be  well capitalized,  our Company and Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , our Company and Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject to and were  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since   September 30, 2016   that would materially adversely change the Company s and Bank s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support our Company s and Bank s further growth and to maintain their  well capitalized  status.  
  The Bank s capital amounts, capital ratios and capital requirements under Basel III were as follows: 

Beginning January 1, 2016, Basel III implemented a requirement for all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of common equity tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not the leverage ratio. At   September 30, 2016  , our Company and Bank are in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirement. The three risk-based capital ratios will increase by 0.625% each year through 2019, at which point, the common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratio minimums will be 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.  
  In connection with the approval of the acquisition of the H R Block Bank deposits on September 1, 2015, the Bank executed a letter agreement with the OCC to maintain its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio at a minimum of 8.50% for the quarters ended in June, September and December and a minimum of 8.00% for the quarter ended in March, subject to certain adjustments. At   September 30, 2016   the Bank is in compliance with this letter agreement.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We measure interest rate sensitivity as the difference between amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that mature or contractually re-price within a given period of time. The difference, or the interest rate sensitivity gap, provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would be in a better position than an institution with a negative gap to invest in higher yielding assets or to have its asset yields adjusted upward, which would cause the yield on its assets to increase at a faster pace than the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities. During a period of falling interest rates, however, an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its assets reprice at a faster rate than one with a negative gap, which would tend to reduce the growth in its net interest income. 
  The following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that were outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and the portions of each financial instrument that are expected to mature or reset interest rates in each future period:  

1.       
    Comprised of agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and other non-agency debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and trading. 
     The above table provides an approximation of the projected re-pricing of assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   on the basis of contractual maturities, adjusted for anticipated prepayments of principal and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan and securities prepayment rates reflected herein are based on historical experience. For the non-maturity deposit liabilities, we use decay rates and rate adjustments based upon our historical experience. Actual repayments of these instruments could vary substantially if future experience differs from our historic experience.

Although  gap  analysis is a useful measurement device available to management in determining the existence of interest rate exposure, its static focus as of a particular date makes it necessary to utilize other techniques in measuring exposure to changes in interest rates. For example, gap analysis is limited in its ability to predict trends in future earnings and makes no assumptions about changes in prepayment tendencies or deposit or loan maturity preferences. 
  The following table indicates the sensitivity of net interest income movements to parallel instantaneous shocks in interest rates for the future   1  -  12   months and   13  -  24   months  time periods.  For purposes of modeling net interest income sensitivity the Bank assumes no growth in the balance sheet other than for retained earnings:  

We attempt to measure the effect market interest rate changes will have on the net present value of assets and liabilities, which is defined as market value of equity. The market value of equity for these purposes is not intended to refer to the trading pricing of our common stock. We analyze the market value of equity sensitivity to an immediate parallel and sustained shift in interest rates derived from the current treasury and LIBOR yield curves. For rising interest rate scenarios, the industry market interest rate forecast was increased by 100, 200 and 300 basis points. 
  The following table indicates the sensitivity of market value of equity to the interest rate movement described above:  

The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of interest rates, asset prepayments, runoffs in deposits and changes in repricing levels of deposits to general market rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Furthermore, these computations do not take into account any actions that we may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates.

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
       
  Management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     The information set forth in Note 9      Commitments And Contingencies    to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. 
  In addition, from time to time we may be a party to other claims or litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims to enforce liens, claims involving the origination and servicing of loans, and other issues related to the business of the Bank. None of such matters are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or business. 

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry. These risks are described in more detail under Part 1,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . We encourage you to read these factors in their entirety. Moreover, other factors may also exist that we cannot anticipate or that we currently do not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available.  

ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
     The table below sets forth our market repurchases of BofI common stock and the BofI common shares retained in connection with net settlement of restricted stock awards during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . On March 17, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company s stock. The new share repurchase authorization replaces the previous share repurchase plan approved on July 5, 2005. The Company may repurchase shares of common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate, at the discretion of the Company, and subject to its assessment of alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, general market conditions and regulatory factors. The stock repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and will continue in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company. Shares of common stock repurchased under this plan will be held as treasury shares. No shares were purchased under the plan during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

              b)

              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal controls over financial reporting.
