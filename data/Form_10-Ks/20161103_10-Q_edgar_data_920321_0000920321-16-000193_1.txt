  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1. Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") of Cenveo, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Cenveo" or the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and, in the Company s opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position as of   October 1, 2016  , and the results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  . Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , are generally not indicative of the results to be expected for any interim period or for the full year, primarily due to restructuring, acquisition and debt-related activities or transactions. The   January 2, 2016   consolidated balance sheet has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  , filed with the SEC. Certain amounts in the   January 2, 2016   condensed consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The reporting periods for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , each consisted of 13 and 39 weeks, respectively. 
    
  As a result of exploring opportunities to divest certain non-strategic or underperforming businesses within its manufacturing platform, during the first quarter of 2016 the Company completed the sale of its folded carton and shrink sleeve packaging businesses, along with its one top-sheet lithographic print operation (collectively, the "Packaging Business"). See Note 3 for information regarding the completion of the sale of the Packaging Business. As a result, the financial results of the Packaging Business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The Company's historical condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give recognition to the discontinued operations for all periods presented.  
    
  On July 8, 2016, the Company announced a reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), at a ratio of 1-for-8, effective July 13, 2016 (the "Reverse Stock Split"). The Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 14, 2016. The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company s stockholders at the annual meeting of the stockholders held on May 26, 2016. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each eight pre-split shares of Common Stock outstanding were automatically combined into one new share of Common Stock without any action on the part of the respective holders, and the number of outstanding common shares on the date of the split was reduced from approximately   68.5 million   shares to approximately   8.5 million   shares. The Reverse Stock Split also applied to Common Stock issuable upon the exchange of the Company s outstanding 7% senior exchangeable notes due 2017 (the "7% Notes") and upon the exercise of the Company s outstanding warrants and the Company's outstanding stock options, restricted share units ("RSUs"), and performance share units ("PSUs"), (collectively, the "Equity Awards"). In addition, the authorized Common Stock was initially increased from   100 million   to   120 million   shares and then adjusted in the Reverse Stock Split from   120 million   to   15 million   shares. The Company's historical condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give recognition to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. 
    
    New Accounting Pronouncements:   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ." The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The standard requires that a company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company expects that the future adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "  Inventory (Topic 340): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ." Under ASU 2015-11, companies utilizing the first-in, first-out or average cost method should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, whereas net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company expects that the future adoption of ASU 2015-11 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ." ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes to require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current  
  
   5 

    CENVEO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

in a classified balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   $2.0 million   of current deferred tax assets that would be reclassified from prepaid and other current assets to other assets, net in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "  Leases (Topic 842)."   The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ." The new standard simplifies various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the consolidated financial statements. The amendments include income tax consequences, the accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company expects that the future adoption of ASU 2016-09 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    ASU 2016-15 reduces the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company expects that the future adoption of ASU 2016-15 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

2. Acquisitions 
    
  The Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805 "  Business Combination  ". Acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses have been recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over their estimated fair values recorded as goodwill. In the event the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired exceed the purchase price paid, a bargain purchase gain is recorded in the statements of operations. 
    
  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s statements of operations were   zero   for both the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and were   $0.7 million   and   $1.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Asendia 
    
  On August 7, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets of Asendia USA, Inc. ("Asendia"). The acquired assets provide letter shop, data processing, bindery and digital printing offerings and had approximately   40   employees. The total purchase price of approximately   $2.0 million   was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, and was assigned to the Company's print segment. The acquired identifiable intangible assets relate to customer relationships of   $0.1 million  .

The results of operations and cash flows are included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from August 7, 2015. Pro forma results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , assuming the acquisition had been made on December 29, 2013, are not presented, as the effect would not be material. 

3. Discontinued Operations 
       
  On January 19, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Packaging Business. The Company received total cash proceeds of approximately   $88.1 million  , net of transaction costs of approximately   $6.3 million  . This resulted in the recognition of a total loss of   $5.1 million  , of which a gain of   $1.2 million   and a loss of   $0.1 million   were recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on the sale of   $5.0 million  . The loss was based on the executed purchase agreement and the net assets of the Packaging Business. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of   $9.9 million   related to this transaction. In addition to the proceeds,   $5.0 million   of purchase price consideration has been held in escrow (the "Holdback Amount") and will be paid to the Company subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Any amount received from the Holdback Amount will be recognized as income when received.  
       
  The following table shows the components of assets and liabilities that are classified as discontinued operations in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 1, 2016  , and   January 2, 2016   (in thousands):

Sale-Leaseback Transaction 
    
  On June 30, 2016, the Company sold the real estate used by   one   manufacturing facility related to its envelope segment for net proceeds of   $7.9 million   and entered into a   five   year operating lease for the same facility, with options to renew for up to two additional five year periods. In connection with the sale, the Company maintained continuing involvement in one capital improvement project which, under ASC 840 "  Leases,  " resulted in the deferral of sale-leaseback accounting. During the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company no longer maintained any continuing involvement obligations and accordingly the transaction qualified for sales-leaseback accounting. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of approximately   $2.1 million   in other income, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and a deferred gain of approximately   $2.8 million   which will be recognized ratably over the original five year lease.  

6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill as of   October 1, 2016  , by reportable segment are as follows (in thousands):

  Long-term debt is as follows (in thousands):

The estimated fair value of the Company s outstanding indebtedness was approximately   $937.8 million   and   $895.7 million   as of   October 1, 2016  , and   January 2, 2016  , respectively. The fair value was determined by the Company to be Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy, and was based upon review of observable pricing in secondary markets for each debt instrument. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants under its long-term debt.

Exchange Offer 
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Cenveo Corporation (the "Subsidiary Issuer") closed its exchange offer (the "Exchange Offer") whereby   $149.3 million  , or approximately   80%  , of its outstanding 11.5% senior notes due 2017 (the "11.5% Notes") were exchanged for   $104.5 million   of newly issued 6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the "6.000% Unsecured Notes") and warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase shares of Common Stock, representing in the aggregate   16.6%   of the outstanding Common Stock as of June 10, 2016. Subsequent to the Exchange Offer,   $40.5 million   of 11.5% Notes remained outstanding as of   October 1, 2016  . Included in the total amount exchanged was   $4.2 million   of 11.5% Notes owned by affiliated noteholders, whose notes were exchanged for 6.000% Unsecured Notes and Warrants pursuant to a simultaneous and separately negotiated securities exchange agreement. In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company capitalized debt issuance costs of   $7.4 million  , all of which will be amortized over the life of the 6.000% Unsecured Notes, and of which   $7.3 million   is unamortized at   October 1, 2016  .  
    
  For accounting purposes, the Exchange Offer was treated as an extinguishment of the 11.5% Notes and the issuance of the new 6.000% Unsecured Notes. Upon extinguishment, the net carrying amount of the 11.5% Notes was written off and the 6.000% Unsecured Notes were recorded at fair value based on market comparable transactions at the time of the Exchange Offer. The fair value of the 6.000% Unsecured Notes was based on market value pricing, using observable market-based data for similar issuances (Level 2). The Company estimates the fair value of the 6.000% Unsecured Notes on the date of issuance was   $92.0 million  . The discount of   $12.5 million   was recorded as a component of the gain on early extinguishment of debt, net, and will be amortized over the life of the 6.000% Unsecured Notes using the effective interest method.  
    
  The 6.000% Unsecured Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, Subsidiary Issuer, the other guarantors party thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon ("BNY Mellon"), as trustee. The 6.000% Unsecured Notes will mature on May 15, 2024. Interest on the 6.000% Unsecured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2016. The 6.000% Unsecured Notes and the related guarantees are the Subsidiary Issuer's and the guarantors  senior unsecured obligations. The 6.000% Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company and by certain of its existing and future U.S. subsidiaries (other than the Subsidiary Issuer) and, under certain circumstances, certain of its future Canadian subsidiaries. As such, the 6.000% Unsecured Notes rank pari passu with the Subsidiary Issuer's and the guarantors  existing and future senior indebtedness, senior to the Subsidiary Issuer's and the guarantors  future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 6.000% Unsecured Notes, effectively junior to the Subsidiary Issuer's and the guarantors  existing and future indebtedness that is secured by liens to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities, including trade payables, of the Company s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 6.000% Unsecured Notes. The Indenture contains a number of covenants which, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company's ability and the ability of the Subsidiary Issuer and the other subsidiaries of the Company to incur additional indebtedness; declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to shareholders; purchase or prepay subordinated indebtedness; make investments; create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates. The Indenture also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. 
    
  The Warrants were issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the "Warrant Agreement"), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as warrant agent. Each Warrant is currently exercisable for   0.125   shares of Common Stock at   $12.00   per share as adjusted as a result of the Company s recent Reverse Stock Split, subject to mandatory cashless exercise provisions. The number of shares for which a Warrant may be exercised and the exercise price are subject to adjustment in certain events. The Warrants will be exercisable at any time prior to their expiration on June 10, 2024. The Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which resulted in a fair value of   $6.3 million   for the Warrants. The Company recorded the fair value in paid-in capital in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.

ABL Amendment 
    
  Concurrent with the Exchange Offer, the Company and Subsidiary Issuer entered into Amendment No. 4, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the "ABL Amendment No. 4"), to the Subsidiary Issuer's asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Facility"), which, among other things, extends the term of the ABL Facility through 2021 and reduces the commitments thereunder by   $50 million   to   $190 million  . The ABL Facility now matures in June 2021, with a springing maturity of May 2019 ahead of the Subsidiary Issuer's existing 6.000% senior priority secured notes due 2019 (the "6.000% Secured Notes") in the event that more than   $10.0 million   of the 6.000% Secured Notes remain outstanding at such time. In connection with this amendment, the Company capitalized debt issuance costs of   $2.3 million  . 
    
  Indenture and Note Purchase Agreement 
    
  Concurrent with the Exchange Offer, the Company and Subsidiary Issuer also entered into a secured Indenture and Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the "Indenture and Note Purchase Agreement"), with certain affiliates of or funds managed by Allianz (collectively, the "Purchasers"), pursuant to which Subsidiary Issuer issued 4% secured notes to the Purchasers in an aggregate principal amount of   $50.0 million   (the "4% Secured Notes") at par, the proceeds of which were applied to reduce the outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility. The 4% Secured Notes mature in December 2021, with a springing maturity of May 2019 ahead of the 6.000% Secured Notes. The 4% Secured Notes bear interest at 4% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, commencing September 30, 2016, and are secured by the same collateral that secures the ABL Facility, the 6.000% Secured Notes and the Subsidiary Issuer's existing 8.500% junior priority secured notes due 2022 (the "8.500% Notes"). With respect to the ABL Facility, the 4% Secured Notes rank junior with respect to all collateral up to a certain maximum principal amount of the ABL Facility. With respect to the 6.000% Secured Notes, the 4% Secured Notes rank junior with respect to notes priority collateral and senior with respect to ABL Facility priority collateral. With respect to the 8.500% Notes, the 4% Secured Notes rank senior with respect to all collateral. Such ranking of the 4% Secured Notes with respect to the 6.000% Secured Notes and the 8.500% Notes is the same ranking that the ABL Facility has with such notes. The Indenture and Note Purchase Agreement contains a number of covenants which, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company s ability and the ability of the Subsidiary Issuer and the other subsidiaries of the Company to incur additional indebtedness; declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to shareholders; purchase or prepay certain specified indebtedness; dispose of assets; make investments; grant liens on assets; merge or consolidate or transfer certain assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates. The Indenture and Note Purchase Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants. In connection with the issuance of the 4% Secured Notes, the Company capitalized debt issuance costs of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  7% Note Purchase Agreement 
    
  In addition, on July 18, 2016, the Company, Subsidiary Issuer and Allianz completed the last transactions contemplated by the Support Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2016, among the Company, Subsidiary Issuer and Allianz, pursuant to which Allianz agreed to, among other things, tender and sell to Subsidiary Issuer all of its 7% Notes owned by Allianz in the aggregate principal amount of   $37.5 million   in exchange for: (a) payment in cash in an amount equal to (i) the aggregate principal amount of such 7% Notes multiplied by   0.6   plus (ii) an amount of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i) at an annual interest rate of 7% per annum, such interest accruing from June 10, 2016 until (and including) the closings of the purchases and computed based on a year of 360 days; (b) payment in cash of interest that accrued in respect of such 7% Notes in accordance with the indenture relating to such 7% Notes but remained unpaid at the closings of the purchases; and (c) delivery to Allianz of Warrants to purchase Common Stock, representing in the aggregate   3.3%   of the outstanding Common Stock as of June 10, 2016. 
    
  In connection with such agreement, during the second quarter of 2016, the Subsidiary Issuer repurchased an aggregate of   $16.5 million   of its 7% Notes for   $10.1 million   and issued an aggregate of   984,342   Warrants. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2016, the Subsidiary Issuer repurchased (the "July 2016 Repurchase") an aggregate of   $21.0 million   of its 7% Notes for   $13.0 million   and issued an aggregate of   1,255,485   Warrants. 
    
  Extinguishments 
    
    In the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $7.4 million   related to the July 2016 Repurchase, of which   $8.4 million   related to a discount on the purchase price, partially offset by the fair value of the Warrants issued of   $0.7 million  , a write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.2 million  , and   $0.1 million   of transaction fees and expenses. The fair value of the Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.

8. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is party to various legal actions that are ordinary and incidental to its business. While the outcome of pending legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the outcome of these various proceedings will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. In the second quarter of   2016  , the Company reached confidential agreements to settle controversies and disputes in connection with certain product warranty litigations. Total expense related to the litigation and associated accruals, recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations was   $1.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  The Company is involved in certain environmental matters and has been designated as a potentially responsible party for certain hazardous waste sites. There have been no material changes related to these environmental matters and, based on information currently available, the Company believes that remediation of these environmental matters will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
  The Company s income, sales and use, and other tax returns are routinely subject to audit by various authorities. The Company is currently under audit related to unclaimed property, which is being led by the state of Delaware and includes other states as well. The Company believes that the resolution of any matters raised during such audits will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or its results of operations.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

The Company participates in a number of multi-employer pension plans for union employees ("Multi-Employer Pension Plans") and is exposed to significant risks and uncertainties arising from its participation in these Multi-Employer Pension Plans. These risks and uncertainties, including changes in future contributions due to partial or full withdrawal of the Company and other participating employers from these Multi-Employer Pension Plans, could significantly increase the Company s future contributions or the underfunded status of these Multi-Employer Pension Plans. Two of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans are in mass withdrawal status. While it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of future actions of the Company or other participating employers in these Multi-Employer Pension Plans, continued participation in or withdrawal from these Multi-Employer Pension Plans could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

9. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are required to be recorded at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is determined based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. There were no assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of   October 1, 2016  . On an annual basis, the Company records its pension plan assets at fair value. No additional assets or liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of   January 2, 2016  . 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

14. Income (Loss) per Share 
    
  On July 8, 2016, the Company announced a Reverse Stock Split of its Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-8, effective July 13, 2016. The Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 14, 2016. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each eight pre-split shares of Common Stock outstanding were automatically combined into one new share of Common Stock without any action on the part of the respective holders. The Reverse Stock Split also applied to Common Stock issuable upon the exchange of the Company s outstanding 7% Notes and upon the exercise of the Company s outstanding warrants and Equity Awards. The share and per share amounts below have been retroactively adjusted to give recognition to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. 
    
  Basic income (loss) per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. When applicable, diluted income (loss) per share is calculated using two approaches. The first approach, the treasury stock method, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if the Equity Awards to issue Common Stock were exercised. The second approach, the if converted method, reflects the potential dilution of the Equity Awards, the 7% Notes and the Warrants being exchanged for Common Stock. Under this method, interest expense associated with the 7% Notes, net of tax, if any, is added back to income from continuing operations and the shares outstanding are increased by the underlying 7% Notes equivalent. 
    
  As of   September 26, 2015  , the effect of approximately   2.5 million   shares related to the exchange of the 7% Notes for Common Stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the effect of approximately   218,000   and   374,000   shares, respectively, related to the issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of Equity Awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the effect of approximately   1.7 million   and   zero   shares, respectively, related to the issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of Warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Business Overview 
    
  We are a diversified manufacturing company focused on print-related products. Our broad portfolio of products primarily includes envelope converting, commercial printing and label manufacturing. We operate a global network of strategically located manufacturing facilities, serving a diverse base of customers. Generally, print-related industries are highly fragmented and extremely competitive due to over-capacity and pricing pressures. We believe these factors will continue to impact our results of operations in the future; however, we believe our focus on our diverse product offerings, our improved cost structure and efforts to improve our capital structure will allow for us to return value to our shareholders. 
    
  Our business strategy has been, and continues to be, focused on improving our operating margins, improving our capital structure and providing quality product offerings to our customers. We also are continuing to review options for our non-strategic assets and product lines. We also continue to make strategic investments and focused capital expenditures. The strategic investments focus on improving our e-commerce customer experience and reinvesting into our equipment base. We believe this strategy has allowed us to diversify our revenue base, maintain our low cost structure and deliver quality product offerings to our customers. 
    
  We operate our business in three complementary reportable segments: the envelope segment, the print segment and the label segment. 

33 

Envelope.   We are the largest envelope manufacturer in North America. Our envelope segment represented approximately   52.4%   and   52.6%   of our net sales for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Our envelope segment offers direct mail products used for customer solicitations and transactional envelopes used for     billing and remittance by end users including financial institutions, insurance companies and telecommunications companies. We also produce a broad line of specialty and stock envelopes which are sold through wholesalers, distributors and national catalogs for the office product markets and office product superstores.  

Print.   We are one of the leading commercial printers in North America. On August 7, 2015, we added to our print operations by acquiring certain assets of Asendia USA, Inc., which we refer to as Asendia. The acquired assets provide letter shop, data processing, bindery and digital printing offerings. Our print segment represented approximately   30.0%   and   29.0%   of our net sales for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Our print segment primarily caters to the consumer products, automotive, travel and leisure and telecommunications industries. We provide a wide array of print offerings to our customers including electronic prepress, digital asset archiving, direct-to-plate technology, high-quality color printing on web and sheet-fed presses, digital printing and content management. The broad selection of print products we produce includes car brochures, annual reports, direct mail products, advertising literature, corporate identity materials and brand marketing materials. Our content management business offers complete solutions, including: editing, content processing, content management, electronic peer review, production, distribution and reprint marketing. 

Label.   We are a leading label manufacturer and one of the largest North American prescription label manufacturers for retail pharmacy chains. Our label segment represented approximately   17.6%   and   18.4%   of our net sales for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Our label segment produces a diverse line of custom labels for a broad range of industries including manufacturing, warehousing, packaging, food and beverage, and health and beauty, which we sell through extensive networks of distributors or within similar resale channels. We provide direct mail and overnight packaging labels, food and beverage labels, and shelf and scale labels for national and regional customers. We produce pressure-sensitive prescription labels for the retail pharmacy chain market. 

Consolidated Operating Results 
    
  This MD A includes an overview of our condensed consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , followed by a discussion of the results of operations of each of our reportable segments for the same periods.  
       
  2016 Overview 
    
  Generally, print-related industries remain highly fragmented and extremely competitive due to over-capacity and pricing pressures. We believe these factors, combined with uncertain economic conditions in the United States, will continue to impact our results of operations. However, we believe the diversification of our revenue and operating income along with the market dynamics that exist within certain markets in which we operate, such as envelope converting, are not as fragmented or competitive as commercial print markets. As such, we believe that our position in specific niche print markets will provide an opportunity for us to have operating trends that perform better than certain other print dynamic markets.  
  Our current management focus is on the following areas: 
    
    Improving Operating Margins 
    
  In 2014, we substantially completed our integration of certain assets of National Envelope Corporation, which we refer to as National, which allowed us to focus on profitability improvement and other cost reduction actions in our envelope platform throughout 2015 and into 2016. We believe the accelerated integration plan we completed during 2014 has provided meaningful improvements in our envelope segment's operating results during 2015 and 2016, as we realized significant increases in gross profit and operating income, as compared to 2014 and prior years. 
    
  During the last two years, we have completed select downsizing and consolidation of our commercial print assets; activities that we believe will allow us to continue to serve a broad range of customers in targeted geographic locations, as well as with our  
  
   34 

national customer base. These consolidations have also allowed us to lower our fixed cost infrastructure within our print operations while expanding our customer experience. 
    
  We also continue to make strategic investments and focused capital expenditures within our labels operations. The strategic investments focus on improving our e-commerce customer experience and reinvesting into our equipment base. The initiation of a multi-phased, multi-year plan to reinvest into state-of-the-art labeling equipment should significantly increase our capabilities, minimize machine downtime and allow for further margin expansion within our label operations. 
    
    Strategic Asset Review 
    
  During 2015, we began actively moving forward with our plan to review and potentially divest certain non-strategic assets. As a result of this strategic review, during the first quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our folded carton and shrink sleeve packaging businesses, along with our one top-sheet lithographic print operation, which we refer to as the Packaging Business. 
    
  During 2015, we also completed two small strategic transactions, which we refer to as the 2015 Label Transactions, which helped facilitate the exit of two non-core product lines reported within our label operating segment. Additionally, on May 2, 2016, in connection with our plan to exit our coating operation that we announced in the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement with a customer to sell certain proprietary rights and specific production equipment used to produce this customer s specific products. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.0 million associated with the sale of the proprietary rights and equipment, which was recorded in other income, net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the second quarter of 2016. As part of this transaction, we also earned production incentives of $3.0 million during the second quarter of 2016 associated with incremental production and delivery targets with this customer, which were recorded in net sales in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. We refer to this transaction as the 2016 Label Transaction. 
    
  We believe there continues to be opportunities for further transactions of various magnitudes given our desire to tighten our management focus and minimize non-core product lines and monetize assets opportunistically. 
    
  Improving our Capital Structure 
    
    Since the beginning of 2012, we have been focused on improving our capital structure through a number of initiatives including working capital improvements, exiting underperforming or non-strategic businesses, and taking advantage of attractive leveraged loan and high yield debt market conditions. In connection with these activities, through the end of 2015, we successfully reduced our outstanding debt and weighted average interest rate, which resulted in annual cash interest savings of approximately $20 million. We have been able to accomplish this while reinvesting cash into our businesses via four acquisitions and focused capital expenditures. 
    
  The sale of the Packaging Business, as well as our continued operational improvements, provided us greater flexibility to address our higher interest rate debt instruments in 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we extinguished $34.5 million of our 7% senior exchangeable notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 7% Notes, and $10.0 million of our 11.5% senior notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 11.5% Notes. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we closed on an exchange offer, which we refer to as the Exchange Offer, whereby approximately 80% of our 11.5% Notes were exchanged for newly issued 6.000% senior notes due 2024, which we refer to as the 6.000% Unsecured Notes, and warrants, which we refer to as the Warrants, to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Cenveo, Inc., which we refer to as the Common Stock, representing 16.6% of our outstanding Common Stock as of June 10, 2016. Each Warrant is currently exercisable for 0.125 shares of Common Stock (as adjusted as a result of the Company s recent reverse stock split). For each $1,000 principal amount of 11.5% Notes exchanged, the holder received $700 aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Unsecured Notes and Warrants to purchase 9.25 shares of Common Stock. The retired 11.5% Notes represented approximately 80% of all such notes outstanding at the commencement of the Exchange Offer. Upon closing the Exchange Offer, we emerged with lower overall debt, stronger cash flow due to significantly lower future interest expense, and no significant scheduled debt maturities until August 2019. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we completed the last transactions contemplated by the Support Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2016, which we refer to as the Support Agreement, pursuant to which Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, which we refer to as Allianz, agreed to, among other things, tender and sell to us all of the 7% Notes owned by Allianz, which we refer to as the 7% Note Purchases, in the aggregate principal amount of $37.5 million in exchange for: (a) payment in cash in an amount equal to (i) the aggregate principal amount of such 7% Notes multiplied by 0.6 plus (ii) an amount of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i) at an annual interest rate of 7% per annum, such interest accruing from  
  
   35 

June 10, 2016 until (and including) the closings of the purchases and computed based on a year of 360 days; (b) payment in cash of interest that shall have accrued in respect of such 7% Notes in accordance with the indenture relating to such 7% Notes but remained unpaid at the closings of the purchases; and (c) delivery to Allianz of Warrants to purchase Common Stock, representing in the aggregate 3.3% of the outstanding Common Stock as of June 10, 2016. 
    
  In connection with such agreement, during the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of $16.5 million of 7% Notes for $10.1 million and issued an aggregate of 984,342 Warrants. During the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of $21.0 million of 7% Notes, which we refer to as the July 2016 Repurchase, for $13.0 million and issued an aggregate of 1,255,485 Warrants.  
    
  Concurrent with the above transactions, we amended our asset-based revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the ABL Facility, to, among other things, extend its term through 2021 and reduce the commitments thereunder by $50 million to $190 million, which we refer to as the ABL Amendment No. 4. The ABL Facility now matures in June 2021, with a springing maturity of May 2019 ahead of our existing 6.000% senior priority secured notes due 2019, which we refer to as the 6.000% Secured Notes, in the event that more than $10 million of the 6.000% Secured Notes remain outstanding at such time. On the same date, we entered into a secured indenture and note purchase agreement with Allianz pursuant to which we issued new secured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million bearing interest at 4% per annum, which we refer to as the 4% Secured Notes. We applied the proceeds to reduce the outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility. The 4% Secured Notes mature in December 2021. 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we extinguished   $5.7 million   of our 7% Notes at par. After these transactions, approximately $5.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Notes remain outstanding. 
    
  As a result of the above transactions, we expect to realize additional annualized cash interest savings in excess of $20 million in 2017 as compared to 2015. 
    
  Provide Quality Product Offerings 
    
  We conduct regular reviews of our product offerings, manufacturing processes and distribution methods to ensure that they meet the changing needs of our customers. We have recently made, and expect to continue to make, technology investments that enhance our sales organization's ability to offer our customers a product that allows them to manage their programs from content through distribution. We believe our multi-product offerings along with the advancement of our current technology platform will allow us to penetrate deeper into our customer s supply chains. Additionally, with the acquisition of Asendia on August 7, 2015, we added letter shop, data processing, bindery and digital print offerings to our commercial printing operations, all of which are areas we believe add value to our capabilities of serving our customer s needs in-house. Lastly, we are also investing in digital and variable technology as we have seen increased customer demand for these technologies. By expanding our product offerings, we intend to increase cross-selling opportunities to our existing customer base and mitigate the impact of any decline in a given market or product. 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  During 2015, we began actively moving forward with our plan to review and potentially divest certain non-strategic assets. As a result of this strategic review, during the first quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our Packaging Business. The financial results of the Packaging Business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. Our historical, condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give recognition to the discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations. 
    
    Reportable Segments 
    
  We operate three complementary reportable segments: envelope, print and label. Prior to the disposition of the Packaging Business, we operated four operating segments: envelope, print, label and packaging. Based upon similar economic characteristics and management reporting, prior to the disposition of the Packaging Business, we previously aggregated the label and packaging operating segments to have a total of three reportable segments: envelope, print, and label and packaging. 
    
  See below for a summary of net sales and operating income (loss) for our reportable segments that we use internally to assess our operating performance. Our   three and nine   month reporting periods each consisted of 13 and 39 weeks, respectively, and ended on   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  . 
  
   36 

37 

Net Sales 
    
  Net sales   decreased     $13.8 million  , or   3.3%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Sales in our envelope segment   decreased     $5.9 million  , sales in our label segment   decreased     $5.8 million   and sales in our print segment   decreased     $2.1 million  . 
    
  Net sales   decreased     $20.1 million  , or   1.6%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . Sales in our label segment   decreased     $10.5 million   and sales in our envelope segment   decreased     $9.9 million  , partially offset by   increased   sales in our print segment of   $0.4 million  . 
    
  See Segment Operations below for a detailed discussion of the primary factors affecting the change in our net sales by reportable segment. 

Operating Income 
    
  Operating income   increased     $1.4 million  , or   7.0%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This   increase   was due to an   increase   in operating income of   $3.9 million   from our print segment and a   decrease   in corporate expenses of   $1.7 million  . These increases in operating income were partially offset by a   decrease   in operating income from our label segment of   $3.4 million   and a   decrease   in operating income from our envelope segment of   $0.9 million  .  
    
  Operating income   increased     $0.5 million  , or   0.8%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . This   increase   was due to an   increase   in operating income of   $4.5 million   from our print segment, an   increase   in operating income from our envelope segment of   $2.3 million   and a   decrease   in corporate expenses of   $1.3 million  , partially offset by a   decrease   in operating income from our label segment of   $7.6 million  . 
    
  See Segment Operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in operating income by reportable segment. 

Interest Expense  
    
  Interest expense   decreased     $4.8 million   to   $20.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $25.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to the Exchange Offer; the partial retirement of our 11.5% Notes during 2015 and   2016   and the partial retirement of our 7% Notes during   2016  . Interest expense in the   third   quarter of   2016   reflected average outstanding debt of approximately $1.1 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 6.6%. This compares to average outstanding debt of approximately $1.2 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 7.3% in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
    
  Interest expense   decreased     $10.1 million   to   $65.9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to   $76.0 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to the Exchange Offer, the partial retirement of our 11.5% Notes during 2015 and   2016   and the partial retirement of our 7% Notes during   2016  . Interest expense in the first   nine   months of   2016   reflected average outstanding debt of approximately $1.1 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 6.9%. This compares to average outstanding debt of approximately $1.2 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 7.3% in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  We expect interest expense for the remainder of   2016   will be lower than the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the Exchange Offer and the partial retirement of our 11.5% Notes and our 7% Notes.  

(Gain) Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $7.4 million   related to the July 2016 Repurchase, of which   $8.4 million   related to a discount on the purchase price, partially offset by the fair value of the Warrants issued of   $0.7 million  , a write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.2 million  , and   $0.1 million   of transaction fees and expenses. The fair value of the Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. 
    
  In the second quarter of   2016  , we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $46.1 million   related to the Exchange Offer, of which   $49.6 million   related to a discount on the difference of the net carrying value of the extinguished 11.5% Notes and the fair value of the new 6.000% Unsecured Notes, partially offset by a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.8 million  , a write-off of original issuance discount of   $1.2 million   and   $1.5 million   of transaction fees and expenses.  
  
   38 

Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $5.4 million   related to the repurchase of   $16.5 million   of our 7% Notes, of which   $6.0 million   related to a discount on the purchase price, partially offset by   $0.5 million   in fees paid to lenders, and a write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  Lastly, during the second quarter of 2016, in connection with ABL Amendment No. 4, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.2 million   related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
    
  In the first quarter of   2016  , we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $16.5 million   related to the repurchase of   $34.5 million   of our 7% Notes, of which   $16.8 million   related to a discount on the purchase price, partially offset by a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.3 million  . Additionally, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $5.1 million   related to the repurchase of   $10.0 million   of our 11.5% Notes, of which   $5.3 million   related to a discount on the purchase, partially offset by a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.1 million   and a write-off of original issuance discount of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  In the second quarter of   2015  , we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   related to the repurchase of   $6.8 million   of our 11.5% Notes. 
    
  In the first quarter of   2015  , we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.4 million   related to the repurchase of   $15.8 million   of our 11.5% Notes, of which   $0.2 million   related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, and   $0.2 million   related to the write-off of original issuance discount. 
    
  We recognized a total gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $7.4 million   and   $80.3 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, and a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of   zero   and   $0.6 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 

Other Income, Net 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recognized other income, net, of   $1.7 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively. This is primarily comprised of a gain of approximately   $2.1 million   recognized in connection with a sale of a manufacturing facility within our envelope segment during the third quarter of 2016 and a gain of approximately $2.0 million during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the 2016 Label Transaction, partially offset by non-operating expenses.   
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , we recognized other income, net, of   $1.3 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively. Other income, net, for both periods in 2015 is primarily related to cash proceeds of $2.2 million received during the third quarter of 2015 related to the 2015 Label Transactions. 

Income Taxes 

39 

Income Tax Expense 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we had an income tax expense of   $1.0 million  , compared to an income tax benefit of   $0.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The tax expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   and the tax benefit for the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily related to income taxes on our domestic operations.  
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we had an income tax expense of   $4.1 million  , compared to an income tax benefit of   $1.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The tax expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   and the tax benefit for the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily related to income taxes on our domestic operations.  
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   2016   and   2015   differed from the federal statutory rate, primarily as a result of having a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. We do not believe our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly for the remainder of   2016  . Our federal tax loss carryforward at the end of the   third   quarter 2016 was $207.2 million after utilization of $125.3 million during the first   nine   months of   2016  , primarily due to the gain on early extinguishment of debt and the sale of our Packaging Business. 
    
  Valuation Allowance 
    
  We review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, and therefore the need for valuation allowances, on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence. The factors considered in our determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to: recent historical financial results, historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies. If, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. 
    
  Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. In the United States, our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis. While there are significant impairment, restructuring and refinancing charges driving our cumulative three year loss, this is considered significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable and, therefore, difficult to overcome. However, the three year loss position is not solely determinative and accordingly, we consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis. During the current year, we have recorded significant taxable income as a result of our debt refinancing and repurchases during the first   nine   months of   2016  , as well as the sale of our Packaging Business in the first quarter of 2016. Although significant taxable income will be realized during the current year related to these transactions, we considered our remaining operations to currently not rise to the level needed in order to overcome the negative evidence from the recent prior years to merit the reversal of the valuation allowance completely. Based upon our analysis, we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in the United States will not be fully realized in the future. Accordingly, we have a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets of $131.6 million as of   October 1, 2016  . Our valuation allowance declined $31.6 million from   January 2, 2016  , primarily due to the gain on early extinguishment of debt and the sale of our Packaging Business. We will continue to closely monitor our position with respect to the full realization of our net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowances on those assets and make adjustments as needed in the future as our facts and circumstances dictate. 
    
       There is no corresponding income tax benefit recognized with respect to losses incurred and no corresponding income tax expense recognized with respect to earnings generated in jurisdictions with a valuation allowance. This causes variability in our effective tax rate. We intend to maintain the valuation allowances until it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. If operating results improve on a sustained basis, or if certain tax planning strategies are implemented, our conclusions regarding the need for valuation allowances could change, resulting in the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowances in the future, which could have a significant impact on income tax expense or benefit in the period recognized and subsequent periods. 

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes 
       
  On January 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our Packaging Business. We received total cash proceeds of approximately   $88.1 million  , net of transaction costs of   $6.3 million  . This resulted in the recognition of a total pre-tax loss of   $5.1 million  , of which a gain of   $1.2 million   and a loss of   $0.1 million   were recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  ,  
  
   40 

respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash loss on the sale of discontinued operations of   $5.0 million  . The loss was based on the executed purchase agreement and the net assets of the Packaging Business. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of   $9.9 million   related to this transaction. In addition to the proceeds,   $5.0 million   of purchase price consideration has been held in escrow and will be paid to us subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   income   from discontinued operations was   $0.7 million  , primarily attributable to the receipt of a portion of the purchase price consideration held in escrow. 
       
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   loss   from discontinued operations was   $4.4 million  , primarily comprised of: (i) a loss from operations of   $3.0 million   primarily from our Packaging Business; (ii) a loss on sale of our Packaging Business of   $0.1 million  ; and (iii) tax expense of   $1.4 million  . 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2015  ,   income   from discontinued operations was   $0.3 million  , primarily comprised of income from operations of our Packaging Business of   $0.9 million   and tax expense of   $0.5 million  .  
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2015  ,   income   from discontinued operations was   $1.8 million  , primarily comprised of income from operations of our Packaging Business of   $3.2 million   and tax expense of   $1.4 million  .  

Segment Operations 
    
  Our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of the ongoing operations of our three reportable segments. We assess performance based on net sales and operating income.  

Envelope 

Segment Net Sales 
    
  Segment net sales for our envelope segment   decreased     $5.9 million  , or   2.7%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   decreased     $9.9 million  , or   1.5%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . These decreases were primarily due to: (i) lower sales volumes in our office products business line, primarily due to marketplace trends and certain customer inventory rationalization programs resulting in lower demand; and (ii) lower sales volumes from our wholesale and generic transactional envelope products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volumes within our direct mail platform, primarily driven by financial institutions. 

Segment Operating Income 
    
  Segment operating income for our envelope segment   decreased     $0.9 million  , or   5.2%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to: (i) lower gross margin of $1.0 million primarily due to lower sales volumes from office products, wholesale and generic transactional products partially offset by higher sales volumes from direct mail products; and (ii) higher restructuring and other charges of   $0.3 million   due to overhead cost eliminations implemented during the   third   quarter of   2016  . These decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.4 million primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and lower commission expense due to lower sales volumes. 

41 

Segment operating income for our envelope segment   increased     $2.3 million  , or   4.7%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to (i) lower restructuring and other charges of   $2.1 million  , primarily related to charges associated with the integration of certain assets of National with our operations in 2015; and (ii) lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.6 million primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and lower sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower gross margin of $0.4 million primarily due to lower sales volumes. 

Print 

Segment Net Sales 
    
  Segment net sales for our print segment   decreased     $2.1 million  , or   1.7%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to: (i) lower sales volumes in our commercial print group, primarily driven by consumer products and educational customers and our publisher services group; and (ii) continued pricing pressures. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) higher sales volumes with our financial institution customers; and (ii) net sales generated from Asendia, as Asendia was only included in our 2015 results beginning on August 7, 2015, the date of acquisition.  
    
  Segment net sales for our print segment   increased     $0.4 million  , or   0.1%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . These increases were primarily due to: (i) increased sales volume within our commercial print group, primarily driven by financial institutions; and (ii) net sales generated from Asendia, as Asendia was only included in our 2015 results beginning on August 7, 2015, the date of acquisition. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales volumes in our publisher services group and continued pricing pressures. 

Segment Operating Income 
    
  Segment operating income for our print segment   increased     $3.9 million  , or   253.4%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase was primarily due to: (i) lower restructuring and other charges of   $4.0 million   due to the closure of a print facility during 2015; and (ii) higher gross margin of $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.7 million. 
    
  Segment operating income for our print segment   increased     $4.5 million  , or   73.3%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase was primarily due to lower restructuring and other charges of   $5.0 million   due to the closure of a print facility during 2015, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.7 million. Gross margin remained relatively flat. 

Label  

42 

Segment Net Sales 
    
  Segment net sales for our label segment   decreased     $5.8 million  , or   7.5%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to: (i) lower sales of $4.7 million related to the exit of our coating operation; and (ii) volume declines within certain of our existing long run label customers due to item rationalization. 
    
  Segment net sales for our label segment   decreased     $10.5 million  , or   4.4%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to: (i) lower sales of $6.5 million related to the exit of our coating operation; and (ii) volume declines within certain of our existing long run label customers, partially offset by: (i) increased volume within our custom label business, primarily due to our e-commerce initiatives; and (ii) one-time production incentives of $3.0 million related to the exit of our coating operation. 

Segment Operating Income 
    
  Segment operating income for our label segment   decreased     $3.4 million  , or   33.3%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to: (i) lower gross margin of $2.8 million primarily due to the exit of our coating operation and lower sales volumes; and (ii) higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 million primarily due to higher information technology depreciation and advertising expenses related to our e-commerce initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by lower amortization expense of $0.5 million due to an intangible asset being fully amortized during   2016  . 
    
  Segment operating income for our label segment   decreased     $7.6 million  , or   24.6%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to: (i) higher restructuring and other charges of   $3.7 million   related to our plans to exit our coating operation and the write down of an investment; (ii) higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.2 million, primarily due to higher information technology depreciation expense related to our e-commerce initiatives; and (iii) the impact on our gross margin due to the exit of our coating operation and lower sales volumes. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) production incentives of $3.0 million related to the exit of our coating operation; and (ii) decreased amortization expense of $1.3 million due to an intangible asset being fully amortized during   2016  . 

Corporate Expenses 
    
  Corporate expenses   decreased     $1.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   decreased     $1.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . These decreases were primarily due to: (i) lower selling, general and administrative expenses due to cost reduction initiatives; and (ii) income generated from our transition services agreement in connection with the sale of our Packaging Business. The decreases in corporate expenses were partially offset by increased restructuring and other charges due to overhead cost eliminations implemented during the   third   quarter of   2016  . 

Restructuring and Other Charges 
    
  Restructuring 
    
  We currently have two active cost savings, restructuring and integration plans, which are related to the implementation of cost savings initiatives focused on overhead cost eliminations, including headcount reductions and the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. We refer to these plans as the 2016 Plan and the 2015 Plan. During the first quarter of 2016, we began implementing the 2016 Plan and continued the 2015 Plan.  
    
  During 2015, we integrated certain assets of National, which we refer to as the National Plan, by completing the closure and consolidation of nine manufacturing facilities into our existing envelope operations and two new facilities.  
    
  We also currently have certain residual cost savings, restructuring and integration plans, which we refer to as the Residual Plans. As a result of these cost savings actions, over the last several years we have closed or consolidated a significant amount of manufacturing facilities and have had a significant number of headcount reductions. We do not anticipate any significant future expenses related to the Residual Plans, other than modifications to current assumptions for lease terminations, multi-employer pension withdrawal liabilities and ongoing expenses related to maintaining restructured assets. 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , as a result of our restructuring and integration activities, we incurred   $2.4 million   of restructuring and other charges, which included   $2.0 million   of employee separation costs, multi-employer pension withdrawal expenses of   $0.2 million  , and building clean-up and other expenses of   $0.2 million  . 
  
   43 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , as a result of our restructuring and integration activities, we incurred   $8.3 million   of restructuring and other charges, which included   $2.9 million   of employee separation costs,   $2.4 million   of net non-cash charges on long-lived assets,   $0.3 million   of equipment moving expenses,   $0.2 million   of lease termination expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawal expenses of   $0.8 million  , and building clean-up and other expenses of   $1.7 million  .  
       
  During the   third   quarter of   2015  , as a result of our restructuring and integration activities, we incurred   $5.5 million   of restructuring and other charges, which included   $0.7 million   of employee separation costs,   $0.1 million   of equipment moving expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawal expenses of   $4.2 million  , and building clean-up and other expenses of   $0.4 million  . 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , as a result of our restructuring and integration activities, we incurred   $11.5 million   of restructuring and other charges, which included   $2.4 million   of employee separation costs,   $2.1 million   of net non-cash charges on long-lived assets,   $0.2 million   of equipment moving expenses,   $0.4 million   of lease termination expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawal expenses of   $4.6 million  , and building clean-up and other expenses of   $1.9 million  . 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , our total restructuring liability was   $20.2 million  , of which   $4.3 million   is included in other current liabilities and   $15.9 million  , which is expected to be paid through 2032, is included in other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Our multi-employer pension withdrawal liabilities are   $18.1 million   of our remaining restructuring liabilities. We believe these liabilities represent our anticipated ultimate withdrawal liabilities; however, we are exposed to significant risks and uncertainties arising from our participation in these multi-employer pension plans. While it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of our future actions or the future actions of other participating employers from the multi-employer pension plans for which we have exited, our anticipated ultimate withdrawal liabilities may be significantly impacted in the future due to lower future contributions or increased withdrawals from other participating employers. 
    
  Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments 
    
  There were no goodwill or intangible asset impairments recorded in the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   September 26, 2015  .  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities of Continuing Operations.   Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was   $13.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , primarily due to: (i) a source of cash from accounts receivables due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers; (ii) lower inventories as a result of our inventory management programs and (iii) our net income of   $68.2 million   adjusted for non-cash items of   $28.6 million  , primarily our gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $80.3 million  , offset by depreciation and amortization expense of   $35.5 million  . These inflows were partially offset by a use of cash of   $64.0 million   from (i) accounts payable primarily resulting from the timing of vendor payments due to lower volumes and (ii) other working capital changes, primarily resulting from the timing of customer related liabilities and lower freight activity due to lower volumes.  
    
   Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was   $1.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to our net loss of   $13.3 million   adjusted for non-cash items of   $47.9 million  , partially offset by: (i) a use of cash of   $23.1 million   from working capital; and (ii) pension and other postretirement plan contributions of $5.6 million. The use of cash from working capital primarily resulted from: (i) a use of cash from inventory, due to the timing of orders from our customers; and (ii) the timing of interest payments on our long-term debt and timing of payments to our vendors, partially offset by a source of cash from accounts receivables due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers. 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities is generally sufficient to meet daily disbursement needs. On days when our cash receipts exceed disbursements, we reduce our credit facility balance or place excess funds in conservative, short-term investments until there is an opportunity to pay down debt. On days when our cash disbursements exceed cash receipts, we use invested cash balances and/or our credit facility to fund the difference. As a result, our daily credit facility balance fluctuates depending on working capital needs. Regardless, at all times we believe we have sufficient liquidity available to us to fund our cash needs. 
    
  Net Cash (Used In) Provided By Operating Activities of Discontinued Operations.   Represents the net cash used in or provided by operating activities of our Discontinued Operations. 

Net Cash Used In Investing Activities of Continuing Operations.   Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was   $20.9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , primarily due to capital expenditures of   $31.2 million  , offset by  
  
   44 

proceeds of   $8.3 million   from the sale of property, plant and equipment and proceeds of $2.0 million related to the 2016 Label Transactions. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was   $17.6 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily resulting from capital expenditures of   $19.2 million   and $2.0 million of cash used in the acquisition of Asendia during the third quarter of 2015. This was partially offset by cash proceeds from the 2015 Label Transactions of $2.2 million, and the sale of property, plant and equipment of   $1.5 million  . 
    
  We estimate that we will spend approximately $35.0 to $45.0 million on capital expenditures in   2016  , after considering proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Our primary sources for our capital expenditures are cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and financing capacity within our current debt arrangements. We plan to make additional investments in the business of our Company during 2016 using proceeds from the sale of our Packaging Business. 
    
  Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities of Discontinued Operations.   Represents the net cash used in or provided by our Discontinued Operations related to investing activities. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the cash provided by discontinued investing activities of   $94.4 million   is comprised of gross cash proceeds received related to the sale of our Packaging Business. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2015  , the cash used in discontinued investing activities of   $1.9 million   is comprised of capital expenditures made by our Packaging Business.  

Net Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities.   Net cash used by financing activities of continuing operations was   $82.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   primarily due to: (i) net repayments of   $73.1 million   under our ABL Facility; (ii) cash paid of   $40.2 million   related to the extinguishment of   $72.1 million   of our 7% Notes; (iii) financing-related costs and expenses of   $10.0 million  , primarily related to the Exchange Offer; (iv) cash paid of   $4.7 million   related to the extinguishment of   $10.0 million   of our 11.5% Notes; and (iv) various repayments on other long-term debt totaling   $4.1 million  , partially offset by proceeds of $50.0 million from the 4% Secured Notes during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was   $2.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to net borrowings of   $30.4 million   under our ABL Facility, partially offset by: (i) the extinguishment of $22.6 million of our 11.5% Notes; (ii) various repayments on other long-term debt totaling   $3.3 million  ; and (iii) the payment of   $1.3 million   of financing-related costs and expenses. 
    
  Net Cash Used In Financing Activities of Discontinued Operations.   Represents the net cash used in financing activities of our Discontinued Operations. 

Long-Term Debt.   Our total outstanding long-term debt, including current maturities, was approximately   $1.0 billion   as of   October 1, 2016  , a decrease of   $164.5 million   from   January 2, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to: (i) the Exchange Offer, which resulted in a decrease of $62.6 million in debt, net of capitalized debt issuance costs and original issuance discount; (ii) net repayments of   $73.1 million   under our ABL Facility during the first   nine   months of   2016  ; (iii) the extinguishment of   $72.1 million   of our 7% Notes during the first   nine   months of 2016; and (iv) the first quarter extinguishment of   $10.0 million   of our 11.5% Notes, all of which is partially offset by the issuance of our 4% Secured Notes. As of   October 1, 2016  , approximately 93% of our debt outstanding was subject to fixed interest rates. As of October 31, 2016, we had approximately $91.7 million of borrowing availability under our ABL Facility. From time to time, we may seek to refinance our debt obligations, or purchase our outstanding notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
    
  Letters of Credit 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $17.7 million related to performance and payment guarantees. Based on our experience with these arrangements, we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant. 

45 

Credit Ratings 
    
  Our current credit ratings are as follows: 

In June 2016, Moody's Investors Services, which we refer to as Moody's, upgraded our Corporate Rating and the ratings on our 6.000% Secured Notes and 8.500% Notes. Additionally, Moody's affirmed the ratings on our 11.5% Notes. In July 2016, Standard   Poor's Ratings Services, which we refer to as Standard   Poor's, upgraded our Corporate Rating, rated our 6.000% Unsecured Notes for the first time and withdrew the rating on our 11.5% Notes. Additionally, the ratings on our 6.000% Notes and 8.500% Notes remained unchanged. The detail of all current ratings has been provided in the table above. 
  The terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding availability or influence our daily operations, including planned capital expenditures. We do not believe that our current ratings will unduly influence our ability to raise additional capital if and/or when needed. Some of our constituents closely track rating agency actions and would note any raising or lowering of our credit ratings; however, we believe that along with reviewing our credit ratings, additional quantitative and qualitative analysis must be performed to accurately judge our financial condition. 
       
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under our long-term debt.  
    
  We expect that our internally generated cash flows and financing available under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs for the next twelve months; however, this cannot be assured. 

Seasonality    
  Our envelope market and certain segments of the direct mail market have historically experienced seasonality with a higher percentage of volume of products sold to these markets during the third and fourth quarters of the year, primarily related to back-to-school campaigns and holiday purchases.  
  Our print plants experience seasonal variations. Revenues associated with consumer publications, such as holiday catalogs and automobile brochures tend to be concentrated from July through October. Revenues associated with the educational and scholastic market and promotional materials tend to decline in the summer. As a result of these seasonal variations, some of our print operations operate at or near capacity at certain times throughout the year.  
  Our custom label business has historically experienced a seasonal increase in net sales during the first and second quarters of the year, primarily resulting from the release of our product catalogs to the trade channel customers and our customers  spring advertising campaigns. Our prescription label business has historically experienced seasonality in net sales due to cold and flu seasons, generally concentrated in the fourth and first quarters of the year. As a result of these seasonal variations, some of our label operations operate at or near capacity at certain times throughout the year.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had variable rate debt outstanding of   $75.1 million  . A change of 1% to the current London Interbank Offered Rate would have a minimal impact to our interest expense. 
    
  Our changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities. Subsequent to the sale of the Packaging Business on January 19, 2016, we have minimal exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , a uniform 10% strengthening of the United States dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have had a minimal impact to our sales and operating income.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) as of   October 1, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 1, 2016  , in order to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016  , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time we may be involved in claims or lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business. Accruals for claims or lawsuits have been provided for to the extent that losses are deemed probable and estimable. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims or lawsuits cannot be ascertained, on the basis of present information and advice received from counsel, it is our opinion that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims or lawsuits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In the case of administrative proceedings related to environmental matters involving governmental authorities, we do not believe that any imposition of monetary damages or fines would be material. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
