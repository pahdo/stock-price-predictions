  Note   1  : Ownership, Description of Business, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Encore Capital Group, Inc. ( Encore ), through its subsidiaries (collectively with Encore, the  Company ), is an international specialty finance company providing debt recovery solutions for consumers across a broad range of financial assets. The Company purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and manages them by working with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery. Defaulted receivables are consumers  unpaid financial commitments to credit originators, including banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, commercial retailers, and telecommunication companies. Defaulted receivables may also include receivables subject to bankruptcy proceedings. 
  Financial Statement Preparation and Presentation 
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). 
  In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the Company s financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, and reflect the accounts and operations of the Company and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The Company also consolidates VIEs, for which it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity s economic performance, and (b) either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits. Refer to Note   11  ,  Variable Interest Entity,  for further details. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  Translation of Foreign Currencies 
  The financial statements of certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using their local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during each period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates, except for the change in retained earnings during the year which is the result of the income statement translation process. Intercompany transaction gains or losses at each period end arising from subsequent measurement of balances for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future are included as translation adjustments and recorded within other comprehensive income or loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in other income or expense. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to the condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ). The FASB issued ASU 2016-15 to decrease the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash

     Table of Contents  

flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 applies a current expected credit loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model, an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost. The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The expected credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, will be recorded through an allowance account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected. Most importantly, the standard eliminates the current accounting model for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality, which provides authoritative guidance for the accounting of the Company s investment in receivable portfolios. Under this new standard, entities will gross up the initial amortized cost for the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, the initial amortized cost will be the sum of (1) the purchase price and (2) the estimate of credit losses as of the date of acquisition. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships ( ASU 2016-05 ) and ASU 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments ( ASU 2016-06 ). ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-06 clarifies the steps required to determine bifurcation of an embedded derivative. ASU 2016-05 and ASU 2016-06 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 changes accounting for leases and requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from all leases, including those classified as operating leases under previous accounting guidance, on the balance sheet and requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Change in Accounting Principle 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 was effective beginning January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 and the retrospective application of this change in accounting principle on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 reclassified debt issuance costs of   $41.7 million  , which were previously presented as other assets, as a reduction to the carrying value of the debt by the same amount. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows in any period. 
   
  Note   2  : Discontinued Operations 
  On March 31, 2016, the Company completed its previously announced divestiture of its membership interests in Propel Acquisition LLC ( Propel ) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), dated February 19,

     Table of Contents  

2016, among the Company and certain funds affiliated with Prophet Capital Asset Management LP. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the application of the purchase price formula resulted in cash consideration paid to the Company at closing of   $144.4 million   (net proceeds were   $106.0 million   after divestiture of   $38.4 million   in cash), subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized a loss of   $3.0 million   related to the sale of Propel. Propel represented the Company s entire tax lien business reportable segment. Propel s operations are presented as discontinued operations in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Certain immaterial costs that may be eliminated as a result of the sale remained in continuing operations.  
  The following table presents the results of the discontinued operations during the periods presented (  in thousands  ): 

Note   3  : Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
  Basic earnings or loss per share is calculated by dividing net earnings or loss attributable to Encore by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, restricted stock, and the dilutive effect of the convertible senior notes. In computing the diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, dilutive potential common shares are excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation because of their anti-dilutive effect. 
  A reconciliation of shares used in calculating earnings per basic and diluted shares follows   (in thousands)  : 

Anti-dilutive employee stock options outstanding were zero or negligible during the periods presented above.  
   
  Note   4  : Business Combinations 
  dlc Acquisition 
  On June 1, 2015, Encore s U.K.-based subsidiary Cabot Credit Management Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Cabot ) acquired Hillesden Securities Ltd and its subsidiaries ( dlc ), a U.K.-based acquirer and collector of non-performing unsecured consumer debt for approximately    180.6 million   (approximately   $274.7 million  ), (the  dlc Acquisition ).  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

The dlc Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Fair value measurements have been applied based on assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the respective assets and liabilities.  
  The components of the purchase price allocation for the dlc Acquisition were as follows   (in thousands)  : 

The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to synergies that are expected to be achieved by combining dlc and Cabot's existing contingent collections operations. The entire goodwill of   $66.5 million   related to the dlc Acquisition is   no  t deductible for income tax purposes. 
  Other Acquisitions 
  In addition to the dlc Acquisition discussed above, the Company, through its subsidiaries, completed certain other acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. These acquisitions were immaterial to the Company s financial statements individually and in the aggregate. 
  Refer to Note 2,  Business Combinations  as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a complete description of the Company s acquisition activities in 2015. 
   
  Note   5  : Fair Value Measurements 
  The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (  i.e.,   the  exit price ). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of each level: 
             
    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs, including inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions.

     Table of Contents  

Financial Instruments Required To Be Carried At Fair Value 
  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below   (in thousands)  : 

Derivative Contracts: 
  The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Fair values of these derivative instruments are estimated using industry standard valuation models. These models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. 
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests: 
  Some minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries of the Company have the right, at certain times, to require the Company to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value and, in some cases, to force a sale of the subsidiary if the Company chooses not to purchase their interests at fair value. The noncontrolling interests subject to these arrangements are included in temporary equity as redeemable noncontrolling interests, and are adjusted to their estimated redemption amounts each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a  floor  amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded. The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level. These adjustments do not affect the calculation of earnings per share.  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

The components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following table   (in thousands)  : 

Financial Instruments Not Required To Be Carried At Fair Value 
  Investment in Receivable Portfolios: 
  The Company records its investment in receivable portfolios at cost, which represents a significant discount from the contractual receivable balances due. The Company computes the fair value of its investment in receivable portfolios using Level 3 inputs by discounting the estimated future cash flows generated by its proprietary forecasting models. The key inputs include the estimated future gross cash flow, average cost to collect, and discount rate. In accordance with authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements, the Company estimates the average cost to collect and discount rates based on its estimate of what a market participant might use in valuing these portfolios. The determination of such inputs requires significant judgment, including assessing the assumed market participant s cost structure, its determination of whether to include fixed costs in its valuation, its collection strategies, and determining the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The Company evaluates the use of these key inputs on an ongoing basis and refines the data as it continues to obtain better information from market participants in the debt recovery and purchasing business.  
  In the Company s current analysis, the estimated blended market participant cost to collect and discount rate is approximately   50.3%   and   10.5%  , respectively, for U.S. portfolios, approximately   29.9%   and   11.9%  , respectively, for Europe portfolios and approximately   32.9%   and   11.0%  , respectively for other geographies. Using this method, the fair value of investment in receivable portfolios was approximately   $2,165.0 million   and   $2,473.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as compared to the carrying value of   $2,397.83 million   and   $2,440.67 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. A   100 basis point   fluctuation in the cost to collect and discount rate used would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of U.S. and European portfolios by approximately   $44.3 million   and   $58.6 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . This fair value calculation does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company or the amount that could be realized if its investment in receivable portfolios were sold. 
  Deferred Court Costs: 
  The Company capitalizes deferred court costs and provides a reserve for those costs that it believes will ultimately be uncollectible. The carrying value of net deferred court costs approximates fair value. 
  Debt: 
  The majority of Encore and its subsidiaries  borrowings are carried at historical amounts, adjusted for additional borrowings less principal repayments, which approximate fair value. These borrowings include Encore s senior secured notes and borrowings under its revolving credit and term loan facilities, Cabot s senior secured notes and borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and other borrowing under revolving credit facilities at certain of the Company s subsidiaries. 
  Encore s convertible senior notes are carried at historical cost, adjusted for the debt discount. The carrying value of the convertible senior notes was   $414.0 million   and   $406.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value estimate for these convertible senior notes, which incorporates quoted market prices using Level 2 inputs, was approximately   $382.8 million   and   $372.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

Cabot s senior secured notes are carried at historical cost, adjusted for debt discount and debt premium. The carrying value of Cabot s senior secured notes was   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value estimate for these senior notes, which incorporates quoted market prices using Level 2 inputs, was   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The Company s preferred equity certificates are legal obligations to the noncontrolling shareholders of certain subsidiaries. They are carried at the face amount, plus any accrued interest. The Company determined that the carrying value of these preferred equity certificates approximated fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
   
  Note   6  : Derivatives and Hedging Instruments  
  The Company may periodically enter into derivative financial instruments to manage risks related to interest rates and foreign currency. Certain of the Company s derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging.  
  The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments as recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of financial condition   (in thousands)  :

The Company has operations in foreign countries, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties. The Company adjusts the level and use of derivatives as soon as practicable after learning that an exposure has changed and reviews all exposures and derivative positions on an ongoing basis. 
  Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  Certain of the foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of such contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in OCI are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect the Company s earnings. If all or a portion of the forecasted transaction is cancelled, this would render all or a portion of the cash flow hedge ineffective and the Company would reclassify the ineffective portion of the hedge into earnings. The Company generally does not experience ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship and the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any such gains or losses. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total notional amount of the forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments was   $33.6 million  . All of these outstanding contracts qualified for hedge accounting treatment. The Company estimates that approximately   $0.2 million   of net derivative gain included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.   No   gains or losses were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  In 2016, Encore and its Cabot subsidiary collectively began entering into currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the British Pound and Euro. These derivative contracts generally mature within one to three months and are not designated as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. The Company continues to monitor the level of exposure of the foreign currency exchange risk and may enter into additional short-term forward contracts on an ongoing basis. The gains or losses on these derivative contracts are recognized in other income or expense based on the changes in fair value. Before the effect of income tax and noncontrolling interest, the net gain on these derivative contracts recognized in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations was   $3.3 million   and   $10.7 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.

  Note   7  : Investment in Receivable Portfolios, Net 
  In accordance with the authoritative guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality, discrete receivable portfolio purchases during the same fiscal quarter are aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics. Common risk characteristics include risk ratings (e.g. FICO or similar scores), financial asset type, collateral type, size, interest rate, date of origination, term, and geographic location. The Company s static pools are typically grouped into credit card and telecom, purchased consumer bankruptcy, and mortgage portfolios. The Company further groups these static pools by geographic region or location. Portfolios acquired in business combinations are also grouped into these pools. During any fiscal quarter in which the Company has an acquisition of an entity that has portfolio, the entire historical portfolio of the acquired company is aggregated into the pool groups for that quarter, based on common characteristics, resulting in pools for that quarter that may consist of several different vintages of portfolio. Once a static pool is established, the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool. The discount (i.e., the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance) is not recorded because the Company expects to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance. As a result, receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. The purchase cost of the portfolios includes certain fees paid to third parties incurred in connection with the direct acquisition of the receivable portfolios. 
  In compliance with the authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for its investments in receivable portfolios using either the interest method or the cost recovery method. The interest method applies an internal rate of return ( IRR ) to the cost basis of the pool, which remains unchanged throughout the life of the pool, unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s IRR over its remaining life. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the IRR, but are recognized as an allowance to the cost basis of the pool, and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction in revenue, with a corresponding valuation allowance, offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statements of financial condition. With gross collections being discounted at monthly IRRs, when collections are lower in the near term, even if substantially higher collections are expected later in the collection curve, an allowance charge could result. 
  The Company utilizes its proprietary forecasting models to continuously evaluate the economic life of each pool. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company revised the forecasting methodology it uses to value and calculate IRRs on certain portfolios in Europe by extending the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months. This change was made as a result of (1) the Company having observed that older portfolios in Europe have consistently experienced cash collections beyond 120 months, (2) an expectation that regulatory changes in the United Kingdom resulting in a reduction in the number of highly discounted near term one-time settlements, an increase in the number of payment plans, and an increase in the length of existing payment plans will cause a lengthening of the collections curve, (3) an expectation that, as a result of a higher percentage of semi-performing account purchases in the United Kingdom in recent years, newer vintages will have a larger percentage of collections after 120 months and (4) the Company s increased confidence in its ability to forecast future cash collections to 180 months. The increase in the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months was applied effective July 1, 2016 to certain portfolios in Europe for which the Company could accurately forecast through such term. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded allowance charges of approximately   $94.0 million   resulting from delays or shortfalls in near term collections against the forecasts for certain pools in Europe.  These changes in forecasted future cash flows resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios of approximately   $296.5 million   as of September 30, 2016. The increase in the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months had the effect of reducing the allowance charges by approximately   $13.2 million  . For portfolios in Europe that  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

were not extended to 180 months, the Company will continue to include collection forecasts to 120 months in calculating accretion revenue and in its estimated remaining collection disclosures. In the United States, the Company will continue to include collection forecasts to 120 months in calculating accretion revenue. Expected collections beyond the 120 month collection forecast in the United States are included in its estimated remaining collection disclosures but are not included in the calculation of accretion revenue.  
  The Company accounts for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool (similar to one loan) for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios, for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios, and for provision for loss or allowance. Revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s IRR applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis. The cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and portfolio allowance reversals and decreased by gross collections and portfolio allowances.  
  If the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable, the Company accounts for such portfolios on the cost recovery method as Cost Recovery Portfolios. The accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter, or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and, accordingly, they were not aggregated with other portfolios. Under the cost recovery method of accounting, no revenue is recognized until the purchase price of a Cost Recovery Portfolio has been fully recovered. 
  Accretable yield represents the amount of revenue the Company expects to generate over the remaining life of its existing investment in receivable portfolios based on estimated future cash flows. Total accretable yield is the difference between future estimated collections and the current carrying value of a portfolio. All estimated cash flows on portfolios where the cost basis has been fully recovered are classified as zero basis cash flows. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s accretable yield and an estimate of zero basis future cash flows at the beginning and end of the period presented   (in thousands)  :

Purchases of charged-off credit card portfolios during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , include   $216.0 million   of portfolios acquired in connection with the dlc Acquisition. The estimated future collections at acquisition for all portfolios purchased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   amounted to   $1.3 billion  . 
  All collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered ( Zero Basis Portfolios ) are recorded as revenue ( Zero Basis Revenue ). During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Zero Basis Revenue was approximately   $40.0 million   and   $31.8 million  , respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Zero Basis Revenue was approximately   $105.3 million   and   $74.3 million  , respectively.

Note   8  : Deferred Court Costs, Net 
  The Company pursues legal collections using a network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters and through its internal legal channel. The Company generally pursues collections through legal means only when it believes a consumer has sufficient assets to repay their indebtedness but has, to date, been unwilling to pay. In order to pursue legal collections the Company is required to pay certain upfront costs to the applicable courts that are recoverable from the consumer ( Deferred Court Costs ).

     Table of Contents  

The Company capitalizes Deferred Court Costs in its consolidated financial statements and provides a reserve for those costs that it believes will ultimately be uncollectible. The Company determines the reserve based on an estimated court cost recovery rate established based on its analysis of historical court costs recovery data. Based on recent trends of historical court costs recovery data, the Company noted a decrease in the estimated court cost recovery rate in the United Kingdom. Based on the revised estimated court cost recovery rate, the Company recorded an additional court costs reserve of approximately   $11.3 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company estimates deferral periods for Deferred Court Costs based on jurisdiction and nature of litigation. The Company writes off any Deferred Court Costs not recovered within the respective deferral period. Collections received from debtors are first applied against related court costs with the balance applied to the debtors  account balance.

  Encore Senior Secured Notes 
  In 2010 and 2011 Encore entered into an aggregate of   $75.0 million   in senior secured notes with certain affiliates of Prudential Capital Group (the  Senior Secured Notes ).   $25.0 million   of the Senior Secured Notes bear an annual interest rate of   7.375%  , mature in   2018   and require quarterly principal payments of   $1.25 million  . Prior to May 2013, these notes required quarterly payments of interest only. The remaining   $50.0 million   of Senior Secured Notes bear an annual interest rate of   7.75%  , mature in   2017   and require quarterly principal payments of   $2.5 million  . Prior to December 2012 these notes required quarterly interest only payments. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $6.2 million   of the   7.375%   Senior Secured Notes and   $8.2 million   of the   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes, for an aggregate of   $14.4 million  , remained outstanding. 
  The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed in full by certain of Encore s subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Notes are   pari passu   with, and are collateralized by the same collateral as, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated and become automatically and immediately due and payable upon certain events of default, including certain events related to insolvency, bankruptcy, or liquidation. Additionally, the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated at the election of the holder or holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes upon certain events of default by

     Table of Contents  

Encore, including the breach of affirmative covenants regarding guarantors, collateral, most favored lender treatment, minimum revolving credit facility commitment or the breach of any negative covenant. If Encore prepays the Senior Secured Notes at any time for any reason, payment will be at the higher of par or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the portion being prepaid. The discount rate used to determine the present value is   50 basis points   over the then current Treasury Rate corresponding to the remaining average life of the Senior Secured Notes. The covenants are substantially similar to those in the Restated Credit Agreement. Prudential Capital Group and the administrative agent for the lenders of the Restated Credit Agreement have an intercreditor agreement related to their pro rata rights to the collateral, actionable default, powers and duties and remedies, among other topics. The terms of the purchase agreement for the Senior Secured Notes have been amended in connection with amendments to the Restated Credit Agreement in order to align certain provisions between the   two   agreements.

  Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding their respective conversion date (listed below), holders may convert their Convertible Notes under certain circumstances set forth in the applicable Convertible Notes indentures. On or after their respective conversion dates until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding their respective maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time. Certain key terms related to the convertible features for each of the Convertible Notes as of   September 30, 2016   are listed below. 

_______________________ 
           (1) 
    The 2017 Convertible Notes became convertible on January 2, 2014, as certain early conversion events were satisfied. Refer to  Conversion and Earnings Per Share Impact  section below for further details. 
     In the event of conversion, the 2017 Convertible Notes are convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes. The excess conversion premium may be settled in cash or shares of the Company s common stock at the discretion of the Company. In the event of conversion, holders of the Company s 2020 and 2021 Convertible Notes will receive cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s election. The Company s current intent is to settle conversions through combination settlement (  i.e.,   convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount, and shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s election, for the remainder). As a result, and in accordance with authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging and earnings per share, only the conversion spread is included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, if dilutive. Under such method, the settlement of the conversion spread has a dilutive effect when, during any quarter, the average share price of the Company s common stock exceeds the initial conversion prices listed in the above table. 
  Authoritative guidance related to debt with conversion and other options requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that, upon conversion, may be settled fully or partially in cash, must separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Additionally, debt issuance costs are required to be allocated in proportion to the allocation of the liability and equity components and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.

Convertible Notes Hedge Transactions 
  In order to reduce the risk related to the potential dilution and/or the potential cash payments the Company may be required to make in the event that the market price of the Company s common stock becomes greater than the conversion prices of the Convertible Notes, the Company maintains a hedge program that increases the effective conversion price for each of the Convertible Notes. All of the hedge instruments related to the Convertible Notes have been determined to be indexed to the Company s own stock and meet the criteria for equity classification. In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company recorded the cost of the hedge instruments as a reduction in additional paid-in capital, and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of these financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements. 
  The details of the hedge program for each of the Convertible Notes are listed below   (in thousands, except conversion price)  : 

Conversion and Earnings Per Share Impact 
  During the quarter ending December 31, 2013, the closing price of the Company s common stock exceeded   130%   of the conversion price of the 2017 Convertible Notes for more than   20   trading days during a   30   consecutive trading day period, thereby satisfying one of the early conversion events. As a result, the 2017 Convertible Notes became convertible on demand effective January 2, 2014, and the holders were notified that they could elect to submit their 2017 Convertible Notes for

conversion. The carrying value of the 2017 Convertible Notes continues to be reported as debt as the Company intends to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility or use cash on hand to settle the principal amount of any such conversions in cash. No gain or loss was recognized when the debt became convertible. The estimated fair value of the 2017 Convertible Notes was approximately   $115.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, upon becoming convertible, a portion of the equity component that was recorded at the time of the issuance of the 2017 Convertible Notes was considered redeemable and that portion of the equity was reclassified to temporary equity in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Such amount was determined based on the cash consideration to be paid upon conversion and the carrying amount of the debt. Upon conversion, the holders of the 2017 Convertible Notes will be paid in cash for the principal amount. The excess conversion premium may be settled in cash or shares of the Company s common stock at the discretion of the Company. As a result, the Company reclassified   $3.8 million   of the equity component to temporary equity as of   September 30, 2016  . If a conversion event takes place, this temporary equity balance will be recalculated based on the difference between the 2017 Convertible Notes principal and the debt carrying value. If the 2017 Convertible Notes are settled, an amount equal to the fair value of the liability component, immediately prior to the settlement, will be deducted from the fair value of the total settlement consideration transferred and allocated to the liability component. Any difference between the amount allocated to the liability and the net carrying amount of the 2017 Convertible Notes (including any unamortized debt issue costs and discount) will be recognized in earnings as a gain or loss on debt extinguishment. Any remaining consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and will be recognized as a reduction in stockholders  equity. 
  None   of the 2017 Convertible Notes have been converted since they became convertible.

Since such date there have been a number of amendments made, including, but not limited to, increases in the lenders  total commitments thereunder. On October 6, 2016, Cabot Financial UK amended and restated its existing senior secured revolving credit facility agreement to, among other things, increase the total committed amount of the facility to    250.0 million   (approximately   $316.2 million  ), extend the termination date to September 24, 2019 and decrease the interest rate from LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan drawn in euro) plus   3.5%   to LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan drawn in euro) plus   3.25%   (as amended and restated, the  Cabot Credit Facility ). The Cabot Credit Facility also includes an uncommitted accordion provision which will allow the facility to be increased by an additional    50.0 million  , subject to obtaining the requisite commitments and compliance with the terms of Cabot Financial UK s other indebtedness, among other conditions precedent.

The Cabot Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the following indirect subsidiaries of the Company: CCM, Cabot Financial Limited, and all material subsidiaries of Cabot Financial Limited. The Cabot Credit Facility is secured by first ranking security interests in all the outstanding shares of Cabot Financial UK and the guarantors (other than CCM) and substantially all the assets of Cabot Financial UK and the guarantors (other than CCM).

The weighted average interest rate was   3.89%   and   3.88%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   3.97%   and   3.86%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Preferred Equity Certificates 
  On July 1, 2013, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Encore Europe Holdings, S.a.r.l. ( Encore Europe ), completed the acquisition of Cabot (the  Cabot Acquisition ) by acquiring   50.1%   of the equity interest in Janus Holdings S.a.r.l. ( Janus Holdings ). Encore Europe purchased from J.C. Flowers: (i) E Bridge preferred equity certificates issued by Janus Holdings, with a face value of    10,218,574   (approximately   $15.5 million  ) (and any accrued interest thereof) (the  E Bridge PECs ), (ii) E preferred equity certificates issued by Janus Holdings with a face value of    96,729,661   (approximately   $147.1 million  ) (and any accrued interest thereof) (the  E PECs ), (iii)   3,498,563   E shares of Janus Holdings (the  E Shares ), and (iv)   100   A shares of Cabot Holdings S.a.r.l. ( Cabot Holdings ), the direct subsidiary of Janus Holdings, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately    115.1 million   (approximately   $175.0 million  ). The E Bridge PECs, E PECs, and E Shares represent   50.1%   of all of the issued and outstanding equity and debt securities of Janus Holdings. The remaining   49.9%   of Janus Holdings  equity and debt securities are owned by J.C. Flowers and include: (a) J Bridge PECs with a face value of    10,177,781   (approximately   $15.5 million  ), (b) J preferred equity certificates with a face value of    96,343,515   (approximately   $146.5 million  ) (the  J PECs ), (c)   3,484,597   J shares of Janus Holdings (the  J Shares ), and (d)   100   A shares of Cabot Holdings.  
  All of the PECs accrue interest at   12%   per annum. Since PECs are legal form debt, the J Bridge PECs, J PECs and any accrued interests thereof are classified as liabilities and are included in debt in the Company s accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, certain other minority owners hold PECs at the Cabot Holdings level (the  Management PECs ). These PECs are also included in debt in the Company s accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The E Bridge PECs and E PECs held by the Company, and their related interest eliminate in consolidation and therefore are not included in debt in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The J Bridge PECs, J PECs, and the Management PECs do not require the payment of cash interest expense as they have characteristics similar to equity with a preferred return. The ultimate payment of the accumulated interest would be satisfied only in connection with the disposition of the noncontrolling interests of J.C. Flowers and management. 
  On June 20, 2014, Encore Europe converted all of its E Bridge PECs into E Shares and E PECs, and J.C. Flowers converted all of its J Bridge PECs into J Shares and J PECs in proportion to the number of E Shares and E PECs, or J Shares and J PECs, as applicable, outstanding on the closing date of the Cabot Acquisition. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of the PECs, including accrued interest, was approximately   $211.6 million  . 
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  The Company has capital lease obligations primarily for computer equipment. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s combined obligations for capital leases were approximately   $5.9 million  . These capital lease obligations require monthly, quarterly or annual payments through 2020 and have implicit interest rates that range from   zero   to approximately   5.9%  . 
   
  Note   11  : Variable Interest Entity 
  A VIE is defined as a legal entity whose equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk, or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any of the following three characteristics: decision-making rights, the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The primary beneficiary is identified as the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

     Table of Contents  

Prior to March 31, 2016, the Company s VIEs included its subsidiary Janus Holdings and its special purpose entity used for the Propel securitization. On March 31, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of   100%   of its membership interests in Propel. Since Propel is the primary beneficiary of the VIE used for securitization, subsequent to the sale of Propel, the Company no longer consolidates this VIE. 
  Janus Holdings is the indirect parent company of Cabot. The Company has determined that Janus Holdings is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The key activities that affect Cabot s economic performance include, but are not limited to, operational budgets and purchasing decisions. Through its control of the board of directors of Janus Holdings, the Company controls the key operating activities at Cabot.  
  Assets recognized as a result of consolidating the VIE do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company s general assets. Conversely, liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating the VIE do not represent additional claims on the Company s general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of the VIE. 
  The Company evaluates its relationships with its VIE on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to be the primary beneficiary. 
   
  Note   12  : Income Taxes 
  Income tax benefits for loss from continuing operations were   $13.8 million   and   $6.4 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Income tax provisions for income from continuing operations were   $9.8 million   and   $23.2 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The effective tax rates for the respective periods are shown below: 
   
 ________________________ 
           (1) 
    Relates primarily to lower tax rates on income or loss attributable to international operations. 
              (2) 
    Represents a provision for nondeductible items. 
              (3) 
    Includes the effect of discrete items and an IRS audit settlement. 
     The effective tax rates fluctuated significantly during the periods presented due to the following factors. 
  In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, each interim period is considered an integral part of the annual period and tax expense or benefit is measured using an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The estimated annual effective income tax rate for the full year is applied to the respective interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected amounts for the year. Since the Company operates in foreign countries with varying tax rates that are much lower than the tax rate in the United States, the magnitude of the impact of the results from the international operations have on the Company s quarterly effective tax rate is dependent on the level of income or loss from the international operations in the period. During the third quarter, the Company recorded a large allowance charge on certain portfolio pool groups in Europe and incurred pre-tax losses. As required under the authoritative guidance for interim tax reporting, the Company considered this loss and the related tax benefit in determining its estimated tax rate for the year, which is then applied to the third quarter pre-tax results in determining the quarterly tax expense. Since the loss is tax effected at a much lower tax rate in the United Kingdom, which results in lower tax benefit; and the income in the United States is taxed at a much higher tax rate, which results in higher tax expense, the loss has the effect of increasing the Company s estimated annual tax rate significantly.  
  The Company s subsidiary in Costa Rica is operating under a   100%   tax holiday through December 31, 2018 and a   50%   tax holiday for the subsequent   four   years. The impact of the tax holiday in Costa Rica for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, was immaterial.

The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of penalties and interest, of   $23.9 million   and   $58.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. These unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would result in a net tax benefit of   $10.3 million   and   $14.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The reduction in gross unrecognized tax benefits was due to certain state statute of limitation closing. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company did not provide for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the quarterly undistributed earnings from operations of its subsidiaries operating outside of the United States. Undistributed pre-tax income of these subsidiaries was approximately   zero   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Note   13  : Commitments and Contingencies 
  Litigation and Regulatory 
  The Company is involved in disputes, legal actions, regulatory investigations, inquiries, and other actions from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company, along with others in its industry, is routinely subject to legal actions based on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), comparable state statutes, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ), state and federal unfair competition statutes, and common law causes of action. The violations of law investigated or alleged in these actions often include claims that the Company lacks specified licenses to conduct its business, attempts to collect debts on which the statute of limitations has run, has made inaccurate or unsupported assertions of fact in support of its collection actions and/or has acted improperly in connection with its efforts to contact consumers. Such litigation and regulatory actions could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions, injunctive relief, or changes in business practices. Many continue on for some length of time and involve substantial investigation, litigation, negotiation, and other expense and effort before a result is achieved, and during the process the Company often cannot determine the substance or timing of any eventual outcome. 
  Except as described in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, at   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material developments in any of the legal proceedings disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  In certain legal proceedings, the Company may have recourse to insurance or third party contractual indemnities to cover all or portions of its litigation expenses, judgments, or settlements. In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company records loss contingencies in its financial statements only for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability. The Company continuously assesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and regulatory matters and revises its estimates when additional information becomes available. In September 2016, the Company recorded   $2.4 million   to the TCPA settlement fund in addition to the existing reserve. As of   September 30, 2016  , other than this additional TCPA reserve, the reserves for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and ancillary state regulatory matters discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has   no   material reserves for legal matters. Additionally, based on the current status of litigation and regulatory matters, either the estimate of exposure is immaterial to the Company s financial statements or an estimate cannot yet be determined. The Company s legal costs are recorded to expense as incurred. 
  Purchase Commitments 
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into forward flow purchase agreements and other purchase commitment agreements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has entered into agreements to purchase receivable portfolios with a face value of approximately   $2.2 billion   for a purchase price of approximately   $346.3 million  . Most purchase commitments do not extend past one year.

Note   14  : Segment Information 
  The Company conducts business through several operating segments that meet the aggregation criteria under authoritative guidance related to segment reporting. The Company s management relies on internal management reporting processes that provide segment revenue, segment operating income, and segment asset information in order to make financial decisions and allocate resources. Prior to the first quarter 2016 the Company had determined that it had   two   reportable segments: portfolio purchasing and recovery and tax lien business. As discussed in Note   2  ,  Discontinued Operations,  on March 31, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its membership interests in Propel, which comprised the entire tax lien business segment. Propel s operations are presented as discontinued operations in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Beginning in the first quarter 2016, the Company has   one   reportable segment, portfolio purchasing and recovery. 
  The following table presents information about geographic areas in which the Company operates   (in thousands)  :

    Based on the financial information that is used to produce the general-purpose financial statements, providing further geographic information is impracticable. 
              (3) 
    Revenues from Europe during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are net of the allowance charge of   $94.0 million   as discussed in Note 7,  Investment in Receivable Portfolios, Net .   
      
  Note   15  : Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
  In accordance with authoritative guidance, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and in interim periods if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires the Company to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. 
  In connection with the divestiture of Propel as discussed in Note   2  ,  Discontinued Operations,  the Company wrote-down the entire goodwill balance of   $49.3 million   carried at Propel that represented the entire tax lien business reporting unit as of December 31, 2015. 
  The annual goodwill testing date for the reporting units that are included in the portfolio purchasing and recovery reportable segment is October 1st. There have been no events or circumstances during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that have required the Company to perform an interim assessment of goodwill carried at these reporting units. Management continues to evaluate and monitor all key factors impacting the carrying value of the Company s recorded goodwill and long-lived assets. Adverse changes in the Company s actual or expected operating results, market capitalization, business climate, economic factors or other negative events that may be outside the control of management could result in a material non-cash impairment charge in the future.

  Our Business and Operating Segments 
  We are an international specialty finance company providing debt recovery solutions for consumers across a broad range of financial assets. We purchase portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and manage them by working with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery. Defaulted receivables are consumers  unpaid financial commitments to credit originators, including banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, commercial retailers, and telecommunication companies. Defaulted receivables may also include receivables subject to bankruptcy proceedings. Through certain subsidiaries, we are a market leader in portfolio purchasing and recovery in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Our subsidiary, Janus Holdings Luxembourg S.a.r.l. ( Janus Holdings ), through its indirectly held U.K.-based subsidiary Cabot Credit Management Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Cabot ), is a market leader in credit management services in the United Kingdom, historically specializing in portfolios consisting of higher balance, semi-performing accounts (  i.e.  , debt portfolios in which over 50% of the accounts have received a payment in three of the last four months immediately prior to the portfolio purchase). Cabot expanded in the United Kingdom with its consolidating acquisition of Hillesden Securities Ltd and its subsidiaries ( dlc ) in June 2015. Our majority-owned subsidiary, Grove Holdings ( Grove ), is a U.K.-based leading specialty investment firm focused on consumer non-performing loans, including insolvencies (in particular, individual voluntary arrangements, or  IVAs ) in the United Kingdom and bank and non-bank receivables in Spain. Our majority-owned subsidiary, Refinancia S.A. ( Refinancia ), through its subsidiaries, is a market leader in debt collection and management in Colombia and Peru. In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in Baycorp Holdings Pty Limited ( Baycorp ), one of Australasia's leading debt resolution specialists.  
  On March 31, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our membership interests in Propel Acquisition LLC ( Propel ). Propel represented our entire tax lien business reportable segment prior to the divestiture. Propel s operations are presented as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Beginning in the first quarter 2016, we conduct business through one reportable segment, portfolio purchasing and recovery. 
  Our long-term growth strategy involves continuing to invest in our core portfolio purchasing and recovery business, expanding into new geographies, and leveraging our core competencies to explore expansion into adjacent asset classes.  
  Government Regulation 
  United States 
  As discussed in more detail under  Part I - Item1 - Business - Government Regulation  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our U.S. debt purchasing business and collection activities are subject to federal, state and municipal statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances that establish specific guidelines and procedures that debt purchasers and collectors must follow  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

when collecting consumer accounts, including among others, specific guidelines and procedures for communicating with consumers and prohibitions on unfair, deceptive or abusive debt collection practices. 
  For example, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) may adopt new regulations that may affect our industry and our business. In July 2016, the CFPB released an outline of proposals under consideration for its debt collection rulemaking. The proposals are aimed at ensuring debt collectors, among other things: collect the correct debt; limit excessive or disruptive communications; stop collecting or suing for debt without proper documentation; and provide documentation substantiating debt to a consumer upon demand. The outline of proposals was released by the CFPB in preparation for convening a Small Business Review Panel to gather feedback from small industry players, which is the next step in the rulemaking process. In addition to consulting with small business representatives, the CFPB will continue to seek input from the public, consumer groups, industry, and other stakeholders before continuing the rulemaking process. We believe the rulemaking will provide important clarity around key issues for our industry, help raise industry standards, and create a more level playing field for all companies, large and small. Many of the proposals for consideration released by the CFPB are already part of our current operations, however it is not yet possible to predict the precise impact any final rulemaking will have on our operations and operating results.  
  Additionally, the CFPB has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over our business and is currently examining the collection practices of participants in the consumer debt buying industry. The CFPB has recently engaged in enforcement activity in sectors adjacent to our industry, impacting credit originators, collection firms, and payment processors, among others. The CFPB s enforcement activity in these sectors, especially in the absence of clear rules or regulatory expectations, can be disruptive as industry participants attempt to define appropriate business practices. As a result of the current regulatory environment, certain current practices or commercial relationships we maintain may be disrupted or impacted by changes in our or third-parties  business practices or perceptions of elevated risk.  
  International 
  As discussed in more detail under  Part I - Item1 - Business - Government Regulation  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our international operations are affected by foreign statutes, rules and regulations regarding debt collection and debt purchase activities. These statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, guidelines and procedures are modified from time to time by the relevant authorities charged with their administration, which could affect the way we conduct our business. 
  In the United Kingdom, Cabot applied for full authorization of its business with the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) in March 2015 and Cabot Credit Management Group Limited ( CCMG ), a Cabot subsidiary, became authorized and regulated by the FCA in March 2016. CCMG appointed other Cabot subsidiaries as its representatives to carry out debt-collecting and debt administration services on its behalf. CCMG assumes full regulatory responsibility for such entities. In addition to the full authorization of its business with the FCA, CCMG has appointed certain individuals who have significant control or influence over the management of the business, known as  Approved Persons,  and who will jointly and severally be liable for the acts and omissions of CCMG and its business affairs. Approved Persons will be subject to statements of principle and codes of practice established and enforced by the FCA. 
  The FCA has adopted detailed rules relating to conducting consumer credit activities, in addition to putting in place high-level principles and conditions to which it expects businesses and Approved Persons in the sector to adhere. The FCA has the ability to impose significant fines, ban certain individuals from carrying on trade within the financial services industry, cease certain products from being collected upon and in extreme circumstance remove permissions to trade. 
  As part of its philosophy of continuous improvement, CCMG regularly reviews policy and practice across all of its business units, to ensure that we can evidence an appropriate and consistent level of compliance to the regulatory requirements. The changes made to policy and practice over the last few years have been designed to reflect the FCA s outcome based approach, which focuses on the actual customer impact and the key behavioral drivers. Examples of changes made include a call framework refresh that enables increased flexibility for call handlers to tailor conversations to reflect the specific customer circumstances and increased focus on the identification of customer vulnerability. 
  The FCA also requires that debt repayments agreed with consumers are evidenced as affordable to the consumer, this results in a means-based evaluation of proposed repayments, be that one time settlements or installments over time. We believe this, combined with the changes as described above, have gradually resulted in: a reduction in the number of highly discounted near term one-time settlements; an increase in the number of payment plans, including a shift from legal collections to repayment plans; and an increase in the length of existing payment plans. As a result, we have seen a reduction in the amount of collections in the near term and expect a lengthening of our collections curve. CCMG continues to implement and evaluate operational strategies that are designed to increase collections and mitigate the effects of shifting of collections from the near term to later in our collections curve.

New legislation, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) will replace the current Data Protection Act in 2018. This will introduce significant changes to the data protection regime including but not limited to: the conditions for obtaining consent to process personal data; transparency and providing information to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data; enhanced rights for individuals; notification obligations for personal data breach; and supervisory authorities including a European Data Protection Board ( EDPB ). We have analyzed the GDPR requirements and are working to ensure that we become compliant. 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union (the  E.U. ), commonly referred to as  Brexit . The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the U.K. government formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.U., including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. Additionally, a withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the E.U. will have and how such withdrawal will affect us. The GDPR requirements discussed above will not be impacted by the United Kingdom leaving the E.U. 
  As a result of the Brexit referendum foreign currency exchange rates have been impacted. In particular, the value of the British Pound has declined as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the United Kingdom negotiates and executes its exit from the E.U. but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur. A significantly weaker British Pound compared to the U.S. dollar could have a significant negative effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Portfolio Purchasing and Recovery 
  United States 
  We purchase receivables based on robust, account-level valuation methods and employ proprietary statistical and behavioral models across our U.S. operations. These methods and models allow us to value portfolios accurately (and limit the risk of overpaying), avoid buying portfolios that are incompatible with our methods or goals and align the accounts we purchase with our business channels to maximize future collections. As a result, we have been able to realize significant returns from the receivables we acquire. We maintain strong relationships with many of the largest financial service providers in the United States. 
  While seasonality does not have a material impact on our portfolio purchasing and recovery business, collections are generally strongest in our first calendar quarter, slower in the second and third calendar quarters, and slowest in the fourth calendar quarter. Relatively higher collections in the first quarter could result in a lower cost-to-collect ratio compared to the other quarters, as our fixed costs are relatively constant and applied against a larger collection base. The seasonal impact on our business may also be influenced by our purchasing levels, the types of portfolios we purchase, and our operating strategies. 
  Collection seasonality can also affect revenue as a percentage of collections, also referred to as our revenue recognition rate. Generally, revenue for each pool group declines steadily over time, whereas collections can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on seasonality, as described above. In quarters with lower collections (  e.g.,   the fourth calendar quarter), the revenue recognition rate can be higher than in quarters with higher collections (  e.g.,   the first calendar quarter). 
  In addition, seasonality could have an impact on the relative level of quarterly earnings. In quarters with stronger collections, total costs are higher as a result of the additional efforts required to generate those collections. Since revenue for each pool group declines steadily over time, in quarters with higher collections and higher costs (  e.g.,   the first calendar quarter), all else being equal, earnings could be lower than in quarters with lower collections and lower costs (  e.g.,   the fourth calendar quarter). Additionally, in quarters where a greater percentage of collections come from our legal and agency outsourcing channels, cost to collect will be higher than if there were more collections from our internal collection sites. 
  Europe 
  Cabot:     Through Cabot, we purchase paying and non-paying receivable portfolios using a proprietary pricing model that utilizes account-level statistical and behavioral data. This model allows Cabot to value portfolios with a high degree of accuracy and quantify portfolio performance in order to maximize future collections. As a result, Cabot has been able to realize significant returns from the assets it has acquired. Cabot maintains strong relationships with many of the largest financial

     Table of Contents  

services providers in the United Kingdom and continues to expand in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe with its acquisitions of portfolios and other credit management services providers. 
  While seasonality does not have a material impact on Cabot s operations, collections are generally strongest in the second and third calendar quarters and slower in the first and fourth quarters, largely driven by the impact of the December holiday season and the New Year holiday, and the related impact on its customers  ability to repay their balances. This drives a higher level of plan defaults over this period, which are typically repaired across the first quarter of the following year. The August vacation season in the United Kingdom also has an unfavorable effect on the level of collections, but this is traditionally compensated for by higher collections in July and September. 
  Grove:   On April 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a controlling equity ownership interest in Grove. Grove, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading specialty investment firm focused on consumer non-performing loans, including insolvencies (in particular, IVAs) in the United Kingdom and bank and non-bank receivables in Spain. Grove purchases portfolio receivables using a proprietary pricing model. This model allows Grove to value portfolios and quantify portfolio performance in order to maximize future collections. 
  Latin America 
  In December 2013, we acquired a majority ownership interest in Refinancia, a market leader in debt collection and management in Colombia and Peru. In addition to purchasing defaulted receivables, Refinancia offers portfolio management services to banks for non-performing loans. Refinancia also specializes in non-traditional niches in the geographic areas in which it operates, including providing financial solutions to individuals who have previously defaulted on their credit obligations. In addition to operations in Colombia and Peru, we evaluate and purchase non-performing loans in other countries in Latin America, including Mexico and Brazil. We also invest in non-performing secured residential mortgages in Latin America. 
  Asia Pacific 
  Through our acquisition of a majority ownership interest in Baycorp in October 2015 (the  Baycorp Acquisition ), we are one of Australia s leading debt resolution specialists. Baycorp specializes in the management of non-performing loans in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to purchasing defaulted receivables, Baycorp offers portfolio management services to banks for non-performing loans. 
   
  Purchases and Collections 
  Portfolio Pricing, Supply and Demand 
  United States 
  Prices for portfolios offered for sale directly from credit issuers are beginning to decrease after several years of elevated pricing, especially for fresh portfolios. Fresh portfolios are portfolios that are generally transacted within six months of the consumer s account being charged-off by the financial institution. Industry delinquency and charge off rates have been at historic lows, and they are beginning to increase which creates higher volumes of charged-off accounts. We believe the softening in pricing, especially fresh, is primarily due to this anticipated growth in supply.  
  We believe that smaller competitors continue to face difficulties in the portfolio purchasing market because of the high cost to operate due to regulatory pressure and because issuers are being more selective with buyers in the marketplace, resulting in consolidation within the portfolio purchasing and recovery industry. We believe this favors larger participants in this market, such as Encore, because the larger market participants are better able to adapt to these pressures. Furthermore, as smaller competitors limit their participation in or exit the market, it may provide additional opportunities for Encore to purchase portfolios from competitors or to acquire competitors directly. 
  Europe 
  The U.K. market for charged-off portfolios has grown significantly in recent years driven by a consolidation of sellers and a material backlog of portfolio coming to market from credit issuers who are selling an increasing proportion of their non-performing loans. Prices for portfolios offered for sale directly from credit issuers remain at levels higher than historical averages. We expect that as a result of an increase in available funding to industry participants, and lower return requirements for certain debt purchasers, pricing will remain elevated. 
  The U.K. insolvency market saw historically low sales volumes from banks in the last twelve months. We expect there will be increased purchasing opportunities once large retail banks start to sell their insolvency portfolios. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

The Spanish consumer and small and medium enterprise non-performing loan market remains significant, with most of the major banks selling portfolios. While competition remains strong in large banking trades, recently there have been multiple complex sales from consolidated regional banks trading at more favorable returns as portfolio sale sizes and an increased asset mix of SME (small and medium enterprise) and other corporate debtors reduce competition. 
  Although pricing has been elevated, we believe that as our U.K. businesses increase in scale and expand to other European markets, and with anticipated improvements in liquidation and improved efficiencies in collections, our margins will remain competitive. Additionally, Cabot s continuing investment in its liquidation channel through litigation has enabled them to collect from consumers who have the ability to pay, but have so far been unwilling to do so. 
  Purchases by Type and Geographic Location 
  The following table summarizes the types and geographic locations of consumer receivable portfolios we purchased during the periods presented   (in thousands):   

  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we invested   $206.4 million   to acquire consumer receivable portfolios, with face values aggregating   $1.5 billion  , for an average purchase price of   14.0%   of face value. This is a   $19.2 million  , or   10.3%  ,   increase   in the amount invested, compared with the   $187.2 million   invested during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , to acquire consumer receivable portfolios with face values aggregating   $2.1 billion  , for an average purchase price of   9.0%   of face value.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we invested   $696.2 million   to acquire consumer receivable portfolios, with face values aggregating   $7.9 billion  , for an average purchase price of   8.9%   of face value. This is a   $34.9 million  , or   4.8%  ,   decrease   in the amount invested, compared with the   $731.1 million   invested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , to acquire consumer receivable portfolios with face values aggregating   $8.7 billion  , for an average purchase price of   8.4%   of face value.  
  The increase in capital deployment for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily the result of increased purchasing volume in the United States due to the improved pricing environment. The decrease in capital deployment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was due to the $216.0 million of receivable portfolios acquired in connection with the dlc Acquisition in June 2015. Excluding the portfolios acquired in connection with the dlc Acquisition, capital deployment increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased purchasing volume in the United States and Cabot s investment in Spain, France and Portugal as part of its European expansion strategy. 
  The average purchase price, as a percentage of face value, varies from period to period depending on, among other factors, the quality of the accounts purchased and the length of time from charge-off to the time we purchase the portfolios. Additionally, the improved pricing environment has not materialized to blend down the average purchase price as a percentage of face value in the United States.

Collections by Channel and Geographic Location 
  We currently utilize three channels for the collection of our receivables: collection sites, legal collections, and collection agencies. The collection sites channel consists of collections that result from our call centers, direct mail program and online collections. The legal collections channel consists of collections that result from our internal legal channel or from our network of retained law firms.  The collection agencies channel consists of collections from third-party collection agencies that we utilize when we believe they can liquidate better or less expensively than we can or to supplement capacity in our internal call centers. The following table summarizes the total collections by collection channel and geographic area   (in thousands)  :   
 ________________________ 
           (1) 
    Collections through our collection agency channel in the United States include accounts subject to bankruptcy filings collected by others. Additionally, collection agency collections often include accounts purchased from a competitor where we maintain the collection agency servicing until the accounts can be recalled and placed in our collection channels. 
     Gross collections   decrease  d by   $14.8 million  , or   3.5%  , to   $407.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $421.8 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to decreased collections in the United States and Europe, partially offset by increased collections in other geographies. The decrease in collections in the United States was primarily due to a decrease in legal collections resulting from temporary delays in receiving media from issuers required to initiate the legal process for a number of accounts. We believe these temporary delays will decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect increased placements in our legal channel thereafter. In Europe, the decrease in collections was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily driven by the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. dollar. As we continue to expand and enhance our in-house servicing capabilities in Europe, we expect collections to shift from collection agencies to collection sites and legal collections. The increase in legal collections was primarily due to an increase in the accounts placed in the legal channel as we continuously improve our ability to identify consumers that are able, but unwilling, to pay their obligations. In other geographies collections continue to increase as the Company expands internationally. 
  Gross collections   increase  d slightly by   $4.8 million  , or   0.4%  , to   $1,288.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $1,284.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased collections in Europe and other geographies, offset by a decrease of collections in the United States. The increase in collections in Europe was primarily the result of increased legal collections offset by a decrease in collection agency collections. The increase in legal collections was primarily due to an increase in the accounts placed in the legal channel as we continuously improve our ability to identify consumers that are able, but unwilling, to pay their obligations. As we continue to expand and enhance our in-house servicing capabilities in Europe, we expect collections to shift from collection agencies to collection sites and legal collections.

( Encore Europe ), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Encore. 
   
  Comparison of Results of Operations 
   
  Revenues 
  Our revenues consist of portfolio revenue and other revenue. 
  Portfolio revenue consists of accretion revenue and Zero Basis Revenue. Accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools (quarterly groupings of purchased receivable portfolios) with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized. Revenue from pools with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis. The cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and portfolio allowances. The effective interest rate is the IRR derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool. All collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered, or Zero Basis Portfolios ( ZBA ), are recorded as revenue, or Zero Basis Revenue. We account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the authoritative guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality. We may incur allowance charges when actual cash flows from our receivable portfolios underperform compared to our expectations or when there is a change in timing of cash flows. Factors that may contribute to underperformance and to the recording of valuation allowances may include both internal as well as external factors. Internal factors that may have an impact on our collections include operational activities, such as the productivity of our collection staff.  External factors that may have an impact on our collections include new laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, and the overall condition of the economy. We record allowance reversals on pool groups that have historic allowance reserves when actual cash flows from these receivable portfolios outperform our expectations. Allowance reversals are included in portfolio revenue. 
  Other revenues consist primarily of contingent fee income earned on accounts collected on behalf of others, primarily credit originators. 
  Our operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has an unfavorable impact on our international revenues, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has a favorable impact on our international revenues. Our revenues were impacted by  
  
   41 

foreign currency translation, primarily by the weakening of the British Pound, which devalued against the U.S. dollar by 15.2% and 9.1%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the comparable periods in 2015. 
  Portfolio revenue was   $159.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $106.0 million  , or   39.9%  , compared to   $265.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Portfolio revenue was   $697.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $102.8 million  , or   12.9%  , compared to revenue of   $799.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease  s in portfolio revenue during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable periods in   2015   were the result of allowance charges recorded on certain pools in Europe and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. dollar. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded allowance charges of approximately $94.0 million resulting from delays or shortfalls in near term collections against our forecasts for certain pools in Europe. These allowance charges, net of portfolio allowance reversals on other pools, attributed to the net portfolio allowance of   $91.4 million   and   $86.8 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net portfolio allowance of   $3.3 million   and a net portfolio allowance reversal of   $4.0 million  , respectively. The net portfolio allowance reversals recorded in 2015 were primarily due to the reversal of remaining allowance reserves for certain ZBA pool groups with cash collections, offset by an $8.3 million portfolio allowance charge resulting from our settlement with the CFPB. 
  Additionally, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we revised the forecasting methodology we use to value and calculate IRRs on certain portfolios in Europe by extending the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months. This change was made as a result of (1) our observation that older portfolios in Europe have consistently experienced cash collections beyond 120 months, (2) an expectation that regulatory changes in the United Kingdom resulting in a reduction in the number of highly discounted near term one-time settlements, an increase in the number of payment plans, and an increase in the length of existing payment plans will cause a lengthening of our collections curve, (3) an expectation that, as a result of a higher percentage of semi-performing account purchases in the United Kingdom in recent years, newer vintages will have a larger percentage of collections after 120 months and (4) our increased confidence in our ability to forecast future cash collections to 180 months. The increase in the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months was applied effective July 1, 2016, to certain portfolios in Europe for which we could accurately forecast through such term. In addition, as discussed above, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded allowance charges of approximately $94.0 million resulting from delays or shortfalls in collections against the forecasts for certain pools in Europe. These changes in forecasted future cash flows resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios of approximately   $296.5 million   as of September 30, 2016. The increase in the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months had the effect of reducing the allowance charges by approximately   $13.2 million  . For portfolios in Europe that were not extended to 180 months,  we will continue to include collection forecast to 120 months in calculating accretion revenue and in our estimated remaining collection disclosures. In the United States, we will continue to include collection forecast to 120 months in calculating accretion revenue. Expected collections beyond the 120 month collection forecast in the United States are included in our estimated remaining collection disclosures but are not included in the calculation of accretion revenue.

     Other revenues were   $19.9 million   and   $13.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $60.8 million   and   $39.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to contingent fee income earned at our international subsidiaries, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Most of our other revenues are from our international subsidiaries and therefore, other revenues were unfavorably impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies during the periods presented. 
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses were   $200.6 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $47.6 million  , or   19.2%  , compared to total operating expenses of   $248.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30,  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

2015  . Total operating expenses were   $603.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $37.6 million  , or   5.9%  , compared to total operating expenses of   $641.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating expenses are explained in more detail as follows: 
  Salaries and Employee Benefits 
  Salaries and employee benefits increased   $4.8 million  , or   7.6%  , to   $67.8 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $63.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily the result of increases in headcount and related compensation expense of approximately $9.0 million for our international subsidiaries, offset by a decrease of $4.6 million in stock-based compensation expense. 
  Salaries and employee benefits increased   $18.8 million  , or   9.7%  , to   $212.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $194.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily the result of increases in headcount and related compensation expense of approximately $31.4 million for our international subsidiaries, offset by a decrease of $7.8 million in stock-based compensation expense and a net decrease in other salaries and employee benefits in our U.S. operations. 
  Stock-based compensation   decreased     $4.6 million  , or   87.7%  , to   $0.6 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $5.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Stock-based compensation   decreased     $7.8 million  , or   44.9%  , to   $9.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $17.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decreases were primarily attributable to expense reversals resulting from adjustments to estimated vesting of certain performance-based awards and lower fair value of equity awards granted in recent periods. 
  Cost of Legal Collections 
  Cost of legal collections includes primarily contingent fees paid to our network of attorneys and the cost of litigation. We pursue legal collection using a network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters and through our internal legal channel. Under the agreements with our contracted attorneys, we advance certain out-of-pocket court costs, or Deferred Court Costs. We capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible. We determine the reserve based on an estimated court cost recovery rate based on our analysis of historical court costs recovery data. Based on recent trends of historical court costs recovery data, we noted a decrease in the estimated court cost recovery rate in the United Kingdom. Based on the revised estimated court cost recovery rate, we recorded an additional court costs reserve in the cost of legal collections of approximately $11.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , overall cost of legal collections   decrease  d   $1.9 million  , or   3.1%  , to   $56.9 million  , as compared to   $58.8 million   during the corresponding period in the prior year. Cost of legal collections in the United States   decrease  d by   $14.2 million  , or   26.8%  , while cost of legal collections in Europe increased by   $12.5 million  , or   216.9%  , as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel was   34.5%   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , an   increase   from   32.9%   during the corresponding period in 2015. The cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel in the United States was   29.6%   and   34.4%   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel in Europe was   57.9%   and   23.3%   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , overall cost of legal collections   decrease  d   $12.8 million  , or   7.5%  , to   $158.0 million  , as compared to   $170.8 million   during the corresponding period in the prior year. Cost of legal collections in the United States   decrease  d by   $28.9 million  , or   19.0%  , while cost of legal collections in Europe   increase  d by   $14.9 million  , or   81.1%   as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel was   29.8%   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   from   31.4%   during the corresponding period in 2015. The cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel in the United States was   28.9%   and   31.7%   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel in Europe was   35.2%   and   28.9%   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  
  The decreases in the cost of legal collections and the cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel in the United States during the periods presented were due to a reduction in upfront court costs as a result of fewer accounts placed in this channel because of temporary delays in receiving media from issuers required to initiate the legal process for a number of accounts as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. We believe these temporary delays  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

will decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect increased placements in our legal channel thereafter. The increases in cost of legal collections and the cost of legal collections as a percentage of gross collections through this channel in Europe during the periods presented were the result of the $11.3 million additional court costs reserve as discussed above. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  Other operating expenses   increase  d by   $1.9 million  , or   8.6%  , to   $24.1 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $22.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Other operating expenses   increase  d   $7.1 million  , or   10.5%  , to   $75.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $68.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the prior period, was primarily due to increased costs relating to various operation support activities, including skip tracing, media requests and bank charges. 
  Collection Agency Commissions 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $8.8 million   in commissions to third-party collection agencies, or   19.1%   of the related gross collections of   $46.3 million  . During the period, the commission rate as a percentage of related gross collections was   7.2%   and   24.5%   for our collection outsourcing channels in the United States and Europe, respectively. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $9.4 million   in commissions, or   16.7%  , of the related gross collections of   $56.0 million  . During the period, the commission rate as a percentage of related gross collections was   13.3%   and   18.8%   for our collection outsourcing channels in the United States and Europe, respectively. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $28.2 million   in commissions to third-party collection agencies, or   18.2%   of the related gross collections of   $155.0 million  . During the period, the commission rate as a percentage of related gross collections was   9.5%   and   21.6%   for our collection outsourcing channels in the United States and Europe, respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $28.5 million   in commissions, or   17.2%  , of the related gross collections of   $166.0 million  . During the period, the commission rate as a percentage of related gross collections was   15.6%   and   18.0%   for our collection outsourcing channels in the United States and Europe, respectively. 
  Collections through this channel vary from period to period depending on, among other things, the number of accounts placed with an agency versus accounts collected internally. Commissions, as a percentage of collections in this channel also vary from period to period depending on, among other things, the amount of time that has passed since the charge-off of the accounts placed with an agency, the asset class, and the geographic location of the receivables. Generally, freshly charged-off accounts have a lower commission rate than accounts that have been charged off for a longer period of time. Additionally, commission rates are lower in the United Kingdom where most of the receivables in this channel are semi-performing loans and IVAs, while the commission rates are higher in other European countries where most of the receivables in this channel are non-performing loans. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses   decrease  d   $51.9 million  , or   59.8%  , to   $34.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $86.8 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses, and settlement fees and related administrative expenses of   $5.1 million   and   $55.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, general and administrative expenses   decrease  d by   $1.2 million  , or   3.7%  , to   $29.7 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $30.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  General and administrative expenses   decrease  d   $52.6 million  , or   33.8%  , to   $103.0 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $155.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Excluding acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses and settlement fees and related administrative expenses of   $12.3 million   and   $68.0 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, general and administrative expenses   increase  d   $3.1 million  , or   3.5%  , to   $90.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $87.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses at our international subsidiaries. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense was consistent at   $8.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense   increase  d   $2.0 million  , or   8.6%  , to   $26.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $24.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to additional depreciation and amortization expenses resulting from fixed assets and intangible assets acquired through our recent acquisitions.

Cost per Dollar Collected 
  We utilize adjusted operating expenses in order to facilitate a comparison of approximate cash costs to cash collections for our portfolio purchasing and recovery business. The calculation of adjusted operating expenses is illustrated in detail in the  Non-GAAP Disclosure  section. The following table summarizes our overall cost per dollar collected by geographic location during the periods presented:   

  Our overall cost per dollar collected (or  cost-to-collect ) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   41.1%  , up   190   basis points from   39.2%   during the prior period. Overall cost-to-collect remained consistent at   38.5%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase in overall cost-to-collect during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily due to increased cost-to-collect in Europe, offset by improved cost-to-collect in the United States. The steep increase in cost-to-collect in Europe was primarily due to the recording of approximately $11.3 million additional court costs reserve in the United Kingdom during the three months ended September 30, 2016. To counter higher prices in the U.S. market, we implemented innovative consumer-centric programs aimed at increasing liquidations. These programs were initiated in the beginning of 2014 and have become increasingly successful. As we continue to grow our presence in the Latin American market, we expect to incur upfront cost in building our collection channels. As a result, cost-to-collect in this region may become elevated in the near term and may fluctuate over time. 
  Over time, we expect our cost-to-collect to remain competitive, but also to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on seasonality, acquisitions, the cost of investments in new operating initiatives, and the changing regulatory and legislative environment.  
   
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense   increase  d   $0.8 million   to   $48.6 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $47.8 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Interest expense   increase  d   $13.5 million   to   $149.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $136.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  The following tables summarize our interest expense (  in thousands):

The payment of the accumulated interest on the preferred equity certificates issued in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Cabot will only be satisfied in connection with the disposition of the noncontrolling interests of J.C. Flowers   Co. LLC and management. 
  The increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to interest expense recognized at Baycorp, which was acquired in October 2015. The increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased average debt levels in the United States and Europe and interest expense recognized at Baycorp. 
   
  Other Income (Expense) 
  Other income or expense consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains or losses and interest income. Other income was   $4.1 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , up from other expense of   $0.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Other income was   $14.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , up from   $1.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increases during the periods presented were primarily due to net gains recognized on foreign exchange contracts. 
  In 2016, Encore and its Cabot subsidiary collectively began entering into currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the British Pound and Euro. These derivative contracts generally mature within one to three months and are not designated as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. The gains or losses on these derivative contracts are recognized in other income or expense based on the changes in fair value. Before the effect of income tax and noncontrolling interest, the net gain on these derivative contracts recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations was   $3.3 million   and   $10.7 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
   
  Income Taxes 
  We recorded income tax benefits for loss from continuing operations of   $13.8 million   and   $6.4 million  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We recorded income tax provisions for income from continuing operations of   $9.8 million   and   $23.2 million  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The effective tax rates for the respective periods are shown below: 
   
 ________________________ 
           (1) 
    Relates primarily to lower tax rates on income or loss attributable to international operations. 
              (2) 
    Represents a provision for nondeductible items. 
              (3) 
    Includes the effect of discrete items and an IRS audit settlement. 
     Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory tax rates. 
  The effective tax rates fluctuated significantly during the periods presented due to the following factors. 
  In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, each interim period is considered an integral part of the annual period and tax expense or benefit is measured using an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The estimated annual  
  
   50 

     Table of Contents  

effective income tax rate for the full year is applied to the respective interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected amounts for the year. Since we operate in foreign countries with varying tax rates that are much lower than the tax rate in the United States, the magnitude of the impact of the results from the international operations have on our quarterly effective tax rate is dependent on the level of income or loss from the international operations in the period. During the third quarter, we recorded a large allowance charge on certain portfolio pool groups in Europe and incurred pre-tax losses. As required under the authoritative guidance for interim tax reporting, we considered this loss and the related tax benefit in determining our estimated tax rate for the year, which is then applied to our third quarter pre-tax results in determining our tax expense. Since the loss is tax effected at a much lower tax rate in the United Kingdom, which results in lower tax benefit; and the income in the United States is taxed at a much higher tax rate, which results in higher tax expense, the loss has the effect of increasing our estimated annual tax rate significantly. Additionally, since the tax rate expected for the year will also be much higher due to the aforementioned factors, we expect that our tax expense in the fourth quarter will likely exceed tax expense that would normally be expected by approximately $10 million. 
  Our subsidiary in Costa Rica is operating under a 100% tax holiday through December 31, 2018 and a 50% tax holiday for the subsequent four years. The impact of the tax holiday in Costa Rica for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was immaterial. 
   
  Non-GAAP Disclosure 
  In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), we provide historical non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. 
  Management believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments, and amortization methods, which provide a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. 
  Adjusted Income From Continuing Operations Per Share.   Management uses non-GAAP adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore and adjusted income from continuing operations per share (which we also refer to from time to time as adjusted earnings per share), to assess operating performance, in order to highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore excludes non-cash interest and issuance cost amortization relating to our convertible notes, one-time charges, acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses, settlement fees and related administrative expenses, and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. 
  The following table provides a reconciliation between income (loss) from continuing operations and diluted income (loss) from continuing operations per share attributable to Encore calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted income from continuing operations per share attributable to Encore, respectively. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes the effect of approximately   0.8 million   common shares, that are issuable upon conversion of certain convertible senior notes because the average stock price during the period exceeded the conversion price of these notes. However, as described in Note   10  ,  Debt Encore Convertible Notes,  in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have certain hedging transactions in place that have the effect of increasing the effective conversion price of these notes. Accordingly, while these common shares are included in our diluted earnings per share, the hedge transactions will offset the impact of this dilution and no shares will be issued unless our stock price exceeds the effective conversion price, thereby creating a discrepancy between the accounting effect of those notes under GAAP and their economic impact. 
  Because we reported GAAP net loss from continuing operations attributed to Encore during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the shares used to calculate GAAP net loss per diluted share - accounting and GAAP net loss per diluted share - economic during the periods exclude dilutive potential common shares because of their anti-dilutive effect. After the non-GAAP adjustments however, we reported non-GAAP adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore, the shares used to calculate non-GAAP adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore per share, both accounting and economic, were approximately 25,911,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 accounting and economic shares were approximately 26,507,000 and 25,679,000, respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, amounts relate to the consent order with the CFPB that we entered into in September 2015. We believe these fees and expenses are not indicative of ongoing operations and adjusting for these fees and expenses makes it easier to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors  results.

    As we continue to acquire debt solution service providers around the world, the acquired intangible assets, such as trade names and customer relationships, have grown substantially, particularly in recent quarters. These intangible assets are valued at the time of the acquisition and amortized over their estimated lives. We believe that amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, especially the amortization of an acquired company s trade names and customer relationships, is the result of pre-acquisition activities. In addition, the amortization of these acquired intangibles is a non-cash static expense that is not affected by operations during any reporting period. As a result, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets is excluded from our adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore and adjusted income from continuing operations per share.

Adjusted EBITDA.   Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, portfolio amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, one-time charges, acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses, and settlement fees and related administrative expenses), which is materially similar in calculation to a financial measure contained in covenants used in the Encore revolving credit and term loan facility, in the evaluation of our operations and believes that this measure is a useful indicator of our ability to generate cash collections in excess of operating expenses through the liquidation of our receivable portfolios.

Adjusted Operating Expenses.   Management utilizes adjusted operating expenses in order to facilitate a comparison of approximate cash costs to cash collections for our portfolio purchasing and recovery business. Adjusted operating expenses for our portfolio purchasing and recovery business are calculated by starting with GAAP total operating expenses and backing out stock-based compensation expense, operating expenses related to non-portfolio purchasing and recovery business, one-time charges, acquisition, integration and restructuring related operating expenses, and settlement fees and related administrative expenses.  Adjusted operating expenses related to our portfolio purchasing and recovery business for the periods presented are as follows   (in thousands):

  Supplemental Performance Data 
  The tables included in this supplemental performance data section include detail for purchases, collections and estimated remaining collections ( ERC ) by year of purchase. During any fiscal quarter in which we acquire an entity that has portfolio, the entire historical portfolio of the acquired company is aggregated into static pools for the quarter of acquisition based on common characteristics, resulting in pools for that quarter that may consist of several different vintages of portfolio. These quarterly pools are included in the tables in this section by year of purchase. For example, with the acquisition of Cabot in July 2013, all of Cabot s historical portfolio to the date of the acquisition (which includes several years of historical purchases at various stages of maturity) is included in 2013 for Europe. Additional examples include, but are not limited to, the acquisition of Marlin in 2014 and the acquisition of dlc in 2015. 
  Our collection expectations are based on demographic data, account characteristics, and economic variables. Additional adjustments are made to account for qualitative factors that may affect the payment behavior of our consumers and servicing related adjustments to ensure our collection expectations are aligned with our operations. Our collection expectations vary between types of portfolio and geographic location. For example, in the U.K., due to the higher concentration of payment plans, as compared to the U.S. and other locations in Europe, we expect to receive streams of collections over longer periods of time. As a result, past performance of pools in certain geographic locations or of certain types of portfolio are not necessarily a suitable indicator of future results in other locations or for other types of portfolio. 
  The supplemental performance data presented in this section is impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating financial results where the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has an unfavorable reporting impact on our international purchases, collections, and ERC, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has a favorable impact on our international purchases, collections, and ERC. 
  We utilize proprietary forecasting models to continuously evaluate the economic life of each pool. 
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we revised the forecasting methodology we use to value and calculate IRRs on certain portfolios in Europe by extending the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months. This change was  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

made as a result of (1) our observation that older portfolios in Europe have consistently experienced cash collections beyond 120 months, (2) an expectation that regulatory changes in the United Kingdom resulting in a reduction in the number of highly discounted near term one-time settlements, an increase in the number of payment plans, and an increase in the length of existing payment plans will cause a lengthening of our collections curve, (3) an expectation that, as a result of a higher percentage of semi-performing account purchases in the United Kingdom in recent years, newer vintages will have a larger percentage of collections after 120 months and (4) our increased confidence in our ability to forecast future cash collections to 180 months. The increase in the collection forecast from 120 months to 180 months was applied effective July 1, 2016, to certain portfolios in Europe for which we could accurately forecast through such term. For portfolios in Europe that were not extended to 180 months,  we will continue to include collection forecast to 120 months in calculating accretion revenue and in our estimated remaining collection disclosures. In the United States, we will continue to include collection forecast to 120 months in calculating accretion revenue. Expected collections beyond the 120 month collection forecast in the United States are included in our estimated remaining collection disclosures but are not included in the calculation of accretion revenue.

  Liquidity 
  The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, including the cash flows from discontinued operations, for the periods presented   (in thousands)  : 

Operating Cash Flows 
  Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income for non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, allowance charges and stock-based compensation charges, and changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $85.3 million   and   $63.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash provided by operating activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily related to net income of   $5.5 million  , adjustments for discontinued operations, various non-cash add backs in operating activities, including portfolio allowance charges, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily related to net income of   $45.8 million  , adjustments for discontinued operations, various non-cash add backs in operating activities, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
  Investing Cash Flows 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $91.6 million   and   $354.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The cash flows used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were primarily related to receivable portfolio purchases of   $712.7 million  , offset by collection proceeds applied to the principal of our receivable portfolios in the amount of   $507.6 million   and   $106.0 million   of p  roceeds from divestiture of Propel, net of cash divested  . The

     Table of Contents  

cash flows used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to cash paid for the dlc Acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $236.2 million, receivable portfolio purchases (excluding the portfolios acquired from the dlc Acquisition of $216.0 million) of $550.0 million, offset by collection proceeds applied to the principal of our receivable portfolios in the amount of $488.2 million. 
  Capital expenditures for fixed assets acquired with internal cash flows were   $16.5 million   and   $15.8 million   for   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Financing Cash Flows 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $13.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Net cash provided by financing activities was   $345.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Net cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations was $15.5 million during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $37.0 million during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  The cash provided by financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily reflects   $455.8 million   in borrowings under our credit facilities, offset by   $444.0 million   in repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. The cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects   $911.6 million   in borrowings under our credit facilities, offset by   $471.6 million   in repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and $33.2 million in repurchases of our common stock. 
  Capital Resources 
  Historically, we have met our cash requirements by utilizing our cash flows from operations, bank borrowings, convertible debt offerings, and equity offerings. From time to time, depending on the capital markets, we consider additional financings to fund our operations and acquisitions. Our primary cash requirements have included the purchase of receivable portfolios, the acquisition of U.S. and international entities, operating expenses, the payment of interest and principal on borrowings, and the payment of income taxes. 
  On March 24, 2016, we amended our revolving credit facility and term loan facility pursuant to Amendment No. 3 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the  Restated Credit Agreement ). The Restated Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit facility of $742.6 million (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), a term loan facility of $158.8 million (the  Term Loan Facility , and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the  Senior Secured Credit Facilities ), and an accordion feature that allows us to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250.0 million ($55.0 million of which was exercised in November 2015). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities have a five-year maturity, expiring in February 2019, except with respect to two subtranches of the Term Loan Facility of $60.0 million and $6.3 million, expiring in February 2017 and November 2017, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $701.0 million   outstanding and   $175.6 million   of availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, excluding the $195.0 million available under the accordion. 
  On October 6, 2016, Cabot Financial (Luxembourg) S.A. ( Cabot Financial ), an indirect subsidiary of Encore, issued  350 million (approximately   $442.6 million  ) in aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the  Cabot 2023 Notes ). The majority of the proceeds from the offering were used to redeem in full the    265.0 million  ,   10.375%   Cabot 2019 Senior Secured Notes and partially repay amounts outstanding under the Cabot Credit Facility. 
  Through Cabot Financial (UK) Limited ( Cabot Financial UK ), an indirect subsidiary, we have a revolving credit facility (the  Cabot Credit Facility ), the Cabot Credit Facility was amended on October 6, 2016 that increased the total commitment amount from  200.0 million to  250.0 million. The Cabot Credit Facility includes an uncommitted accordion facility that will allow the facility to be increased by an additional  50.0 million, subject to obtaining the requisite commitments and compliance with the terms of Cabot Financial UK s other indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had    88.0 million   (approximately   $114.3 million  ) outstanding and    112.0 million   (approximately   $145.5 million  ) of availability under the Cabot Credit Facility. 
  Currently, all of our portfolio purchases are funded with cash from operations and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Cabot Credit Facility. 
  We are in compliance with all covenants under our financing arrangements. See Note   10  ,  Debt  to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our debt. 
  Our cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   consisted of $35.5 million held by U.S.-based entities and $122.1 million held by foreign entities. Most of our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign entities is indefinitely reinvested and

may be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. However, we believe that our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the United States and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds. 
  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, given our expectation of continued positive cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents, our access to capital markets, and availability under our credit facilities. Our future cash needs will depend on our acquisitions of portfolios and businesses. The divestiture of Propel provided liquidity to deleverage our company and paid down our debt. Additionally, it is expected to improve our overall corporate return on invested capital and provide us additional liquidity for increased investment capital flexibility. 
   
  Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.   We have operations in foreign countries, which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary risk of loss due to foreign currency exchange rate risk is related to Euro to British Pound and Indian rupee to U.S. dollar exchange rates. We continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable. Such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. 
  Beginning in 2016, we have currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the British Pound and Euro. These derivative contracts generally mature within one to three months and are not designated as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. The gains or losses on these derivative contracts are recognized in other income or expense based on the changes in fair value. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that hedge our risk of foreign currency exchange between the British Pound and Euro with a fair value asset position of approximately $0.8 million. The functional currency of the subsidiary that carries the hedge contracts is British Pound and the reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% between the British Pound and the Euro and 10% between the British Pound and U.S. dollar could be experienced in the near term. If the Euro weakened by 10% against the British Pound and the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% against the British Pound as of September 30, 2016, the result would have an unfavorable effect to the fair value of the derivatives by approximately $17.5 million. If the Euro strengthened by 10% against the British Pound and the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% against the British Pound as of September 30, 2016, the result would have a favorable effect to the fair value of the derivatives by approximately $15.8 million. 
  In addition, we have currency exchange forward contracts that hedge the forecasted monthly cash settlements resulting from the expenses incurred by our operations in India. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of such contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in OCI are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect the Company s earnings. If all or a portion of the forecasted transaction is cancelled, this would render all or a portion of the cash flow hedge ineffective and the Company would reclassify the ineffective portion of the hedge into earnings. The Company generally does not experience ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship and the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any such gains or losses. 
  As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that hedge our risk of foreign currency exchange against the Indian rupee had a fair value asset position of $0.6 million. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for the Indian rupee could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% at September 30, 2016 this would have a negative impact to the fair value of the hedge of approximately $2.6 million. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% at September 30, 2016 this would have a positive impact to the fair value of the hedge of approximately $4.6 million.  
  Interest Rates.   At   September 30, 2016  , there had not been a material change in the interest rate risk information disclosed in Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 4   Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and accordingly, management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  Based on their most recent evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
