(Unaudited) 

1. BUS  INESS 

Nature of Operations   Fantex, Inc. (the  Company  or  Fantex ) was incorporated in Delaware in September 2012 and is a subsidiary of Fantex Holdings, Inc. (the  Parent ). Fantex has substantially relied on the Parent to date to conduct its operations. 

Fantex is a company that has acquired a minority interest in the future income of 20 professional athletes (together with affiliated entities, the  Contract Party,  and collectively, the  Contract Parties ). The Company does not intend to acquire any additional minority interests in the earnings of professional athletes. The Company s business operation will consist of manintaining and administering its contracts with each of its 20 Contract Parties. Further, the Company intends to reduce its shareholder count to below 300 and to suspend its public reporting obligations. The business operates in a single segment.  

The Company currently relies on the Parent for management and operational capabilities. The Company will continue to rely on the Parent to conduct its operations until such time as the Company s income and cash flows are sufficient to finance operations. 

The Company operates under a management agreement with the Parent, pursuant to which the Parent provides Fantex with management and administrative services, including providing and compensating the Company s executive management and other personnel, as well as services relating to information technology support, brand management and other support operations, facilities, human resources, tax planning and administration, accounting, treasury and insurance. The Company will begin to assume direct management and administrative responsibilities at such time in the future as the actual cost of these services is less than the service fee to the Parent. See Note 3,  Related Party Transactions  for further discussion.  

All expenses except for the management fee incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were paid by the Parent and allocated to Fantex based on the expenses incurred by Fantex in its operations. The allocations were based on the time spent by employees of the Parent on activities of Fantex and direct expenses incurred for the operations of Fantex. The expense allocations have been determined on the basis that Fantex and the Parent considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by Fantex. Management believes that the expenses allocated to Fantex are representative of the operating expenses it would have incurred had Fantex been operating on a stand-alone basis. 

Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties    The Company is an early stage company and as such has not yet been able to demonstrate the long term viability of its business model. The Company can be affected by a variety of factors. Management of the Company believes that the following areas represent some of the more significant risks that could have a significant negative effect on the Company in terms of its future financial position, results of operations or cash flows: 

The Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future.     

The Company has a limited operating history which may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of its business to date and to assess its future viability.     

The Company may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. There is no certainty the Company will be able to raise such additional funding.     

The Company s principal source of cash flows for the foreseeable future will be derived from brand contracts, and with respect to brand contracts:     

the Company has limited experience managing brand contracts and limited historical performance data about its brand contracts;     

7 

Table of Contents  

the Company does not have any rights to require the Contract Party to take any actions to attract, maintain or otherwise generate brand income;     

brand income may decrease due to factors outside the control of the Contract Party, such as a decline in relative performance, injury, illness, medical condition or death of the Contract Party, or due to other factors such as public scandal or other reputational harm to the Contract Party;     

the valuation of the Company s brand contracts and expected ABI requires the Company to make material assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect;     

changes in government policy, legislation or regulatory interpretations could cause our business operations or offerings of tracking stocks to become subject to additional regulatory or legal requirements that may adversely affect our business operations and ability to offer additional tracking stocks; and      

the leagues, team owners, players associations, endorsement partners, elected officials or others may take actions that could restrict the Company s ability or make it more costly for the Company to enter into future brand contracts.     

The Company is dependent on the continued ability of the Parent to support operations until such time as the Company is capable of supporting its own operations.     

Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40); Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . This update requires management of the Company to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. This update is effective for the annual period ending after   December 15, 2016, and for the annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the financial statements.   Upon adoption, this standard may affect disclosures but would not affect the Company s balance sheet, statement of operations, or statement of cash flows  . 		 

Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the entire year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of Fantex s condensed financial statements have been included and are of a normal recurring nature. 

Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management will evaluate these estimates, including those related to fair values of brand contracts, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. Estimates will be based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

A tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or  track  the economic performance of a particular business or  group , and in the Company s case, the economic performance of the related brand contract, rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the tracking stocks have separate collections of assets and liabilities attributed to them, no brand contract is a separate legal entity and therefore no brand contract can own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. 

Holders of tracking stocks have no direct claim to the attributed net assets of the tracking stock and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of Fantex, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of Fantex.  

3. RELAT  ED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Company will continue to rely on the Parent to conduct its operations until such time as the Company s cash flows are sufficient to finance its operations. The Company operates under a management agreement with the Parent, pursuant to which the Parent provides Fantex with management and administrative services, including providing and compensating the Company s executive management and other personnel, as well as services relating to information technology support, brand management and other support operations, facilities, human resources, tax planning and administration, accounting, treasury and insurance. The Company will begin to assume direct management and administrative responsibilities at such time in the future as the actual cost of these services is less than the service fee to the Parent, which is not anticipated to occur until the Company begins to generate significant cash flows from multiple brand contracts. 

Under the terms of the management agreement as in effect during the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has agreed to pay the Parent 5% of the amount of the gross cash received by the Company, if any, pursuant to the brand contracts during any quarterly period as remuneration for the services provided. The amount of gross cash received used to calculate this 5% fee will include any portion allocated to a reduction of the carrying value on the financial statements but shall not take into account the changes in fair value of the brand contracts. As such, the service fee under the management agreement will be determined based on the total amount of actual cash received under the brand contracts in a given quarterly period prior to any adjustments for fair value and without regard to the expected cash receipts in such quarter as reflected in the financial statements for that quarter. To the extent the Company receives no cash for any period then the Company would not owe any fee for any services

provided during that period. The Company may evaluate the service fee from time to time to assess the continued appropriateness of the percentage of its cash receipts upon which the service fee is calculated, in light of the services being provided by the Parent at the time and the cost of those services. On July 22, 2016, the Company and Parent amended the management agreement to provide that the Company will not pay any remuneration to the Parent in respect of gross cash received by the Company pursuant to the 14 brand contracts linked to its Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock. 

The Company incurred management fee expenses pursuant to the management agreement of $3,882 and $4,004 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $70,552 and $23,289 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The management fee is included in the total expenses of $680,195 and $899,681 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $3,038,621 and $3,230,407 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The management fee represents a cash payment in lieu of an allocation from the Parent for the expenses to operate the Company. 

All expenses (except the management fee expense incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015) were paid by the Parent and allocated to Fantex based on the time spent by employees of the Parent on activities of Fantex, the number of full time equivalent employees performing Fantex activities and direct expenses incurred for the operations of Fantex. The expense allocations have been determined on the basis that Fantex and the Parent considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by Fantex and the methodology and assumptions made in the allocations have been consistently applied and are comparable in the periods presented. Management believes that the expenses allocated from the Parent to Fantex, together with the management fee payable by the Company to the Parent under the management agreement, are representative of the operating expenses Fantex would have incurred had it been operated on a stand-alone basis. 		 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Parent incurred and allocated to the Company $674,836 and $895,406 respectively, and $2,964,901 and $3,157,917 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of expenses directly related to the operations of Fantex. The Company converted to capital all the amounts that were allocated by the Parent to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Additionally, the Parent made cash contributions of $885,231 to capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

In 2013, the five independent directors of the Company were granted an aggregate of 100,000 non-qualified options under the Fantex Holdings, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. These options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Parent s common stock at the date of grant and have a 10-year contractual term. The stock options vest ratably over a four-year period. The fair market value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the Company used the following methods to determine its underlying assumptions: expected volatilities are based on the historical volatilities of the daily closing price of the public common stock of companies believed comparable to the Parent; the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method of using the mid-point between the vesting term and the original contractual term and/or average time outstanding method; the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury daily yield curve on the date of grant; and the expected dividend yield is based on the current dividend trend. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 		 

The Company was allocated from the Parent $6,082 and $18,135 of stock compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $6,082 and $18,312, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The key assumptions used by the Parent in the valuation model to value the stock option grants were:

Table of Contents  

The fair value of the options as computed under the Black-Scholes valuation model was calculated to be $0.967 per share. As of September 30, 2016 there are 20,055 shares and $19,392 of compensation expense to be expensed over the remaining 10 month vesting period. 

Certain expenses related to securities offerings have been paid by the Parent, and those costs will remain the liability of the Parent. The Parent will not seek to recapture these expenses from the Company.   The following table summarizes the related party transactions involving the initial public offerings completed since January 1, 2014 until September 30, 2016 which were underwritten by the Company s affiliated broker-dealer, Fantex Brokerage Services, LLC.

Includes 34,414 shares of Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery, 18,000 shares of Fantex Series Michael Brockers and 13,400 shares of Fantex Series Jack Mewhort purchased by Lily Beirne, the spouse of David Beirne, the Chairman of our Parent s Board of Directors.     

On July 22, 2016, the Company completed the private placement sale of $59,336,580 of its Fantex Sports Portfolio 1 Units pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Private Placement ). The Parent and certain directors of the Parent purchased an aggregate of 3,083,658 Units in the Private Placement. Immediately prior to the closing of the Private Placement, the Company repurchased shares of the tracking stocks listed below from the Parent and certain of the Parent s directors and related persons. These shares were originally acquired from the Company in connection with the initial public offering of these tracking stocks. Following such repurchase by the Company, these shares were included in the Fantex Sports Portfolio 1 Units. The Parent and certain directors of the Parent subsequently purchased Fantex Sports Portfolio Units in the offering. The table below summarizes these transactions.  

See Note 8 for a further discussion of the Private Placement.  

4. INVEST  MENT IN BRAND CONTRACTS, AT FAIR VALUE 

Brand contracts, at fair value, are initially valued at the transaction price. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s brand contracts are considered Level 3 investments because there are no reliable observable market prices for these investments. The Company employs discounted cash flow valuation models that depend on several observable and unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining fair value for Level 3 investments,   

11 

Table of Contents  

including: the risk free cost of capital, length of playing career, length of post career, future rates of inflation in salaries and endorsement contracts, and projections of amounts that may be realized through future playing and endorsement contracts. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by brand contract and in the application of the Company s valuation methodologies. The reported fair value estimates could vary materially if the Company had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs or other assumptions for applicable investments. 

The Company generally considers three categories of potential brand income: 

Category A   Potential brand income related to the portions of existing contracts that have a higher degree of certainty of payment, such as brand income that is very near-term or that is guaranteed under existing included contracts.     

Category B   Potential brand income related to the portions of existing contracts that have a lesser degree of certainty of payment, such as brand income that is payable pursuant to existing included contracts but that depends on longer-term continued satisfactory performance of the Contract Party.     

Category C   Potential brand income related to anticipated future contracts or non-contracted earnings, such as future endorsements, playing contracts, tour earnings and/or additional brand income generated from coaching, broadcasting or the like.     

As of September 30, 2016 the Company had 20 brand contracts that are generating income and subject to fair value measurement. The following describes the valuation methodology and significant unobservable inputs used for these brand contracts that is categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Discount Rates 

In determining the fair value of the Company s brand contracts as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company used discount rates ranging from 4.5% to 25.0%, which the Company believes adequately address the uncertainty inherent in its estimates. 

Career Length 

To determine a Contract Party s expected career length for the brand contracts, the Company s valuation professionals used proprietary valuation models. For athletes in the National Football League ( NFL ) or Major League Baseball ( MLB ), the Company s valuation professionals, using statistical analysis determined a set of players that were comparable in caliber to the Contract Party and, based on the career lengths of the players in the data set, arrived at an estimated career length for the Contract Party.  

Player Contract Values 

In estimating the value of the future player contracts for Contract Parties in the NFL or MLB, the Company reviewed the contracts for players in the professional sport, retired or active, who are of similar caliber to the applicable Contract Party, who have entered into contracts in a similar era, and who are or were at similar ages and stages in their careers at which the applicable Contract Party is expected to enter into additional player contracts. The values of such contracts are adjusted for inflation to better predict the contract values of any future player contracts. 

Professional Golf Cash Flows 

Due to the tournament structure of professional golf, the Company reviewed yearly earnings for retired and active professional golfers that are or were at similar ages and stages in their careers in order to forecast the amount and timing of future cash flows for the Contract Party.

Table of Contents  

Level 3 Assets 

The Investments in Brand Contracts at fair value was determined to be $69,504,480 as of September 30, 2016. 

The following tables present additional data about our Level 3 assets measured at fair value. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of the contract within the Level 3 category. As a result, unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in the fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.  

Changes in Level 3 assets measured at fair value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

(1) 

Unrealized gains include an increase in   present value for the period from the ABI date (i.e. the contract inception date) through June 30, 2016 of approximately $3.7 million in aggregate for these contracts.     

(1) 

Unrealized gains include an increase in   present value for the period from the ABI date (i.e. contract inception date) through June 30, 2016 of approximately $4.4 million in aggregate for these contracts.

The Company recognizes gains and losses under the following circumstances: 

Realized gains result from the collection of cash in the current period.      

Realized losses result from cash that was previously expected to be received that is no longer expected to be received.      

Unrealized gains are primarily a result of the passage of time bringing future cash flows closer to the present or a result of increases in the estimated amount of future cash flows.      

Unrealized losses are primarily a result of changes in the timing of estimated cash flows from one period to a subsequent period or decreases in the estimated amounts of future cash flows.      

Balances in the  Receivable from Contract Party  column represent amounts paid to the Contract Party but which have not yet been remitted to the Company under the applicable brand contract. Such amounts are shown on the Condensed Balance Sheets and in the table above as  Receivable from Contract Parties . Once collected by the Company, these amounts are shown in the  Payments on Brand Contracts  column in the tables above.

The below table summarizes the brand contracts purchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and ABI paid to the Company from the ABI effective date through September 30, 2016.  

(1) 

Represents 100% of the contracted purchase price as defined under the respective brand contracts. The Company paid 5% of the contracted purchase price as defined under the respective brand contracts during the second quarter of 2016. The remaining 95% was paid on the brand contract purchase dates indicated in the table above.     

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s brand contracts are discount rates, career length, comparable NFL contract values, and comparable MLB and professional golf annual cash flows.

5. INCO  ME TAXES 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized. 

Deferred tax assets consisted of the following: 

Because of the Company s limited operating history and cumulative loss, management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax asset will not be realized. Therefore, the Company provided a full valuation allowance of $4,247,000 and $6,998,000 against the deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The federal statutory income tax rate of 35% is offset by the valuation allowance to reconcile to the effective income tax rate of 0%.

Table of Contents  

As of September 30, 2016 the Company has federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $5,659,000 and $1,300,000, respectively, which will expire at various dates from 2032 through 2036. Such net operating loss carryforwards will expire as follows: 

The Company adopted a policy to classify accrued interest and penalties as part of the accrued liability for uncertain tax positions, if any, in the provision for income taxes. No accrued interest or penalties were recorded as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date. 

The Company files income tax returns in federal and state jurisdictions. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all tax years were open and may be subject to potential examination in one or more jurisdictions. There are no ongoing examinations by taxing authorities at this time. 

6. INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE 

The Company computes net income (loss) per share of its platform common stock and tracking stocks using the two-class method in the financial statements. Basic income (loss) per share ( Basic EPS ) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive common share options or unvested restricted common shares.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company's capital structure consists of eight series of common stocks as listed on the Company s Condensed Balance Sheets in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In accordance with the Company's management and attribution policies, the Company attributes assets, liabilities, income and expenses to its tracking stocks to reflect or "track" the economic performance of the associated brand contract, as defined below. Prior to July 22, 2016, the Company attributed 95% of the ABI from all of its brand contracts to the associated tracking stock and expenses directly attributable to those tracking stocks, such as promotional and marketing-related expenses. On July 22, 2016, the Company and Parent amended the management agreement to provide that the Company will not pay any remuneration to the Parent in respect of gross cash received by the Company pursuant to the 14 brand contracts linked to its Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock. Additionally, the Company attributes to Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock 100% of the ABI from the 14 brand contracts associated with that tracking stock. See Note 2 for additional discussion of tracking stocks.

The holders of the Company s Platform Common Stock and each series of the Company s common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Each series of common stock will vote together as a single class with all other series of common stock, unless otherwise required by law. Delaware law would require holders of a series of stock to vote separately as a single class if the Company were to seek to amend its certificate of incorporation so as to alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one or more series of a class of stock in a manner that adversely affects the holders of such series of stock, but does not so affect the entire class. In such a case, the holders of the affected series would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment. 

At any time following the two-year anniversary of the filing of a certificate of designations creating a new tracking stock, the Company s Board of Directors may resolve to convert such tracking stock into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Platform Common Stock at a conversion ratio to be determined by dividing the fair value of a share of such tracking stock by the fair value of a share of the Company s Platform Common Stock.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes hereto presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. This discussion contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). These statements are often identified by the use of words such as  believes,   estimates,   anticipates,   expects,   plans,   intends,   may,   could,   might,   will,   should,   approximately  or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. Factors that could cause or contribute to such subsequent events and developments include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as incorporated herein. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms  Fantex,   Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Fantex, Inc., a Delaware corporation, unless otherwise noted. 		 

Overview 

We were incorporated on September 14, 2012 in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fantex Holdings, Inc. ( Fantex Holdings,  or our  parent ).  Fantex Holdings was incorporated in Delaware on April 9, 2012 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. We are an early stage company and have relied on our parent to conduct our operations through its employees.  Until recently, our operations have consisted of targeting, evaluating and accessing brands and negotiating the acquisition of minority interests ( acquired brand income  or  ABI ) in the brand income of athletes that meet our criteria.     

During this quarter, we have decided to cease the acquisition of new brand contracts. This decision was made due to the difficulty we encountered in securing financing from unaffiliated parties through the offering of tracking stocks to pay the purchase price for our brand contracts. Since our inception in September, 2012, we have purchased 20 brand contracts at a cost of approximately $69.5 million. Our parent and certain directors, officers and related persons of our parent have provided (through the purchase of our securities in public and private offerings) approximately $33.6 million (48%) of the financing required to purchase these brand contracts. We have taken steps to streamline the business so that we can effectively manage and administer our existing 20 brand contracts. In the coming months, we intend to: 

Decrease the total number of our stockholders to under 300 by implementing a reverse stock split and cashing out stockholders with fewer than one share, which will permit us to suspend our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act;      

Reduce personnel costs attributed to us from our parent company, Fantex Holdings; and,      

Reduce our non-personnel costs to an appropriate level for administering our existing brand contracts and maintaining basic corporate activities (e.g., collection of brand income, maintaining brand contract assets, payment of dividends, continued compliance with all regulatory obligations).      

In addition, during the third quarter our affiliate Fantex Brokerage Services closed its alternative trading system and ceased operations.

Table of Contents  

As of September 30, 2016, we had brand contracts in effect with each of the following contract parties: 

(1) 

In April 20  16, we signe  d brand contracts or amendments to existing contracts and   paid each such Contract Party 5% of the purchase price of that Contract Party s brand contract to consummate 5% of the brand contract.     

We continue to operate under a management agreement with our Parent, who provides us with management and administrative services, including providing and compensating our executive management and other personnel as well as services relating to information technology support, brand management and other support, operations, facilities, human resources, tax planning and administration, accounting, treasury and insurance. However, if our Parent is unable to perform any of the services that it is required to perform under the management agreement, due to financial difficulty or otherwise, then we may be forced to assume management and administrative tasks, and incur additional expenses, sooner than we anticipate. Until such time, we will continue to rely on our Parent to conduct our operations in accordance with the management agreement.   

Brand Contracts Signed and Consummated During the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Results of Operations   

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Income (Loss) from Brand Contracts 

We account for our brand contracts at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in Note 4,  Investment In Brand Contracts, at Fair Value  in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements.  

24 

Table of Contents  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in fair value of our brand contract portfolio resulted in income from brand contracts of $6,541,657 and $446,253, respectively.  

(1) 

Unrealized gains include an increase in   present value for the period from the contract ABI date through June 30, 2016 of approximately $3.7 million in aggregate for these contracts, as a result of the passage of time.     

We completed the consummation of 10 brand contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which resulted in an increase in income from brand contracts of $5.1 million compared to the same quarter of 2015. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, all of our brand contracts performed generally as anticipated, with no changes to the observable inputs used in our fair value determination, except for our brand contract with Michael Brockers. 

In September, 2016, Michael Brockers signed a three year contract extension (through the 2019 NFL season) with the Los Angeles Rams for approximately $33.3 million. This amount is in addition to his current $6.1 million salary for the 2016 NFL season. The addition of new contract cash flows and the change in discount rates on those cash flows increased the fair value of our brand contract with Michael Brockers by approximately $ 0.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

We completed the consummation of one brand contract during the three months ended September 30, 2015. In the three month period ended September 30, 2015, all of our brand contracts performed generally as anticipated, with no changes to the observable inputs used in our fair value determination, except for our brand contract with EJ Manuel. 

25 

Table of Contents  

The decrease in our valuation of the EJ Manuel Brand Contract for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflected an approximately $0.4 million reduction in our estimate of expected ABI under the brand contract. This reduction in estimated ABI under the EJ Manuel Brand Contract resulted from our estimate that EJ Manuel s future endorsement income would decrease, relative to the amounts we had previously projected he would earn, due to his failure to obtain the starting quarterback position for the Buffalo Bills.   We also reviewed the fair value assumptions of his current and future NFL contracts including career length and the composition of comparable contracts. We have concluded that, as of September 30, 2015, these assumptions were reasonable as these comparable contracts included a representative mix of starting, journeymen and back-up quarterback comparable players. 		 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in fair value of our brand contract portfolio resulted in income from brand contracts of $9,740,017 and $1,301,985, respectively. 

(1) 

Unrealized gains include an increase in   present value for the period from the contract ABI date through June 30, 2016 of approximately $4.4 million in aggregate for these contracts, as a result of the passage of time.     

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, each of our brand contracts performed generally as anticipated,   with no changes to the observable inputs used in our fair value determination  , except for our brand contracts with Mohamed Sanu, Vernon Davis, Andrew Heaney, Alshon Jeffery and Michael Brockers. We also consummated 14 brand contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

26 

Table of Contents  

The brand contracts mentioned above had changes to their observable inputs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from our reassessments of future cash flow projections under such brand contracts due to either new player contracts entered into during the period or to player injuries. These changes to observable inputs in our fair value determinations of our brand contracts with Mohamed Sanu, Vernon Davis, Andrew Heaney, Alshon Jeffery and Michael Brockers resulted in an unrealized loss, with respect to such brand contracts, of approximately $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and is shown net of the increase in present value of expected cash flows in the Unrealized Gain (Loss) column above.  

In the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, all of our contracts performed generally as anticipated, except for our contracts with EJ Manuel and Alshon Jeffery.   

The decrease in our valuation of the EJ Manuel Brand Contract for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflected an approximately $0.4 million reduction in our estimate of expected ABI under the brand contract. This reduction in estimated ABI under the EJ Manuel Brand Contract resulted from our estimate that EJ Manuel s future endorsement income would decrease, relative to the amounts we had previously projected he would earn, due to his failure to obtain the starting quarterback position for the Buffalo Bills.   We also reviewed the fair value assumptions of his current and future NFL contracts including career length and the composition of comparable contracts. We have concluded that, as of September 30, 2015, these assumptions were reasonable as these comparable contracts included a representative mix of starting, journeymen and back-up quarterback comparable players. 		 

In our initial valuation of the Alshon Jeffery Brand Contract, we estimated that Alshon Jeffery would renegotiate his contract prior to the 2015 NFL season and receive a six year, $79.4 million contract including a $17.8 million signing bonus and that in 2021, he would sign a two year, $20.7 million contract with a $1.5 million signing bonus. During the second quarter of 2015, we concluded he would not renegotiate his contract prior to the beginning of the 2015 NFL season. As a result of this change, we performed a revaluation of Alshon Jeffery s comparable contracts as of June 30, 2015. The decrease in the value of comparable NFL player contracts resulted in a decrease in the fair value of Alshon Jeffery s Brand Contract. As of June 30, 2015, we estimated that Alshon Jeffery would sign a six year, $76.8 million contract with an $18.3 million signing bonus before the beginning of the 2016 NFL season and in 2022, he would sign a one year, $7.5 million contract with a $1.6 million signing bonus. See   Note 4,  Investment In Brand Contracts, At Fair Value in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements,    for the effects of changes of unobservable inputs on the fair values of brand contracts. 		 

The changes in our estimates for the timing and amounts of these new cash flows as a result of the above revaluation resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately $1.8 million for the Alshon Jeffery Brand Contract recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This unrealized loss was partially offset by an increase in the net present value of expected cash flows from this brand contract of approximately $1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

We made no other material changes to our assumptions in determining brand income for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 other than as described above.

Income from Other Investments 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded income of $10,400 from our 10% ownership interest in Jamba Juice franchises in connection with our brand contract with Vernon Davis. We did not record any income from this investment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Operating Expenses  

The operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflect costs incurred to develop and operate our business. All such costs to date except those under our management agreement with our Parent, have been allocated to us from our Parent. Expenses such as personnel and facility costs were primarily allocated based on the estimated number of full time equivalent (FTE) employees working on activities associated with us. All personnel costs were allocated based on an estimated percentage of time spent on our activities. Facility costs were allocated based on the FTE employees associated with us as a percentage of all employees of our Parent. All other costs were specifically identified and charged to us as determined by management. All estimates are deemed to be reasonable and reflect, in the best judgment of our management, the costs associated with our activities. 

Comparison of Operating Expenses for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

We currently have no employees, but are being supported by personnel employed by our Parent. The decrease in personnel costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflects the resignation of our Chief Financial Officer effective August 1, 2016 and the elimination of product management staffing.  Our FTE employees are involved in activities related to brand contract maintenance, valuations and compliance with public company reporting requirements.  

Professional services consist primarily of legal, audit and marketing services. The decrease in professional services during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was the result of cost associated with regulatory filings and costs associated with maintaining the brand agreements which occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and did not repeat in the same period of 2016.  We believe that our overall professional services-related spending will decrease from these current levels as we eliminate our activities around brand contract acquisition and transform the business into maintaining and servicing our brand contract assets. 

General and administrative expenses, exclusive of personnel costs, consist primarily of the allocation of facility, insurance and travel-related costs. Lower insurance and travel related costs were offset by higher facilities costs which kept overall general and administrative expenses flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Comparison of Operating Expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The increase in personnel costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects an additional 1.0 FTE employee being allocated to us by our Parent and a net increase in the salary of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to their employment agreements with our Parent compared to the same period of 2015 offset by reductions in product management personnel costs. Our FTE employees during those periods were involved in activities related to brand contract acquisitions, valuations and compliance with public company reporting requirements.  

Professional services consist primarily of legal, audit and marketing services. The decrease in professional services during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was the result of a $336,000 decrease in marketing expenses and an $80,000 decrease in legal expenses, offset by a $113,000 increase in audit, compliance and regulatory costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred costs associated with brand platform and athlete development initiatives that did not recur in the corresponding period of 2016. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred legal costs in connection with the Michael Brockers and Jack Mewhort offerings as well as public company compliance costs which also did not recur in the corresponding period in 2016.  We believe that our overall professional services-related spending will decrease from these current levels as we move the business into maintaining and servicing our brand contract assets. 		 

General and administrative expenses, exclusive of personnel costs, consist primarily of the allocation of facility, insurance and travel-related costs. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily due to increases in facility costs of approximately $37,000 and travel and entertainment costs related to marketing activities in the early part of 2016 of approximately $33,000.  We believe that these should decrease over time as we reduce costs for travel and entertainment. 

As our operations continue, we expect to continue to incur expenses of the type and nature described above. In addition, we expect to incur additional management fees pursuant to our management agreement with our Parent. The table below summarizes the management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

These fees represent 5% of the cash receipts from our brand contracts. Future fees will be dependent upon the cash received from our brand contracts. On July 22, 2016, we and our Parent amended the management agreement to provide that we will not pay any remuneration to our Parent in respect of gross cash received by us pursuant to the 14 brand contracts linked to our Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock. 

Interest Expense 

On February 12, 2016, we   borrowed $3,300,000 from our Parent under a promissory note bearing interest at 8% per annum, the proceeds of which were used to consummate the Andrew Heaney brand contract. On April 28, 2016, the note was amended to be a secured non-recourse promissory note. On April 28, 2016, we borrowed an additional $9,000,000 from our Parent under a secured non-recourse promissory note bearing interest at 10% per annum, the proceeds of which were used to consummate the Kendall Wright, Terrance Williams and Ryan Shazier

brand contracts. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $71,133 and $330,567, respectively.  All outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under such promissory notes was repaid in full on July 22, 2016 with the proceeds from our private placement offering.         

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

To date, we have relied significantly on our Parent for liquidity and capital resources.  

On February 12, 2016, w  e borrowed $3,300,000 from our Parent under a promissory note bearing interest at 8% per annum. We used the proceeds of this note to consummate the Andrew Heaney brand contract. On April 28, 2016, we and our Parent amended the promissory note to clarify that the only recourse under the promissory note was to the Andrew Heaney Brand Contract. This note was fully repaid on July 22, 2016 with the proceeds from our private placement offering of 5,933,658 Fantex Sports Portfolio 1 Units. 

On February 12, 2016, we paid the $3,340,000 purchase price (less $167,000 held in escrow until six months of payment of brand amounts have been timely delivered to us) as consideration for brand income as defined under the Andrew Heaney Brand Contract. Andrew Heaney paid to us $33,459 due under the terms of the Andrew Heaney Brand Contract for the period from January 1, 2015 through February 12, 2016.    

On April 28, 2016, we   borrowed an additional $9,000,000 from our Parent under a secured non-recourse promissory note (the  Secured Note ) bearing interest at 10% per annum. We used the proceeds of the Secured Note to consummate our brand contracts with Kendall Wright, Terrance Williams and Ryan Shazier.  Under the terms of the Secured Note and the related security agreement, the Secured Note was secured solely by our right, title and interest in and to our brand contracts with Kendall Wright, Terrance Williams and Ryan Shazier. All outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under the Secured Note was fully repaid on July 22, 2016 with proceeds from our private placement offering of 5,933,658 Fantex Sports Portfolio 1 Units.  

On April 29, 2016, we   consummated the brand contracts listed in the table below. We paid the purchase price of such brand contracts (less, in each case, a $100,000 advance previously paid and less 5% of the purchase price   held in escrow until six consecutive months of payment of brand amounts have been timely delivered to us)   as consideration for brand income as defined under the Contract Party s brand contract. The Contract Parties paid to us the amounts shown in the following table due under the terms of the Contract Parties  brand contracts for the period from the ABI effective date through March 31, 2016.

Table of Contents  

In April 2016, we signed brand contracts with each Contract Party listed in the table below. Except as otherwise indicated in the table, we   paid each such Contract Party, as well as Scott Langley and Tyler Duffey, 5% of the purchase price of that Contract Party s brand contract to consummate 5% of the brand contract. Under the brand contract with each such Contract Party, we will be entitled to 5% of the Contract Party s ABI. We funded those advance payments through cash contributions to capital from the Parent.

5% of the purchase price was not paid to the Contract Party.     

On July 22, 2016, we completed the private placement offering of 5,933,658 Fantex Sports Portfolio 1 Units (the  Unit ) at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit is comprised of fractional shares from six tracking stocks originally purchased by our Parent and other directors and related persons of our Parent and from one new tracking stock, Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock, which is linked to 14 brand contracts. The composition of the Units is detailed below:  

(1) 

The shares of the tracking stocks included in the Unit were purchased from our Parent and certain directors and officers of our Parent at the selling price. See Note 3,  Related Party Transactions  in the Condensed Financial Statement of this Form 10-Q for further information.

Table of Contents

Each Unit consists of 0.017 shares of Fantex Series Vernon Davis Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series Vernon Davis ), 0.047 shares of Fantex Series EJ Manuel Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series EJ Manuel ), 0.015 shares of Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu ), 0.102 shares of Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery ), 0.043 shares of Fantex Series Michael Brockers Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series Michael Brockers ), 0.033 shares of Fantex Series Jack Mewhort Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series Jack Mewhort ) and 0.765 shares of Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock ( Fantex Series Professional Sports )     

Immediately prior to and contingent upon the consummation of the private placement of the Units, we repurchased an aggregate of 102,454, shares of Fantex Series Vernon Davis, 277,934 shares of Fantex Series EJ Manuel, 88,365 shares of Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu, 603,994 shares of Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery, 255,893 shares of Fantex Series Michael Brockers and 193,534 shares of Fantex Series Jack Mewhort from our Parent and certain directors and related persons of our Parent to include in the Units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.5 million. Our Parent and certain directors of our Parent purchased an aggregate of 3,083,658 Units in the private placement for an aggregate purchase price of $30.8 million. 

We raised $45.4 million of proceeds net of transaction costs in the Private Placement. On July 22, 2016, we repaid $12.6 million in outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest on our two outstanding promissory notes to our Parent. We also completed the acquisition of the twelve partially consummated brand contracts and two unconsummated brand contracts for an aggregate purchase price of $31.0 million. The remaining offering proceeds to us of $3.3 million were used for general working capital purposes. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we completed the initial public offering to consummate the Jack Mewhort brand contract. We raised $2.52 million net of underwriting discounts and expenses, and substantially all of the net proceeds were paid to Jack Mewhort to consummate the Jack Mewhort brand contract.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we completed the initial public offering to consummate the Alshon Jeffery, Michael Brockers and Jack Mewhort brand contracts. We raised approximately $13.9 million net of underwriting discounts and expenses and substantially all of the net proceeds were paid to the contract counter-parties to consummate their respective brand contracts.  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we collected $527,222 and $69,690, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we collected $1,448,110 and $455,380, respectively, from our brand contracts representing our interest in brand income generated by such brand contracts.  

Cash received under our brand contracts will be subject to seasonal variation. For example, the salary under NFL player contracts is usually paid out in even installments during the course of the NFL season, or as a signing bonus according to varying schedules. The NFL season occurs primarily in the third and fourth quarters of each calendar year with lower or no payments coming from NFL contracts in the first and second quarters of the calendar year. The salary under MLB player contracts is usually paid out in even installments during the course of the regular MLB season, or as a signing bonus according to varying schedules. The MLB regular season occurs primarily in the second and third quarters of each calendar year with lower or no payments coming from MLB contracts in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Professional golf is generally played throughout the entire year, but cash flow to professional golfers are directly contingent upon their participation in tournaments and their finishing in a position which receives prize money. 		 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our Parent contributed capital of $674,836 and $895,407, respectively. For the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our Parent contributed capital of $3,850,132 and $3,157,919. The contributed capital includes expenses paid by our Parent on our behalf and allocated to us as expenses and cash contributions of $885,230 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our Parent will continue to fund our liquidity and capital resource needs either through direct cash contributions, non-cash contributed capital for direct and indirect expenses, or a combination of both.

On August 16, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared dividends on the following tracking stocks: 

The dividends were paid September 14, 2016 to all stockholders of record for each security listed in the table above as of the close of business on September 7, 2016. 

On October 20, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a $0.03 per share dividend on our Platform Common Stock. The dividend was payable October 21, 2016 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016. Our Parent, Fantex, Holdings, is the owner of all shares of our Platform Common stock. The dividend totaling $3.0 million was paid to the stockholder of record on October 21, 2016. 

We are not committed to any future capital expenditures and certain agreements, such as rental commitments, are the responsibility of our Parent. We expect, however, that our operations (excluding upfront payments under future brand contracts) will continue to consume cash as we eliminate our activities around brand contract acquisition and transform the business into maintaining and servicing our brand contract assets. 

We are operating under a management agreement with our Parent, pursuant to which our Parent provides us with certain management and administrative services, including providing and compensating our executive management and other personnel, as well as services relating to information technology support, brand management and other support operations, facilities, human resources, tax planning and administration, accounting, treasury and insurance.   

If our Parent is unable to perform any of the services that they are required to perform under the management agreement, due to financial difficulty or otherwise, then we may be forced to assume management and administrative tasks, and incur additional expenses. Until such time, we will continue to rely on our Parent to conduct our operations in accordance with the management agreement. We are dependent on the continued support of our Parent; at this time our Parent intends to continue to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Our Parent has no obligation to continue to finance our operations except as required under our management agreement with them. 

We believe the net proceeds from our offerings together with existing cash and cash equivalents and our Parent s capital contributions will be sufficient to fund our projected capital needs and operating expenses for the next 12 months. However, if our operating and other expenses are higher than we expect or our cash receipts from brand contracts are lower than we expect then we may require higher than expected contributions from our Parent. In any such event, our Parent may need to raise additional capital sooner than expected.  

Management has evaluated our ability to continue as a going concern taking into consideration the liquidity provided by recent private placement.  We analyzed these conditions by analyzing cash inflow from our brand contracts and expense projections. We believe we can continue as a going concern for at least the next 12 months based on those projections. 

Until such time as our operations generate sufficient cash to meet the liquidity needs of our business, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through existing cash balances and reliance on our Parent.

Reverse / Forward Stock Split 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Board of Directors and the majority holder of our common stock, Fantex Holdings, Inc. approved amendments to the Company s   Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s Common Stock par value $0.0001 per share ( Common Stock ), at an exchange ratio of 1-for-200 shares of outstanding Common Stock (the  Reverse Split ), promptly followed by a forward stock split of the Company s outstanding Common Stock, at an exchange ratio of 200-for-1 shares of outstanding Common Stock (the  Forward Split  and together with the Reverse Split, the  Reverse/Forward Split ). 

If given effect, the Reverse/Forward Split would affect any registered stockholder that holds fewer than 200 shares of a specific series of Tracking Stock in his, her or its account immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Split  . However, holders of the Company s Units would not be affected by the Reverse/Forward Split. In addition,   such amendments would not change the par value per share or the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. Holders of less than one share of Fantex Series Vernon Davis Convertible Tracking Stock, Fantex Series EJ Manuel Convertible Tracking Stock, Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu Convertible Tracking Stock, Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery Convertible Tracking Stock, Fantex Series Michael Brockers Convertible Tracking Stock and Fantex Series Jack Mewhort Convertible Tracking Stock as a result of the Reverse Split would be cashed out at the fair value as determined by the Board of Directors using an independent valuation firm.  		 

The primary purpose of the Reverse/Forward Split would be to ensure that the number of holders of our Common Stock will be below 300 so that we can terminate the registration of our Common Stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. If we terminate the registration of our Common Stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and cease to be a reporting company, we expect it would result in the elimination of the expenses related to our disclosure and reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. 

If given effect, we do not currently expect that the Reverse/Forward Split would, in and of itself, affect our current business plan or operations, except for the anticipated cost and management time savings associated with termination of our obligations to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC. If we cease to be a reporting company, we anticipate a reduction in our regulatory compliance and legal costs of approximately $550,000 per year.  

We do not know if or when the Reverse/Forward Split will become effective nor if or when we will terminate the registration of our Common Stock under the Exchange Act and cease to be a reporting company. We also do not know if we will be able to realize any of the anticipated cost savings if we cease to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act. In addition, if given effect, the Reverse/Forward Split may be on different terms than what we currently anticipate, as disclosed above. 

Other Events 

On November 14, 2016 it was announced that Alshon Jeffery has been suspended for four games without pay for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing substances. Pursuant to our brand contract with Alshon Jeffery, he is contractually obligated to pay us ABI due for those four games after they are played. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management will evaluate these estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, fair values of financial instruments, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. Estimates will be based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our financial statements are described below. 		 

34 

Table of Contents  

Fair Value Option 

The brand contracts represent a right to receive certain cash flows from the contract parties, and therefore, the brand contracts meet the definition of a financial asset under GAAP. As financial assets, the brand contracts are precluded from being accounted for as intangible assets. We have elected to account for the brand contracts using the fair value option, with changes in fair value recognized in income (loss) from brand contracts in the statements of operations. We believe measurement of the brand contracts at fair value provides the most meaningful information to users of our financial statements, because the value of the brand contracts may increase or decrease over time based on future events. We believe that recognizing the change in fair value through net income or loss provides a better indicator of the performance of the brand contracts for a given period, enhances transparency, and is more in line with how we manage the risks of the brand contracts. 		 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models may involve a significant level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments  complexity for disclosure purposes. Assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, and are as follows: 		 

Level 1   Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The types of assets generally included in this category are mutual funds.     

Level 2   Inputs are other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.     

Level 3   Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are our brand contracts.     

A significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. 

The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and the current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by our management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our management s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset. The variability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between Levels 1, 2, and/or 3, which our management recognizes at the end of the reporting period. 		 

35 

Table of Contents  

Depending on the relative liquidity in the markets for certain assets, our management may classify assets as Level 3 if they determine that observable quoted prices, obtained directly or indirectly, are not available. Management has determined that all of our contracts should be classified as Level 3. The valuation models used for the assets and liabilities that are valued using Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are described below. 

Valuation Process 

The valuation process for our Level 3 measurements for assets and liabilities will be completed on no less than a quarterly basis, provided that we do not intend to update the on-field statistical performance data used in our valuation models, including those that we used to estimate career longevity and potential future playing contracts, more frequently than on an annual basis based on a full season of on-field statistical performance data, or at such time as there is a material event that we believe would have a long-term material impact on these estimates and the potential brand income resulting from these estimates. The valuation process is designed to subject the valuation of Level 3 investments, including our brand contracts, to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight and review. 

Our internal valuation professionals are responsible for estimating fair value based on various factors including: 

current playing contract including: amounts, duration, incentive provisions, guaranteed portions, if any, termination and other important terms;     

current endorsement contracts, if any, including amounts, duration and contract terms;     

age and health (including injuries) of the individual associated with the brand, duration of career to date and prospects for additional future contracts, both playing and endorsement;     

potential future playing and endorsement contracts, including duration and value;     

position and data specific to that position focused on estimating longevity of career;     

reported contract value increases or decreases for other comparable players (by position and status they hold among their peers (e.g. All Pro, Most Valuable Player, franchise player and the like)) in order to estimate future contract values;     

professional sports league imposed salary caps if appropriate; and     

risk free cost of capital.     

In addition, we consider a number of qualitative factors to develop estimates used in our models, including: 

the stated aspirations and goals of the contract party;     

certain intangibles of the contract party, including media relationships, communication ability,  likeability,  demand as a product endorser, personal drive and ambition;     

social footprint (for example, number of Twitter followers);     

the market in which the contract party performs and how that may impact the number and amount of endorsement opportunities;     

the reach of the brand of the contract party;     

value of TV contracts and the rate of growth in those contracts; and     

attendance trends in the contract party s primary field of performance.     

We consider all of these factors to estimate brand income for use in a discounted cash flow model. These estimates include amounts based on existing contracts as well as our estimates of amounts to be received for anticipated future contracts. With respect to existing contracts, we consider that certain amounts are reasonably assured of realization, but that most earnings from existing contracts depend on continued satisfactory performance. To determine the amount of the purchase price of a brand contract and a current fair value, we apply discount rates to our estimates of earnings. 

36 

Table of Contents  

In general, we apply lower discount rates to amounts associated with existing contracts, particularly portions of those contracts that have a higher degree of certainty of payment, and higher discount rates to amounts associated with future potential earnings under existing contracts and to potential earnings under anticipated future contracts. Further, discount rates rise over time to reflect that uncertainty increases over time. 

Our internal valuation professionals document their considerations of this data that is then reviewed by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. The approved valuation is used to determine the fair value of the brand contract. 

If the estimates of brand income prove to be too high and/or the discount rates used in the calculation prove to be too low, then the valuation of a brand contract may be too high which will result in the recording of a loss on the brand contract. 

Brand Contracts, at Estimated Fair Value 

The negotiated value of our brand contracts, including those brand contracts discussed below and brand contracts with any future contract parties, have been and will continue to be based on a discounted cash flow model using the procedures described above. 

In our analysis we generally consider three categories of potential brand income: 

Category A   Potential brand income related to the portions of existing contracts that have a higher degree of certainty of payment, such as brand income that is very near-term or that is guaranteed under existing included contracts.      

Category B   Potential brand income related to the portions of existing contracts that have a lesser degree of certainty of payment, such as brand income that is payable pursuant to existing included contracts but that depends on longer-term continued satisfactory performance of the contract party.      

Category C   Potential brand income related to anticipated future contracts or non-contracted earnings, such as future endorsements, playing contracts, tour earnings and/or additional brand income generated from coaching, broadcasting or the like.     

Brand Contract Values 

In estimating the value of the brand contracts with all of our contract parties, we review (i) the existing playing contracts of our contract parties, (ii) the playing contracts for other players, retired or active who we believe are of similar caliber to the contract party and who have entered into contracts in a similar era, and are or were at similar stages in their career at which the contract party is expected to enter into additional player contracts. The values of such comparable playing contracts are adjusted for inflation to better predict the contract values of future playing contracts for our contract parties. In addition, we also review the existing endorsement contracts of our contract parties and make certain estimates with respect to future endorsement contracts that our contract parties may receive.  

37 

Table of Contents  

The following table shows the change in fair value of our brand contract portfolio by Category A, Category B and Category C from the inception date of all of our completed brand contracts through September 30, 2016.     

See  Results of Operations   Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  above for discussion of changes in the estimates of certain cash flows and changes in realized and unrealized gains and losses under our brand contracts. 

For additional information on how we estimated the fair values of our brand contracts, see Note 4,  Investment In Brand Contracts, at Fair Value  in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements.   

Income (Loss) From Brand Contracts 

We recognize income or loss based on the change in fair value of the brand contracts from period to period and receipts of payments or other consideration from the brand contracts. Other consideration received by the contract party may include stock, automobiles, or other items of value. In the event other consideration are received by the contract party, we will recognize income from brand contracts equal to our proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the other consideration received, and will receive payment in either cash or such other consideration based on the contractual arrangement. Amounts due to us under the brand contract are either remitted directly from the source of such income or through payment by the contract party. The brand contract stipulates that income once we earn it is not subject to recapture by the contract party. 

For purposes of our financial statements and the notes thereto, cash received under the brand contract will either be recognized as a reduction of our carrying value (i.e., a reduction in the brand contract asset) or income (loss) from brand contracts. Whether cash receipts will be recognized as a reduction in carrying value or income (loss) from brand contracts will depend on the timing of such cash receipt. 

Additionally, the timing of changes in our estimates of future cash flows will impact whether cash receipts are recognized as a reduction of our carrying value or as income (loss) from brand contracts. If, for example, we increase the estimate of cash flows which are not received until a future period, this increase will be recognized as income from brand contracts. If, on the other hand, the cash flows are received in the current period and had not been estimated, the entire cash flow will be recognized as income from brand contracts. 

Expected cash flows will be based on the included contracts the contract party has in place and the expectations of future contracts. As it becomes more likely that the contract party will collect contracted amounts the expected discount rate will decrease. A decrease in the discount rate will result in the receipt of cash primarily being allocated to reduction of carrying value. The discount rates are determined at the purchase date and are revised each period based on the performance of the brand and the likelihood of collection of future contracted amounts. 

Income (loss) from brand contracts is based on an estimate of expected cash flows and the associated expected discount rates. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in the expected performance of the brand or market factors are included in income (loss) from brand contracts in the statements of operations.

We are entitled to certain information and audit rights pursuant to the brand contracts that enable us to adequately calculate and collect the ABI under the brand contract. In addition to such annual audit rights, we proactively monitor and administer our rights under the brand contracts. Following the execution of a brand contract, we prepare a schedule charting the timing and amounts of expected future payments associated with that certain counterparty s existing contracts that are subject to our brand contract, along with the term and the expected timing each contract would be expected to be renegotiated or renewed. We also ensure that all directives to pay Fantex directly have been executed and accepted by the parties making such payments. We contact the contract party at renewal terms to determine whether the contracts will be renewed and take necessary steps to ensure that any new agreements are covered under the brand contract. 

We also review each brand contract quarterly and contact each of our contract parties to determine if the parties entered into additional agreements or renegotiated existing agreements that may impact our ABI. To supplement these direct inquiries, we also monitor social and mainstream media for information relevant to our brand contract or relationship with each of our contract parties, including trade rumors, reports of new endorsements or other agreements that may be subject to our brand contract with such contract parties, reports of renegotiation of existing agreements and reports of personal behavior that may be beneficial or detrimental to the brand contract in general. 

In addition to the above, in the event that expected payments are not received on a timely basis, we attempt to contact the contract party and resolve any issues of nonpayment amicably. If our efforts are unsuccessful, any issues with contract payments will initially be escalated to senior management for resolution. Depending on the nature and materiality of the contract party s nonperformance, we may initiate legal action to recover any unpaid amounts under the brand contract. Significant or continuous nonpayment may be material and may trigger additional disclosure under the Securities Act as well as impair the fair value of the asset on our books. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The current and deferred tax expense is presented under the separate return method. Under the separate return method, Fantex calculates its tax provision as if it were filing a separate tax return. 

Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent management believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations is considered. In the event it is determined that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 

Uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority would be recognized. 

Contractual Obligations 

Our principal contractual obligations are limited to our obligations under our management agreement with our Parent and our brand contracts. We are not committed to any future capital expenditures and certain agreements, such as rental commitments, are the responsibility of our Parent.

Table of Contents  

We have no financial obligations under our consummated brand contracts other than certain indemnity obligations. We have evaluated the impact of these indemnity obligations on our financial statements and determined that they are not material individually or in the aggregate. 

Management Agreement 

We have entered into a management agreement with our Parent, pursuant to which our Parent has agreed to provide us with management and administrative services, including providing and compensating our executive management and other personnel, as well as services relating to information technology support, brand management and other support operations, facilities, human resources, tax planning and administration, accounting, treasury and insurance. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, as of September 30, 2016, we have agreed to pay 5% of the amount of the gross cash received by us, if any, pursuant to our brand contracts (other than the 14 brand contracts linked to our Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock) during any quarterly period as remuneration for the services provided. 

The amount of gross cash received used to calculate this 5% fee will include any portion allocated to reduction in carrying value on our financial statements but will not take into account the changes in fair value of the brand contracts. As such, the service fee under the management agreement will be determined based on the total amount of actual cash received under the brand contracts in a given quarterly period prior to any adjustments for fair value and without regard to the expected cash receipts in such quarter as reflected in the financial statements for that quarter. To the extent we receive no cash for any period then we would not owe any fee for any services provided during that period. We may evaluate the service fee from time to time to assess the continued appropriateness of the percentage of our cash receipts upon which the service fee is calculated, in light of the services being provided by our Parent at the time and cost of those     services  . 		 

The agreement had an initial term through December 31, 2014, and was automatically renewed for a one-year terms through December 31, 2016. It will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year terms each December 31 unless either party provides written notice of its intent not to renew at least three months prior to such renewal. We may also terminate any specific service and/or the agreement, without penalty, with 30 days prior written notice to our Parent. Our Parent may terminate any specific service and/or the agreement with 180 days prior written notice to us, but if we, using our commercially reasonable efforts, are unable to either perform the services ourselves or enter into a reasonable arrangement with a third party to perform the services that we are unable perform ourselves, then our Parent will continue to perform such services for an additional period of 180 days. 

The agreement contains certain provisions requiring us to indemnify our Parent with respect to all losses or damages arising from acts not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, or gross negligence. We have evaluated the impact of these indemnity obligations on our financial statements and determined that they are remote. The management agreement became effective upon the consummation of our first initial public offering on April 28, 2014 and was subsequently amended effective as of July 22, 2016.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 		 

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

			 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.     

Except as otherwise described in the Commission Documents (as defined below), which disclosures qualify these representations and warranties in their entirety, the Company hereby represents and warrants as of the date hereof to, and covenants with, the Purchasers as follows:

All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable; and none of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are subject to any preemptive or similar rights.

The Underlying Shares have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and, when issued to and paid for by the Purchasers (as part of the issuance and purchase of the Units), will be validly-issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Conversion Shares (as defined below) will, prior to issuance, be duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon such conversion by all necessary corporate action and such Conversion Shares, when issued upon such conversion, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The issuance of the Units, the Underlying Shares and the Conversion Shares is not subject to any preemptive or similar rights.   Assuming the accuracy of the representations made by each Purchaser in Section 5, the offer and issuance by the Company of the Units is exempt from registration under the Securities Act.      

4.4 
			             Commission Documents; Financial Statements.

None of the Commission Documents as of their respective dates contained any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of the Company, together with related schedules and notes, included in the Commission Documents comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and   present fairly   in all material respects the financial position, results of operations and changes in financial position of the Company   as of the dates and for the periods indicated, comply as to form with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise noted therein)  .

			 No Material Adverse Change.   Since December 31, 2015,   the Company has not sustained any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Commission Documents; and, since December 31, 2015, (1) there has not been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company, (2) there has not been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, business, prospects, management, financial position, shareholders  equity or results of operations of the

Each franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Commission Documents or to be filed as an exhibit to the Commission Documents under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the    Material Contracts   ) is so described or filed.

All United States federal income tax returns of the Company required by law to be filed have been filed and all taxes shown by such returns or otherwise assessed, which are due and payable, have been paid, except assessments against which appeals have been or will be promptly taken and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. The Company has filed all other tax returns that are required to have been filed by them pursuant to applicable foreign, state, local or other law, except insofar as the failure to file such returns, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a material adverse effect on the general affairs, business, prospects, management, financial position, shareholders  equity or results of operations of the Company, and

The Company is insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged; the Company has not been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for; and the Company has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.      

4.18 
			 Price of Securities.

As consideration for the Repurchased Shares, upon the Closing, the Company will pay to the Parent and such directors and related persons of the Parent an aggregate of approximately $12.5 million out of the gross proceeds to the Company in this offering.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the lost, stolen or destroyed Unit Certificate shall not be at any time enforceable by anyone.  The provisions of this   Section 2.2   are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement of mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Unit Certificates. 		 

ARTICLE 3 

EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER OF UNIT CERTIFICATES

The Unit Agent shall keep, at its corporate trust office, books in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it shall register Unit Certificates and exchanges and transfers of outstanding Unit Certificates, upon surrender of the Unit Certificates to the Unit Agent at its corporate trust office for exchange or registration of transfer, properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of registration of transfer and written instructions for transfer, all in form satisfactory to the Company and the Unit Agent.  No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Unit Certificates, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such exchange or registration of transfer.  Whenever any Unit Certificates are so surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, an authorized officer of the Unit Agent shall manually countersign and deliver to the person or persons entitled thereto a Unit Certificate or Unit Certificates duly authorized and executed by the Company, as so requested.  The Unit Agent shall not be required to effect any exchange or registration of transfer which will result in   

the issuance of a Unit Certificate representing a Unit for a fraction of a Unit Security.  All Unit Certificates issued upon any exchange or registration of transfer of Unit Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same obligations and entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as the Unit Certificate surrendered for such exchange or registration of transfer. 

3.2           Treatment of Holders of Unit Certificates.    The Company, the Unit Agent and all other persons may treat the registered holder of a Unit Certificate as the absolute owner thereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented by the Units represented thereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding. 

3.3           Cancellation of Unit Certificates.    Any Unit Certificate surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer of the Unit represented thereby shall, if surrendered to the Company, be delivered to the Unit Agent and all Unit Certificates surrendered or so delivered to the Unit Agent shall be promptly canceled by the Unit Agent and shall not be reissued and, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, no Unit Certificate shall be issued hereunder in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof.  The Unit Agent shall deliver to the Company from time to time or otherwise dispose of canceled Unit Certificates in a manner satisfactory to the Company.

EXHIBIT D 

FORM OF LEGAL OPINION 

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We have acted as special counsel to Fantex, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), in connection with the issuance and sale on the date hereof at the Closing of up to 5,933,658 Fantex Sports Portfolio 1 Units (the    Units   ), pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of [ ], 2016 (the    Purchase Agreement   ), by and among the Company and the persons and entities listed on Exhibit A thereto (the    Purchasers   ). Each Unit consists of (i) 0.017 shares of Fantex Series Vernon Davis Convertible Tracking Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, (ii) 0.047 shares of Fantex Series EJ Manuel Convertible Tracking Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, (iii) 0.015 shares of Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu Convertible Tracking Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, (iv) 0.102 shares of Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery Convertible Tracking Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, (v) 0.043 shares of Fantex Series Michael Brockers Convertible Tracking Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, (vi) 0.033 shares of Fantex Series Jack Mewhort Convertible Tracking Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and (vii) 0.765 shares of Fantex Series Professional Sports Convertible Tracking Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the convertible tracking stocks described in clauses (i)-(vii), collectively, the    Tracking Stocks   ). Each of the Tracking Stocks is convertible into shares of the Company s platform common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the    Conversion Shares   ). The Tracking Stocks included in the Units are referred to herein as the    Unit Tracking Stocks    and the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of the Unit Tracking Stocks are referred to herein as the    Unit Conversion Shares  .  This letter is furnished pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms defined in the Purchase Agreement, used herein and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement.  		 

As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter, except where a specified fact confirmation procedure is stated to have been performed (in which case we have with your consent performed the stated procedure), and except where a statement is qualified as to knowledge (in which case we have with your consent made no or limited inquiry as specified below). We have examined, among other things, the following: 

(a)  the Purchase Agreement;  

(b)   that certain Unit Agreement, dated July 14, 2016, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC; and 

(c)  The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Certificates of Designations for each of the Tracking Stocks and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (collectively, the    Governing Documents   ). 

The documents described in subsections (a) through (b) above are referred to herein collectively as the    Transaction Agreements  .  

Except as otherwise stated herein, as to factual matters we have, with your consent, relied upon the foregoing, and upon oral and written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others, including the representations and warranties of the Company and the Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement, and certificates of officers of the Company. We have not independently verified such factual matters. Whenever a statement herein is qualified by  to our knowledge  or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that those attorneys in this firm who have rendered legal services in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement do not have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as otherwise expressly indicated, we have not undertaken any independent inquiry to determine the accuracy of any such statement. 

Except as otherwise stated herein, we are opining as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States, the internal laws of the State of California, and in paragraphs 1, 2, 4(b), 4(c) and 5(a) of this letter, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the    DGCL   ), and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or in the case of Delaware, any other laws, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. Except as otherwise stated herein, o  ur opinions are based upon our consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in our experience, are normally applicable to private placements of capital stock. 		 
		 
			 Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, and except as set forth in the Transaction Agreements, including the exhibits and schedules thereto, as of the date hereof: 

1.  The Company is a corporation under the DGCL, with corporate power and authority to enter into the Transaction Agreements and perform its obligations thereunder. With your consent, based solely on certificates from public officials, we confirm that the Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is qualified to do business in the State of California. 

2.  The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Transaction Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by the Company. 

3.  Each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.     

4.  (a) The Unit Tracking Stocks have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when issued, sold and delivered by the Company against payment therefor (as part of the issuance and sale of the Units) in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, will be validly-issued, fully-paid and non-assessable; and (b) the Unit Conversion Shares have been duly reserved, and, if issued upon conversion of one or more of the Unit Tracking Stocks, will be validly-issued, fully-paid and non-assessable.  

5.  The execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the Company, and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Units to the Purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement on the date hereof, do not on the date hereof: (a) violate the provisions of   

the Governing Documents; (b) to our knowledge, violate any federal or State of California statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company; or (c) to our knowledge, require any consents, approvals or authorizations to be obtained by the Company from, or any registrations, declarations or filings to be made by the Company with, any governmental authority, under any federal or State of California statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company on or prior to the date hereof that have not been obtained or made. 

6.  Assuming the truthfulness of the representations of the Purchasers set forth in the Purchase Agreement and an officer of the Company set forth in a certificate of such officer delivered to us in connection herewith, the accuracy of which we have assumed without independent investigation, the Unit Tracking Stocks will, when issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, be issued in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the    Securities Act   ), and the issuance of the Unit Conversion Shares, if issued on the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Governing Documents, would also be exempt from such registration requirements. 		 
		 
			 Our opinions are subject to: 

(a)  the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights or remedies of creditors; 

(b)  the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (  including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief),   concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; 

(c)  the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy;  

(d)    we express no opinion   with respect to (i) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, service of process, arbitration, remedies or judicial relief;     (ii) advance waivers of claims, defenses, rights granted by law or notice, opportunity for hearing, evidentiary requirements, statutes of limitation, trial by jury or at law, or other procedural rights; (iii) waivers of broadly or vaguely stated rights; (iv) covenants not to compete; (v) provisions for exclusivity, election or cumulation of rights or remedies; (vi) provisions authorizing or validating conclusive or discretionary determinations; (vii) grants of setoff rights; (viii) provisions to the effect that a guarantor is liable as a primary obligor, and not as a surety, and provisions purporting to waive modifications of any guaranty obligation to the extent such modification constitutes a novation; (ix) provisions for the payment of attorneys  fees where such payment is contrary to law or public policy and we call to your attention the provisions of Sections 1717 and 1717.5 of the California Civil Code, which limit and create obligations for the payment of attorneys  fees; (x) proxies, powers and trusts; (xi) provisions prohibiting, restricting, or requiring consent to assignment or transfer of any right or property; (xii) provisions for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties, make-whole premiums or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty; (xiii) provisions permitting, upon   

acceleration of any indebtedness, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon; and (xiv) the severability, if invalid, of provisions to the foregoing effect  ;   

(e)  the effect of California law, which provides that a court may refuse to enforce, or may limit the application of, a contract or any clause thereof which the court finds as a matter of law to have been unconscionable at the time it was made or contrary to public policy; 

(f)  we have assumed that the directors of the Company have each complied with all applicable fiduciary duties, including without limitation, the duties of care and loyalty, in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby; 

(g)  our opinions as to any Transaction Agreement do not extend to any agreement, document, exhibit, attachment or form referred to, or incorporated by reference by, such Transaction Agreement (other than the other Transaction Agreements); and 

(h)  we express no opinion as to any provision of the Transaction Agreements concerning the voting of the Company s capital stock. 

We have assumed that the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the issuance and sale of the Units, are not void or voidable within the meaning of Section 144 of the DGCL by reason of subsection (a)(1), (2) or (3) thereof.  

With respect to our opinion as to the enforceability of the Transaction Agreements, we call your attention to the fact that such agreements choose as governing law the internal laws of the State of California, but pertain to certain matters of governance of a Delaware corporation. As noted above, this letter is limited to the effect of the internal laws of the State of California and with respect to paragraphs 1, 2, 4(b), 4(c) and 5(a) of this letter, the DGCL, and, with your consent, we express no opinion as to the enforceability of such agreements to the extent that they may be deemed to conflict with any Delaware law other than the DGCL. 

In rendering the opinion expressed in paragraph 6 above, we have assumed that the Company is not disqualified from relying on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 506 thereunder by reason of the provisions of paragraphs (d) or (e) of said Rule 506 (relating to so-called  bad actors ). 

We express no opinion or confirmation as to federal or state securities laws (except as expressly set forth in paragraph 6), tax laws, antitrust or trade regulation laws, insolvency or fraudulent transfer laws, antifraud laws, compliance with fiduciary duty requirements, pension or employee benefit laws, usury laws or environmental laws (without limiting other laws excluded by customary practice). 

With your consent, we have assumed (a) that the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitute legally valid and binding obligations of, the parties thereto other than the Company, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, and (b) that the status of the Transaction Agreements as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or   

instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities, provided that we make no such assumption to the extent we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company herein.  

This letter is furnished only to you and is solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions referenced in the first paragraph. This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to or relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity for any purpose, without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in our sole discretion.

Exhibit 99.1 

Attributed Financial Information for Our Platform Common Stock and Tracking Stocks 

Our tracking stocks are intended to reflect the separate performance of one or more of our brand contracts. Our platform common stock is intended to reflect the separate performance of all of our assets and liabilities not attributed to our existing tracking stocks or any other tracking stock that we may create from time to time. 

The following tables present our assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows that are attributed to our platform common stock and our tracking stocks for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The financial information should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Notwithstanding the following attribution of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows to our platform common stock and our tracking stocks, our tracking stock structure does not affect the ownership or the respective legal title to our assets or responsibility for our liabilities. Holders of our platform common stock and our tracking stocks are holders of our common stock and are subject to risks associated with an investment in our company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. The issuance of our platform common stock or tracking stocks does not affect the rights of our creditors.

NOTES TO ATTRIBUTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

(Unaudited) 

We have attributed the following assets and liabilities to the tracking stocks: 

95% of our acquired brand income ( ABI ), that we acquire under our brand contracts except for the Fantex Professional Sports Tracking Stock where 100% of our ABI is attributed to the tracking stock.     

any and all of our liabilities, costs and expenses incurred after the offering of each of our tracking stocks that are directly attributable to the brand associated with the tracking stock, such as our direct costs arising out of our promotion of the brand or arising out of or related to the maintenance and enforcement of the brand contract, provided, however, that to date we have not attributed any of the expenses or costs related to the initial public offerings of our tracking stocks (other than underwriting commissions and expenses) or incurred by us or our parent prior to the consummation of the offerings, including our efforts to build our business model and enter into our brand contracts, to any of our tracking stocks;     

a pro rata share of our general liabilities, costs and expenses not directly attributable to any specific tracking stock (calculated based on attributable ABI), but excluding any non-cash expenses that are allocated from our parent to us. Attributable expenses would include, for example, a pro rata portion of the service fee we pay to our parent pursuant to the management agreement (5% of the attributed ABI from our brand contracts). Expenses that would not be attributed would include expenses incurred by our parent, including any expenses incurred in providing services to us under the management agreement, to the extent in excess of our service fee to them;     

as income, any covered amounts, as described below, for our brand contracts; and     

as an expense, the pro rata share of any covered amounts, as described below, relating to any tracking stock brand.     

We will also attribute the following additional assets and liabilities to each tracking stock brand: 

all net income or net losses from the assets and liabilities that are included in each tracking stock brand and all net proceeds from any disposition of any such assets, in each case, after deductions to reflect any dividends paid to holders of shares of a specific tracking stock; and     

any acquisitions or investments made from assets that are included in a specific tracking stock brand.     

Covered Amounts 

As described above, income (and assets) and liabilities will generally be attributed to a tracking stock based on the income and liabilities of that tracking stock. However, if as a result of any debtor relief laws we do not receive any portion of our ABI from a brand contract then we will nonetheless attribute income during any period to the corresponding tracking stock in an amount equal to the difference between any amounts we actually receive under that brand contract and the amounts to which we would otherwise have been entitled to receive but for debtor relief laws. We refer to such difference as a covered amount. 

In such a case, the covered amount will also be attributed as a general expense of Fantex, and we will attribute the pro rata share of any covered amounts to each tracking stock as an expense, as discussed above. 

Platform Stock 

Our platform stock has attributed to it all of our assets and liabilities that are not specifically attributed to our current tracking stocks or to any other tracking stocks that we may establish from time to time. The assets  

attributed to the platform stock will thus include, for example, any portion of the ABI for any brand contract that is not specifically attributed to the associated tracking stock. For example, we will attribute the 5% of our ABI under our existing brand contracts to the platform stock except for our Fantex Series Professional Sports tracking stock where do not attribute any of our ABI.  

As of September 30, 2016, Investment in Brand Contracts, at Fair Value in the Attributed Balance Sheet Information for our Platform Common Stock includes: 

(1)   Per our attribution policy, 5% of the brand contract value is attributed to the Platform Common Stock  . 

We believe the attribution presented in the financial information above reasonably reflects our attribution policy to track the performance of our tracking stocks. We cannot guarantee that any tracking stock will in fact track the performance of the associated brand contract. 

Management Discussion of Tracking Stocks 

Our valuation process relies significantly on the full year on-field statistical performance of the athlete as inputs into the valuation model. From that data, we generate a list of comparable players who we believe are of similar caliber to the athlete   and who have entered into contracts in a similar era, and are or were at similar ages and stages in their career.   The results of this process can be volatile in any given period and result in large changes in fair value of the brand contract, if the on-field statistical performance varies from our previous estimates. 

The largest attributed asset for each of our tracking stocks is the brand contract associated with each tracking stock. We expect the underlying brand contract to be the largest single attributed asset for each tracking stock for the foreseeable future. As the cash generated by each brand contract is remitted to us, we intend to return a portion of this cash to the stockholders of the tracking stock in the form of dividend payments. The remaining cash will be used to meet the working capital and attributed operating needs of the tracking stock and for potential future co-investment opportunities that may arise pursuant to the brand contract. 

Fantex Series Vernon Davis    

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Vernon Davis on April 28, 2014 raising approximately $4.21 million from the sale of 421,100 shares. On May 2, 2014, we paid Vernon Davis $4.00 million to complete our purchase of the Vernon Davis brand contract.  

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $72,147 and $219,971 respectively of ABI to Fantex Series Vernon Davis Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Vernon Davis ). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $61,812 from Vernon Davis s NFL player contract and $10,362 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $182,029 from Vernon Davis s NFL player contract and $37,943 from his endorsement   

contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $7,894 and $24,037 respectively to Fantex Series Vernon Davis.  

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Vernon Davis brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Vernon Davis brand contract generated attributed income of $23,519 and an attributed loss of $58,689, respectively.     

On March 31, 2016, Vernon Davis signed a new, one-year NFL player contract with the Washington Redskins. The effect of this new contract was to decrease the fair value of the Vernon Davis brand contract by approximately $0.1 million. This decrease in the net present value (the  NPV ) of expected cash flows from this brand contract was partially offset by the passage of time which brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.   As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.      

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Vernon Davis as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Vernon Davis s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are: 

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Vernon Davis would have an NFL career length of at least 12 years, through the 2017 NFL season;       

that he will enter into an additional one-year NFL player contract for at least $2.6 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are significantly in excess of compensation that he has had historically from these sources; and     

Vernon Davis has completed his tenth NFL regular season. On March 31, 2016 as a free agent, Vernon Davis signed a one-year NFL player contract with the Washington Redskins for the 2016 NFL season. Based on our valuation of Vernon Davis  brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of 12 years. We estimate Vernon Davis will sign an additional one-year, $2.6 million NFL player contract prior to the 2017 NFL season.   In determining that Vernon Davis would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are generally consistent with the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Vernon Davis can demonstrate success as a tight end in the NFL, and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize consistent levels of endorsement income.  

The following table shows the change in fair value of the Vernon Davis brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A )    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of October 30, 2013 through September 30, 2016.

In accordance with Management and Attribution Policies, 95% is attributed to Fantex Series Vernon Davis and 5% to our platform common stock.     

Other Items 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we exercised our co-investment right under the terms of the brand contract with Vernon Davis in connection with Vernon Davis  purchase of Jamba Juice franchises. Vernon Davis was offered this opportunity in connection with an expanded endorsement relationship. We paid $110,800 for a 10% ownership interest in the franchises and per our attribution policy, will attribute 95% of the cash flows from this investment to Fantex Series Vernon Davis. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not collect any amounts from this investment.  

Fantex Series EJ Manuel  

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series EJ Manuel on July 21, 2014 raising approximately $5.24 million from the sale of 523,700 shares. On July 25, 2014, we paid EJ Manuel $4.975 million to complete our purchase of the EJ Manuel brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $27,963 and $39,763 respectively of ABI to   Fantex Series EJ Manuel Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series EJ Manuel )  . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $27,102 from EJ Manuel s NFL player contract and $861 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $35,731 from EJ Manuel s NFL player contract and $4,032 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $97 and $4,884 respectively to   Fantex Series EJ Manuel.   There were no significant changes with respect to EJ Manuel s existing brand income contracts and no new material brand income contracts were signed during the quarter. 		 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the EJ Manuel brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the EJ Manuel brand contract generated attributed income of $24,216 and $81,594, respectively.  

The increase in the fair value of the EJ Manuel brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from this brand contract. The NPV of estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. 

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for EJ Manuel as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for EJ Manuel s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that EJ Manuel would have an NFL career length of at least seven years, through the 2019 NFL season; and     

that during this time he would play out his existing NFL player contract and will enter into two additional NFL player contracts for at least $10.5 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources.     

EJ Manuel has completed his third NFL regular season and has a current NFL player contract with the Buffalo Bills that expires following his fourth season in the NFL. Based on our valuation of EJ Manuel s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of seven years. We estimate EJ Manuel will sign a two-year, $7.4 million NFL player contract beginning with the 2017 NFL season and a one-year, $3.1 million NFL player contract prior to the 2019 NFL season. We believe that EJ Manuel will enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources. 

The following table shows the change in fair value of the EJ Manuel brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in MD A    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of February 14, 2014 through September 30, 2016  .

Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu  

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu on November 3, 2014 raising approximately $1.64 million from the sale of 164,300 shares. On November 3, 2014, we paid Mohamed Sanu $1.56 million to complete our purchase of the Mohamed Sanu brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $16,861 and $512,310 respectively of ABI to   Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu )  . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $ 16,765 from Mohamed Sanu s NFL player contract and $96 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $510,314 from Mohamed Sanu s NFL player contract and $1,996 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $0 and $56,192 respectively to   Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu.    

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Mohamed Sanu brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Mohamed Sanu brand contract generated attributed income of $37,671 and $509,506, respectively.  

On March 10, 2016, as a free agent, Mohamed Sanu signed a new, five-year NFL player contract with the Atlanta Falcons.   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, t  he decrease in fair value of Mohamed Sanu's brand contract from the new player contract was approximately $0.1 million after recording the effects of the receivable and gain from the ABI associated with the $5.0 million portion of the $7.0 million signing bonus. This decrease in the NPV of expected cash flows from this brand contract was partially offset by the passage of time which brought these future cash flows closer to the present.   As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.        		 

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Mohamed Sanu as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Mohamed Sanu s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Mohamed Sanu would have an NFL career length of at least eight years, through the 2019 NFL season.     

Mohamed Sanu has completed his fourth NFL regular season. He has played his entire career with the Cincinnati Bengals. On March 10, 2016 as a free agent, Mohamed Sanu signed a five-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons. Based on our valuation of Mohamed Sanu s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of eight years. In determining that Mohamed Sanu would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Mohamed Sanu can demonstrate consistent success as a wide receiver in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income. However, Mohamed Sanu currently has no endorsement arrangements that   are individually or in the aggregate significant to estimated current or future ABI.    		 

The following table shows the change in fair value of the Mohamed Sanu brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in MD A    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of May 14, 2014 through September 30, 2016  .

Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery      

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery on March 19, 2015 raising approximately $8.36 million from the sale of 835,800 shares. On March 19, 2015, we paid Alshon Jeffery $7.94 million to complete our purchase of the Alshon Jeffery brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $328,234 and $349,225, respectively of ABI to Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery ). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, this was comprised of $ 318,172 from Alshon Jeffery s NFL  player contract and $10,061 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this was comprised of $329,996 from Alshon Jeffery s NFL  player contract and $19,229 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $356 and $14,379, respectively to Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery  . 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Alshon Jeffery brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements   in this Form 10-Q  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Alshon Jeffery brand contract generated attributed income of $284,787 and $1,600,291, respectively.    Alshon Jeffery was unable to negotiate a long-term contract for the 2016 NFL season and is playing under the franchise tag for a guaranteed $14,599,000.  This was a change in the cash flow amounts, cash flow timing and discount rates assumptions from the prior quarter and as such, this increased fair value of his brand contract by $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.           		 

The remaining increase in the fair value of the Alshon Jeffery brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from the brand contract. The NPV of estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.  

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Alshon Jeffery as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value:  

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Alshon Jeffery brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are: 

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Alshon Jeffery would have an NFL career length of at least 12 years through the 2023 NFL season; and;      

that he will enter into additional multi-year NFL player contracts for at least $91.3 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are significantly in excess of compensation that he has had historically from these sources.     

Alshon Jeffery has completed his fourth NFL regular season and his existing NFL player contract with the Chicago Bears expired on February 29, 2016.   On February 26, 2016, the Chicago Bears placed a non-exclusive franchise player tag on Alshon Jeffery which prevents him from becoming an unrestricted free agent for the 2016 NFL season and will pay him a guaranteed salary for the 2016 NFL season of $14.6 million.   Based on our valuation of Alshon Jeffery s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of 12 years. We estimate Alshon Jeffery will sign a five-year, $72.8 million NFL player contract prior to the 2017 NFL season and a two-year, $18.6 million NFL player contract prior to the 2022 NFL season.     In determining that Alshon Jeffery would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Alshon Jeffery can demonstrate consistent success as a wide receiver in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income.  		 

The following table shows the change in fair value of the Alshon Jeffery brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in MD A    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of September 7, 2014 through September 30, 2016  .

Other Events 

On November 14, 2016 it was announced that Alshon Jeffery has been suspended for four games without pay for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing substances. Pursuant to our brand contract with Alshon Jeffery, he is contractually obligated to pay us the ABI for those four games after they are played. 

Fantex Series Michael Brockers 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Michael Brockers on May 29, 2015 raising approximately $3.62 million from the sale of 362,200 shares. On June 2, 2015, we paid Michael Brockers $3.44 million to complete our purchase of the Michael Brockers brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $351,296 and $367,173 of ABI to Fantex Series Michael Brockers Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Michael Brockers ). During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $349,734 was from Michael Brockers  NFL player contract and 1,562 from his endorsement contracts.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $365,611 was from Michael Brockers  NFL contract and $1,562 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $0 and $3,851, respectively to Fantex Series Michael Brockers.   During the quarter Michael Brockers signed a three-year extension with the Los Angeles Rams as described below.  No other material brand income contracts were signed during the quarter.  		 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Michael Brockers brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Michael Brockers brand contract generated attributed income of $650,135 and $863,263, respectively.  

In September, 2016, Michael Brockers signed a three year extension with the Los Angeles Rams for approximately $33.3 million. This is in addition to his current $6.1 million salary paid in the 2016 NFL season and extends his term with the Rams through the 2019 NFL season. The addition of new contract cash flows and the change in discount rates on those cash flows increased the fair value of this contract approximately $ 0.3 million during the period. The remaining increase in the fair value of the Michael Brockers brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from the brand contract. The     NPV     of     estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter     period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV     (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this     would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. 		 

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above, of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Michael Brockers as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Michael Brockers s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Michael Brockers would have an NFL career length of at least ten years through the 2021 NFL season; and     

that Michael Brockers will play under his current contract extension through the NFL 2019 season and he will enter into an additional multi-year NFL player contract for approximately $12.7 million prior to the 2020 NFL season and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are significantly in excess of compensation that he has had historically from these sources.     

Michael Brockers completed the NFL regular season of the final year of a four-year player contract signed with the St. Louis Rams, however, the Rams exercised their Fifth-Year Team Option for the 2016 NFL season. In September, 2016, Michael Brockers signed a three-year extension for approximately $33.3 million. This is in addition to his current $6.1 million salary paid in the 2016 NFL season and extends his term with the Rams through the 2019 NFL season. The addition of new contract cash flows and the change in discount rates on those cash flows increased the fair value of this contract approximately $ 0.3 million during the period.  

We estimated that Michael Brockers would enter into a second NFL player contract prior to the 2020 season, his ninth NFL season. Based on our valuation of   Michael Brockers    brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that   he   will have a career length of ten years. In determining that Michael Brockers would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Michael Brockers can demonstrate consistent success as a defensive tackle in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income. However, Michael Brockers currently has no endorsement arrangements that   are individually or in the aggregate significant to estimated current or future ABI.

There were no significant changes with respect to Jack Mewhort s existing brand income contracts and no new material brand income contracts were signed during the quarter.      		 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Jack Mewhort brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Jack Mewhort brand contract generated attributed income of $116,149 and $353,066.

that Jack Mewhort would have an NFL career length of at least ten years through the 2023 NFL season; and

Jack Mewhort has completed his second NFL regular season and has a current NFL player contract with the Indianapolis Colts that expires following his fourth season in the NFL. Based on our valuation of Jack Mewhort s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of ten years. We estimate Jack Mewhort will sign a six-year, $56.6 million NFL player contract prior to the 2018 NFL season. In determining that Jack Mewhort would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Jack Mewhort can demonstrate consistent success as an offensive lineman in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income.

We have attributed the following assets and liabilities to the tracking stocks: 

95% of our acquired brand income ( ABI ), that we acquire under our brand contracts except for the Fantex Professional Sports Tracking Stock where 100% of our ABI is attributed to the tracking stock.     

any and all of our liabilities, costs and expenses incurred after the offering of each of our tracking stocks that are directly attributable to the brand associated with the tracking stock, such as our direct costs arising out of our promotion of the brand or arising out of or related to the maintenance and enforcement of the brand contract, provided, however, that to date we have not attributed any of the expenses or costs related to the initial public offerings of our tracking stocks (other than underwriting commissions and expenses) or incurred by us or our parent prior to the consummation of the offerings, including our efforts to build our business model and enter into our brand contracts, to any of our tracking stocks;     

a pro rata share of our general liabilities, costs and expenses not directly attributable to any specific tracking stock (calculated based on attributable ABI), but excluding any non-cash expenses that are allocated from our parent to us. Attributable expenses would include, for example, a pro rata portion of the service fee we pay to our parent pursuant to the management agreement (5% of the attributed ABI from our brand contracts). Expenses that would not be attributed would include expenses incurred by our parent, including any expenses incurred in providing services to us under the management agreement, to the extent in excess of our service fee to them;     

as income, any covered amounts, as described below, for our brand contracts; and

We will also attribute the following additional assets and liabilities to each tracking stock brand: 

all net income or net losses from the assets and liabilities that are included in each tracking stock brand and all net proceeds from any disposition of any such assets, in each case, after deductions to reflect any dividends paid to holders of shares of a specific tracking stock; and     

any acquisitions or investments made from assets that are included in a specific tracking stock brand.     

Covered Amounts 

As described above, income (and assets) and liabilities will generally be attributed to a tracking stock based on the income and liabilities of that tracking stock. However, if as a result of any debtor relief laws we do not receive any portion of our ABI from a brand contract then we will nonetheless attribute income during any period to the corresponding tracking stock in an amount equal to the difference between any amounts we actually receive under that brand contract and the amounts to which we would otherwise have been entitled to receive but for debtor relief laws. We refer to such difference as a covered amount. 

In such a case, the covered amount will also be attributed as a general expense of Fantex, and we will attribute the pro rata share of any covered amounts to each tracking stock as an expense, as discussed above. 

Platform Stock 

Our platform stock has attributed to it all of our assets and liabilities that are not specifically attributed to our current tracking stocks or to any other tracking stocks that we may establish from time to time. The assets  

attributed to the platform stock will thus include, for example, any portion of the ABI for any brand contract that is not specifically attributed to the associated tracking stock. For example, we will attribute the 5% of our ABI under our existing brand contracts to the platform stock except for our Fantex Series Professional Sports tracking stock where do not attribute any of our ABI.  

As of September 30, 2016, Investment in Brand Contracts, at Fair Value in the Attributed Balance Sheet Information for our Platform Common Stock includes: 

(1)   Per our attribution policy, 5% of the brand contract value is attributed to the Platform Common Stock  . 

We believe the attribution presented in the financial information above reasonably reflects our attribution policy to track the performance of our tracking stocks. We cannot guarantee that any tracking stock will in fact track the performance of the associated brand contract. 

Management Discussion of Tracking Stocks 

Our valuation process relies significantly on the full year on-field statistical performance of the athlete as inputs into the valuation model. From that data, we generate a list of comparable players who we believe are of similar caliber to the athlete   and who have entered into contracts in a similar era, and are or were at similar ages and stages in their career.   The results of this process can be volatile in any given period and result in large changes in fair value of the brand contract, if the on-field statistical performance varies from our previous estimates. 

The largest attributed asset for each of our tracking stocks is the brand contract associated with each tracking stock. We expect the underlying brand contract to be the largest single attributed asset for each tracking stock for the foreseeable future. As the cash generated by each brand contract is remitted to us, we intend to return a portion of this cash to the stockholders of the tracking stock in the form of dividend payments. The remaining cash will be used to meet the working capital and attributed operating needs of the tracking stock and for potential future co-investment opportunities that may arise pursuant to the brand contract. 

Fantex Series Vernon Davis    

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Vernon Davis on April 28, 2014 raising approximately $4.21 million from the sale of 421,100 shares. On May 2, 2014, we paid Vernon Davis $4.00 million to complete our purchase of the Vernon Davis brand contract.  

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $72,147 and $219,971 respectively of ABI to Fantex Series Vernon Davis Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Vernon Davis ). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $61,812 from Vernon Davis s NFL player contract and $10,362 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $182,029 from Vernon Davis s NFL player contract and $37,943 from his endorsement   

contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $7,894 and $24,037 respectively to Fantex Series Vernon Davis.  

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Vernon Davis brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Vernon Davis brand contract generated attributed income of $23,519 and an attributed loss of $58,689, respectively.     

On March 31, 2016, Vernon Davis signed a new, one-year NFL player contract with the Washington Redskins. The effect of this new contract was to decrease the fair value of the Vernon Davis brand contract by approximately $0.1 million. This decrease in the net present value (the  NPV ) of expected cash flows from this brand contract was partially offset by the passage of time which brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.   As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.      

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Vernon Davis as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Vernon Davis s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are: 

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Vernon Davis would have an NFL career length of at least 12 years, through the 2017 NFL season;       

that he will enter into an additional one-year NFL player contract for at least $2.6 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are significantly in excess of compensation that he has had historically from these sources; and     

Vernon Davis has completed his tenth NFL regular season. On March 31, 2016 as a free agent, Vernon Davis signed a one-year NFL player contract with the Washington Redskins for the 2016 NFL season. Based on our valuation of Vernon Davis  brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of 12 years. We estimate Vernon Davis will sign an additional one-year, $2.6 million NFL player contract prior to the 2017 NFL season.   In determining that Vernon Davis would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are generally consistent with the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Vernon Davis can demonstrate success as a tight end in the NFL, and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize consistent levels of endorsement income.  

The following table shows the change in fair value of the Vernon Davis brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A )    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of October 30, 2013 through September 30, 2016.

Other Items 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we exercised our co-investment right under the terms of the brand contract with Vernon Davis in connection with Vernon Davis  purchase of Jamba Juice franchises. Vernon Davis was offered this opportunity in connection with an expanded endorsement relationship. We paid $110,800 for a 10% ownership interest in the franchises and per our attribution policy, will attribute 95% of the cash flows from this investment to Fantex Series Vernon Davis. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not collect any amounts from this investment.  

Fantex Series EJ Manuel  

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series EJ Manuel on July 21, 2014 raising approximately $5.24 million from the sale of 523,700 shares. On July 25, 2014, we paid EJ Manuel $4.975 million to complete our purchase of the EJ Manuel brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $27,963 and $39,763 respectively of ABI to   Fantex Series EJ Manuel Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series EJ Manuel )  . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $27,102 from EJ Manuel s NFL player contract and $861 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $35,731 from EJ Manuel s NFL player contract and $4,032 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $97 and $4,884 respectively to   Fantex Series EJ Manuel.   There were no significant changes with respect to EJ Manuel s existing brand income contracts and no new material brand income contracts were signed during the quarter. 		 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the EJ Manuel brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the EJ Manuel brand contract generated attributed income of $24,216 and $81,594, respectively.  

The increase in the fair value of the EJ Manuel brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from this brand contract. The NPV of estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. 

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for EJ Manuel as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for EJ Manuel s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that EJ Manuel would have an NFL career length of at least seven years, through the 2019 NFL season; and     

that during this time he would play out his existing NFL player contract and will enter into two additional NFL player contracts for at least $10.5 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources.     

EJ Manuel has completed his third NFL regular season and has a current NFL player contract with the Buffalo Bills that expires following his fourth season in the NFL. Based on our valuation of EJ Manuel s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of seven years. We estimate EJ Manuel will sign a two-year, $7.4 million NFL player contract beginning with the 2017 NFL season and a one-year, $3.1 million NFL player contract prior to the 2019 NFL season. We believe that EJ Manuel will enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources. 

The following table shows the change in fair value of the EJ Manuel brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in MD A    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of February 14, 2014 through September 30, 2016  .

Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu  

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu on November 3, 2014 raising approximately $1.64 million from the sale of 164,300 shares. On November 3, 2014, we paid Mohamed Sanu $1.56 million to complete our purchase of the Mohamed Sanu brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $16,861 and $512,310 respectively of ABI to   Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu )  . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $ 16,765 from Mohamed Sanu s NFL player contract and $96 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the attributed ABI was comprised of $510,314 from Mohamed Sanu s NFL player contract and $1,996 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $0 and $56,192 respectively to   Fantex Series Mohamed Sanu.    

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Mohamed Sanu brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Mohamed Sanu brand contract generated attributed income of $37,671 and $509,506, respectively.  

On March 10, 2016, as a free agent, Mohamed Sanu signed a new, five-year NFL player contract with the Atlanta Falcons.   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, t  he decrease in fair value of Mohamed Sanu's brand contract from the new player contract was approximately $0.1 million after recording the effects of the receivable and gain from the ABI associated with the $5.0 million portion of the $7.0 million signing bonus. This decrease in the NPV of expected cash flows from this brand contract was partially offset by the passage of time which brought these future cash flows closer to the present.   As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.        		 

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Mohamed Sanu as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Mohamed Sanu s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Mohamed Sanu would have an NFL career length of at least eight years, through the 2019 NFL season.     

Mohamed Sanu has completed his fourth NFL regular season. He has played his entire career with the Cincinnati Bengals. On March 10, 2016 as a free agent, Mohamed Sanu signed a five-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons. Based on our valuation of Mohamed Sanu s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of eight years. In determining that Mohamed Sanu would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Mohamed Sanu can demonstrate consistent success as a wide receiver in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income. However, Mohamed Sanu currently has no endorsement arrangements that   are individually or in the aggregate significant to estimated current or future ABI.    		 

The following table shows the change in fair value of the Mohamed Sanu brand contract by Category A, Category B, and Category C,   based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described in MD A    Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  located in this Form 10-Q   from the brand contract inception date of May 14, 2014 through September 30, 2016  .

Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery      

Initial Public Offering 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery on March 19, 2015 raising approximately $8.36 million from the sale of 835,800 shares. On March 19, 2015, we paid Alshon Jeffery $7.94 million to complete our purchase of the Alshon Jeffery brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $328,234 and $349,225, respectively of ABI to Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery ). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, this was comprised of $ 318,172 from Alshon Jeffery s NFL  player contract and $10,061 from his endorsement contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this was comprised of $329,996 from Alshon Jeffery s NFL  player contract and $19,229 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $356 and $14,379, respectively to Fantex Series Alshon Jeffery  . 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Alshon Jeffery brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements   in this Form 10-Q  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Alshon Jeffery brand contract generated attributed income of $284,787 and $1,600,291, respectively.    Alshon Jeffery was unable to negotiate a long-term contract for the 2016 NFL season and is playing under the franchise tag for a guaranteed $14,599,000.  This was a change in the cash flow amounts, cash flow timing and discount rates assumptions from the prior quarter and as such, this increased fair value of his brand contract by $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.           		 

The remaining increase in the fair value of the Alshon Jeffery brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from the brand contract. The NPV of estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.  

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Alshon Jeffery as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value:  

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Alshon Jeffery brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are: 

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Alshon Jeffery would have an NFL career length of at least 12 years through the 2023 NFL season; and;      

that he will enter into additional multi-year NFL player contracts for at least $91.3 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are significantly in excess of compensation that he has had historically from these sources.     

Alshon Jeffery has completed his fourth NFL regular season and his existing NFL player contract with the Chicago Bears expired on February 29, 2016.   On February 26, 2016, the Chicago Bears placed a non-exclusive franchise player tag on Alshon Jeffery which prevents him from becoming an unrestricted free agent for the 2016 NFL season and will pay him a guaranteed salary for the 2016 NFL season of $14.6 million.   Based on our valuation of Alshon Jeffery s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of 12 years. We estimate Alshon Jeffery will sign a five-year, $72.8 million NFL player contract prior to the 2017 NFL season and a two-year, $18.6 million NFL player contract prior to the 2022 NFL season.     In determining that Alshon Jeffery would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Alshon Jeffery can demonstrate consistent success as a wide receiver in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income.

Other Events 

On November 14, 2016 it was announced that Alshon Jeffery has been suspended for four games without pay for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing substances. Pursuant to our brand contract with Alshon Jeffery, he is contractually obligated to pay us the ABI for those four games after they are played. 

Fantex Series Michael Brockers 

We completed the initial public offering of the Fantex Series Michael Brockers on May 29, 2015 raising approximately $3.62 million from the sale of 362,200 shares. On June 2, 2015, we paid Michael Brockers $3.44 million to complete our purchase of the Michael Brockers brand contract. 

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $351,296 and $367,173 of ABI to Fantex Series Michael Brockers Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Michael Brockers ). During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $349,734 was from Michael Brockers  NFL player contract and 1,562 from his endorsement contracts.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $365,611 was from Michael Brockers  NFL contract and $1,562 from his endorsement contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $0 and $3,851, respectively to Fantex Series Michael Brockers.   During the quarter Michael Brockers signed a three-year extension with the Los Angeles Rams as described below.  No other material brand income contracts were signed during the quarter.  		 

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Michael Brockers brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Michael Brockers brand contract generated attributed income of $650,135 and $863,263, respectively.  

In September, 2016, Michael Brockers signed a three year extension with the Los Angeles Rams for approximately $33.3 million. This is in addition to his current $6.1 million salary paid in the 2016 NFL season and extends his term with the Rams through the 2019 NFL season. The addition of new contract cash flows and the change in discount rates on those cash flows increased the fair value of this contract approximately $ 0.3 million during the period. The remaining increase in the fair value of the Michael Brockers brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from the brand contract. The     NPV     of     estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter     period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV     (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this     would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. 		 

The following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above, of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Michael Brockers as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Michael Brockers s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Michael Brockers would have an NFL career length of at least ten years through the 2021 NFL season; and     

that Michael Brockers will play under his current contract extension through the NFL 2019 season and he will enter into an additional multi-year NFL player contract for approximately $12.7 million prior to the 2020 NFL season and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that are significantly in excess of compensation that he has had historically from these sources.     

Michael Brockers completed the NFL regular season of the final year of a four-year player contract signed with the St. Louis Rams, however, the Rams exercised their Fifth-Year Team Option for the 2016 NFL season. In September, 2016, Michael Brockers signed a three-year extension for approximately $33.3 million. This is in addition to his current $6.1 million salary paid in the 2016 NFL season and extends his term with the Rams through the 2019 NFL season. The addition of new contract cash flows and the change in discount rates on those cash flows increased the fair value of this contract approximately $ 0.3 million during the period.  

We estimated that Michael Brockers would enter into a second NFL player contract prior to the 2020 season, his ninth NFL season. Based on our valuation of   Michael Brockers    brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that   he   will have a career length of ten years. In determining that Michael Brockers would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Michael Brockers can demonstrate consistent success as a defensive tackle in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income. However, Michael Brockers currently has no endorsement arrangements that   are individually or in the aggregate significant to estimated current or future ABI.

Attributed Acquired Brand Income and Expenses 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed $12,488 and $35,155, respectively of ABI to Fantex Series Jack Mewhort Convertible Tracking Stock (the  Fantex Series Jack Mewhort ). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, this was comprised of $12,488 from Jack Mewhort s NFL player contract and $0 from his endorsement contracts.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we attributed expenses for management fees and direct costs of $  0 and $3,348 to Fantex Series Jack Mewhort.

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the Jack Mewhort brand contract at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Jack Mewhort brand contract generated attributed income of $116,149 and $353,066.  

The increase in the fair value of the Jack Mewhort brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from the brand contract. The NPV of estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. 

T  he following table shows our estimates as of September 30, 2016, based on the quantitative and qualitative factors described above, of Category A, Category B and Category C brand income for Jack Mewhort as a percentage of our estimate of aggregate lifetime brand income, on a gross basis before we applied any discount rates, and on a net basis after we applied our discount rates, as well as the discount rates that we applied to each of these categories in our estimate of brand value: 

The most significant assumptions in our determination of fair value for Jack Mewhort s brand contract as of September 30, 2016 are:   

discount rates for each of Category A, Category B and Category C as set forth above;     

that Jack Mewhort would have an NFL career length of at least ten years through the 2023 NFL season; and     

that during this time he would play out his existing NFL player contract and will enter into an additional six-year NFL player contract for at least $56.6 million in total and that he will be able over the same period and beyond to enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources  .     

Jack Mewhort has completed his second NFL regular season and has a current NFL player contract with the Indianapolis Colts that expires following his fourth season in the NFL. Based on our valuation of Jack Mewhort s brand contract using the statistical data through the 2015 NFL season, we estimate that he will have a career length of ten years. We estimate Jack Mewhort will sign a six-year, $56.6 million NFL player contract prior to the 2018 NFL season. In determining that Jack Mewhort would enter into and maintain endorsement contracts (or earn other brand income) that compensate him in amounts that exceed the compensation that he has had historically from these sources, we believe Jack Mewhort can demonstrate consistent success as an offensive lineman in the NFL and, therefore, we believe he is a good candidate to realize a higher level of endorsement income. However, Jack Mewhort currently has no endorsement arrangements that   are individually or in the aggregate significant to estimated current or future ABI  .

Estimated Fair Value and Change in Fair Value of Brand Contract 

We account for the included brand contracts at estimated fair market value, as more fully described in the   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q  .    For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the included brand contract generated attributed income of $5,753,942.  

The increase in the fair value of the included brand contract was driven primarily by an increase in the NPV of expected cash flows from the brand contract. The NPV of estimated future cash receipts increased due mainly to the passage of time and not as a result of any significant changes in our estimates in the amount or timing of cash to be received under this brand contract. The passage of time brought these future cash flows closer to the present. As these future cash flows are closer to the present they are subject to a shorter period of time for discounting which results in an increase in the present value of these cash flows. As long as other items affecting NPV (e.g. timing of cash receipts, discount rates, etc.) do not change significantly, this would result in an increase in the present value of these cash flows.
