 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and notes of Devon have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in Devon s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements furnished in this report reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of Devon s results of operations and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and Devon s financial position as of September 30, 2016. 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 In January 2016, Devon adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Topic 835): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This ASU requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an asset. As a result of the adoption, Devon reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of $81 million as of December 31, 2015 from other long-term assets to a reduction of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 The FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  Its objective is to clarify guidance and eliminate diversity in practice of classification on certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Devon early adopted this ASU as of September 30, 2016 using a retrospective transition method. As a result of the adoption, Devon has classified $82 million of debt retirement payments as cash flows from financing activities on the accompanying 2016 consolidated statements of cash flows. No other periods presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows were impacted by the adoption of this standard.    
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 The FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Its objective is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including accounting for income taxes when awards vest or are settled, statutory withholding and accounting for forfeitures. Classification of these aspects on the statement of cash flows is also addressed. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2017. Devon does not expect that this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 The FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605,  Extractive Activities   Oil and Gas   Revenue Recognition.  This ASU provides guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Its objective is to increase the usefulness of information in the financial statements regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was delayed through the issuance of ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date,  to annual and interim periods beginning in 2018, with early adoption permitted in 2017. The ASU is required to be adopted using either the retrospective transition method, which requires restating previously reported results or the cumulative effect (modified retrospective) transition method, which utilizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption to account for prior period effects rather than restating previously reported results. Devon intends to use the cumulative effect transition method and is continuing to evaluate the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Devon does not plan on early adopting.

    The FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU will supersede the lease requirements in Topic 840,   Leases  . Its objective is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. This ASU provides guidance   requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet. Lessor accounting does not significantly change from Topic 840, except for some changes made to align with Topic 606. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2019 and will be a  pplied using a modified retrospective transition method, which requires applying the new guidance to leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. Devon is continu  ing to evaluate the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not plan on early adopting.

 Acquisitions and Divestitures    

 Devon Acquisitions 
 On January 7, 2016, Devon acquired approximately 80,000 net acres and assets in the STACK play for approximately $1.5 billion. Devon funded the acquisition with $849 million of cash and $659 million of common equity shares. The allocation of the purchase price at September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.3 billion to unproved properties and approximately $200 million to proved properties. 

EnLink Acquisitions 
 On January 7, 2016, EnLink acquired Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets, along with dedicated acreage service rights and service contracts, for approximately $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. EnLink funded the acquisition with approximately $215 million of General Partner common units and approximately $800 million of cash, primarily funded with the issuance of EnLink preferred units. The remaining $500 million of the purchase price is to be paid within one year with the option to defer $250 million of the final payment 24 months from the close date. The first $250 million of undiscounted future installment payment is reported in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with the remaining $250 million payment reported in other long-term liabilities. The accretion of the discount is reported within net financing costs in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statement of earnings. A preliminary allocation of the purchase price at September 30, 2016 was $1.0 billion to intangible assets and approximately $400 million to property and equipment.  
 On  August 1, 2016, EnLink formed a joint venture to operate and expand its midstream assets in the Delaware Basin. The joint venture is initially owned 50.1% by EnLink and 49.9% by the joint venture partner. As of September 30, 2016, EnLink contributed approximately $244 million of existing non-monetary assets to the joint venture and had committed an additional $262 million in capital to fund potential future development projects and potential acquisitions. The joint venture partner committed an aggregate of approximately $400 million of capital, including cash contributions of approximately $138 million, and granted EnLink call rights beginning in 2021 to acquire increasing portions of the joint venture partner s interest.   
 Devon Asset Divestitures 
 In the first nine months of 2016, Devon divested certain non-core upstream assets in the U.S., and subsequent to quarter-end, completed the divestiture of its 50% interest in the Access Pipeline in Canada.  
 Upstream Asset Sales 
 In the second quarter of 2016, Devon divested its non-core Mississippian assets for approximately $200 million. Estimated proved reserves associated with these assets were approximately 11 MMBoe, or less than 1% of total U.S. proved reserves.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, in several separate transactions with different purchasers, Devon divested non-core upstream assets located in east Texas, the Anadarko Basin and the Midland Basin for approximately $1.7 billion. Estimated proved reserves associated with these assets were approximately 146 MMBoe, or approximately 9% of total U.S. proved reserves.  
 Proceeds from the transactions have been utilized primarily for debt repayment and to support future capital investment in Devon s core resource plays.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
 (Unaudited) 
   
    Under full cost accounting   rules, sales or other dispositions of oil and ga  s properties are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of gain or loss. However, if not recognizing a gain or loss on the disposition would otherwise significantly alter the relationship between a cost center s ca  pitalized costs and proved reserves, then a gain or loss must be recognized. Absent gain recognition, the divestiture transactions that closed in the third quarter of 2016 would have significantly altered the costs and reserves relationship. Therefore, Dev  on recognized a $1.4 billion gain in the third quarter of 2016 associated with these divestitures. A summary of the gain computation follows.  

Access Pipeline Divestiture 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Access Pipeline assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
 In October 2016, Devon divested Access Pipeline for $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion Canadian dollars) and recognized a gain of approximately $540 million on the transaction. In conjunction with the divestiture, Devon entered into a transportation agreement whereby Devon s Canadian thermal-oil acreage is dedicated to Access Pipeline for an initial term of 25 years. Devon will be charged a market-based toll on its thermal-oil production over this term. In addition, Devon will receive an incremental payment of approximately $120 million upon the sanctioning and development of a new thermal-oil project on Devon s Pike lease in Alberta.  

3.   
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments    

 Objectives and Strategies 
 Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production to hedge future prices received. Additionally, Devon and EnLink periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of their oil, gas and NGL marketing activities. These commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options. Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates. As of September 30, 2016, Devon did not have any open foreign exchange contracts. 
 Devon does not intend to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and has elected not to designate any of its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment. 
 As of December 31, 2015, Devon s other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included $236 million of accrued settlements that it received in January 2016. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
   By using derivative financial instruments, Devon is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom Devon believes are acceptable credit risks. It is Devon s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment-grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devon s  
 12 

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
 (Unaudited) 
   
  derivative contracts generally contain provisions that provide for collateral payments, if Devon   s   or its counterparty s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels.  
 As of December 31, 2015, Devon held $75 million of cash collateral which represented the estimated fair value of certain derivative positions in excess of Devon s credit guidelines. The collateral is reported in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

      Share-Based Compensation     

 The following table presents the effects of share-based compensation included in Devon s accompanying consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings. Gross G A expense for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 includes $18 million and $25 million, respectively, of unit-based compensation related to grants made under EnLink s long-term incentive plans. 
 The vesting for certain share-based awards was accelerated in 2016 in conjunction with the reduction of workforce described in Note 6. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $60 million of associated expense for these accelerated awards is included in restructuring and transaction costs in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings.    

Under its approved long-term incentive plan, Devon granted share-based awards to certain employees in the first nine months of 2016. The following table presents a summary of Devon s unvested restricted stock awards and units, performance-based restricted stock awards and performance share units granted under the plan.

 Asset Impairments    

 The following table presents the components of asset impairments.  

Oil and Gas Impairments 
 Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD A and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the full cost  ceiling  at the end of each quarter. The ceiling is calculated separately for each country and is based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10% per annum, net of related tax effects. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months. 
 The oil and gas impairments resulted from declines in the U.S. and Canada full cost ceilings. The lower ceiling values resulted primarily from significant decreases in the 12-month average trailing prices for oil, bitumen, gas and NGLs, which significantly reduced proved reserves values and, to a lesser degree, proved reserves. 
 EnLink Goodwill Impairments and Other Intangible Assets Impairments 
 In the first quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015, Devon recognized goodwill and other intangible assets impairments related to EnLink s business. Additional information regarding the impairments is discussed in Note 12.

      Restructuring and Transaction Costs      

 The following table summarizes restructuring and transaction costs presented in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statement of earnings. 

The following table summarizes Devon s restructuring liabilities. 

Reduction in Workforce 
 In the first nine months of 2016, Devon recognized $229 million in employee-related costs associated with a reduction in workforce that was made in response to the depressed commodity price environment. Of these employee-related costs, approximately $60 million resulted from accelerated vesting of share-based grants, which are noncash charges. Additionally, approximately $30 million resulted from estimated defined benefit settlements. These cash and noncash charges included estimates for employees released from service during the first nine months of 2016, as well as amounts based on the number of employees expected to be impacted by certain of its non-core asset divestitures. 
 As a result of the reduction in workforce and asset divestitures, Devon ceased using certain office space that was subject to non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Consequently, Devon recognized $17 million of restructuring costs that represent the present value of its future obligations under the leases. Additionally, Devon recognized $3 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space it ceased using. 
 Transaction Costs 
 In the first nine months of 2016, Devon and EnLink recognized transaction costs primarily associated with the closing of the acquisitions discussed in Note 2.

      Income Taxes     

 The following table presents Devon s total income tax expense (benefit) and a reconciliation of its effective income tax rate to the U.S. statutory income tax rate. 

Devon estimates its annual effective income tax rate in recording its quarterly provision for income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Statutory tax rate changes and other significant or unusual items are recognized as discrete items in the quarter in which they occur. 
 At December 31, 2015, Devon recorded a 100%, or $967 million, valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets that largely resulted from the full cost impairments recognized during 2015. In the first and second quarters of 2016, Devon provided an additional $808 and $467 million, respectively, deferred tax valuation allowance to reflect its continued financial losses incurred largely by the additional full cost impairments. In the third quarter of 2016, Devon s U.S. segment reduced its deferred tax valuation allowance by $479 million primarily due to the gain from the sale of assets recorded during the quarter. Also during the third quarter of 2016, Devon s Canadian segment recorded a $71 million partial valuation allowance due to its continued financial losses.  
 In the first quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015, EnLink recorded goodwill and intangibles impairments totaling $873 million and $799 million, respectively. These impairments are not deductible for purposes of calculating income tax and therefore have an impact on the effective tax rate. 
 Devon is under audit in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business. The timing of resolution of income tax examinations is uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. Devon believes that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that certain tax examinations will be resolved by settlement with the taxing authorities. During the third quarter of 2016, Devon recognized $85 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $34 million of interest, associated with such tax examinations.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    

 Goodwill 
 Devon performs an annual impairment test of goodwill at October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low commodity prices, together with a decline in EnLink s unit price, caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test of EnLink s reporting units in the first quarter of 2016. Based on that test, EnLink recorded a noncash goodwill impairment of $873 million. This consisted of a full impairment charge of $93 million related to its Crude and Condensate reporting unit and partial impairment to its Texas and General Partner reporting units of $473 million and $307 million, respectively. 
 In the third quarter of 2015, EnLink recorded a noncash goodwill impairment of $576 million related to its Louisiana reporting unit as a result of an interim impairment test. 
 Asset Divestitures 
 During the third quarter of 2016, Devon derecognized $197 million of goodwill in conjunction with the upstream oil and gas asset divestitures discussed in Note 2.

    Other Intangible Assets   
 The following table presents other intangible assets reported in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 2 for discussion of changes in other intangible assets resulting from EnLink acquisitions during the first nine months of 2016. 
 In the third quarter of 2015, Devon recorded a noncash intangible assets impairment of $223 million related to EnLink s Crude and Condensate reporting unit resulting from an assessment of EnLink s customer relationships. Level 3 fair value measurements were utilized for the impairment analysis of definite-lived intangible assets, which included discounted cash flow estimates, consistent with those utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment.  

The weighted-average amortization period for other intangible assets is 14 years. Amortization expense for intangibles was approximately $29 million and $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $87 million and $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remaining amortization expense is estimated to be $118 million for each of the next five years.

    Retirement of Senior Notes  
 In August 2016, Devon completed tender offers to repurchase $1.2 billion of debt securities, using proceeds from the asset divestitures discussed in Note 2. The redemption includes $97 million of the $125 million 8.25% senior notes due July 2018, $640 million of the $750 million 2.25% senior notes due December 2018 and $502 million of the $700 million 6.3% senior notes due January 2019. Devon recognized a loss on early retirement of debt, primarily consisting of $82 million in cash retirement costs and other fees. These costs, along with other minimal noncash charges associated with retiring the debt, are included in net financing costs in the consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings. 
   
 Credit Lines 
 Devon has a $3.0 billion Senior Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, Devon had $125 million in outstanding letters of credit, including $58 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility at September 30, 2016. The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than 65%. Under the terms of the credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial write-downs such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of September 30, 2016, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 20.6%. 
 EnLink Debt  
 All of EnLink s and the General Partner s debt is non-recourse to Devon. 
 EnLink has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, there were $11 million in outstanding letters of credit and $75 million in outstanding borrowings at an average rate of 2.15% under the $1.5 billion credit facility. The General Partner has a $250 million secured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, the General Partner had $23 million in outstanding borrowings at an average rate of 2.28%. EnLink and the General Partner were in compliance with all financial covenants in their respective credit facilities as of September 30, 2016. 
 In July 2016, EnLink issued $500 million of 4.85% unsecured senior notes due 2026.  EnLink used the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.

 Subsidiary Equity Transactions 
 During the first quarter of 2016, EnLink issued common units in conjunction with the acquisition discussed in Note 2. In addition, during the first nine months of 2016, EnLink issued approximately 7 million common units for net proceeds of $110 million. As a result of these transactions, Devon s ownership interest in EnLink decreased from 28% at December 31, 2015 to 24% at September 30, 2016, excluding the interest held by the General Partner. Additionally, as a result of the transaction described in Note 2, Devon s ownership in the General Partner decreased from 70% to 64% during the same time period. The net gains and losses and related income taxes resulting from these transactions have been recorded as an adjustment to equity, with the change in ownership reflected as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests. 
 Distributions to Noncontrolling Interests 
 EnLink and the General Partner distributed $224 million and $186 million to non-Devon unitholders during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Commitments and Contingencies    

 Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, Devon s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals. Actual amounts could differ materially from management s estimates. 
 Royalty Matters 
   Numerous oil and natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement techniques and entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with oil, natural gas and NGLs produced and sold. Devon is also involved in governmental

  agency proceedings and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary course of business, some that may lead to a  dditional royalty claims. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with respect to such royalty matters.  
 Environmental Matters 
 Devon is subject to certain environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss accruals primarily consist of estimated uninsured remediation costs. Devon s monetary exposure for environmental matters is not expected to be material. 
 Other Matters 
 Devon is involved in other various legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devon s knowledge, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

 Fair Value Measurements    

 The following table provides carrying value and fair value measurement information for certain of Devon s financial assets and liabilities. The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, other current receivables, accounts payable, other current payables and accrued expenses included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Therefore, such financial assets and liabilities are not presented in the following table. Additionally, the fair values of oil and gas assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and related impairments are measured as of the impairment date using Level 3 inputs. More information on these items is provided in Note 5 and Note 12.    

28 

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
 (Unaudited) 
   
    The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values in the table above.  
 Level 1 Fair Value Measurements 
 Cash equivalents    Amounts consist primarily of money market investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.  
 Level 2 Fair Value Measurements 
 Cash equivalents    Amounts consist primarily of commercial paper and Canadian agency and provincial securities investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.  
 Commodity, interest rate and foreign currency derivatives    The fair values of commodity, interest rate and foreign currency derivatives are estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained from independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements.  
 Debt    Devon s debt instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The fair values of its debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity. The fair values of commercial paper and credit facility balances are the carrying values.  
 Installment payment    The fair value of the EnLink installment payment as of September 30, 2016 was based on Level 2 inputs from third-party market quotations.  
 Capital lease obligations    The fair value was calculated using inputs from third-party banks.  

21.   
 
 Segment Information    

 Devon manages its operations through distinct operating segments, which are defined primarily by geographic areas. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of the businesses. However, Devon s Canadian E P operating segment is reported as a separate reporting segment primarily due to the significant differences between the U.S. and Canadian regulatory environments. Devon s U.S. and Canadian segments are both primarily engaged in oil and gas E P activities. 
 Devon considers EnLink, combined with the General Partner, to be an operating segment that is distinct from the U.S. and Canadian operating segments. EnLink s operations consist of midstream assets and operations located across the U.S. Additionally, EnLink has a management team that is primarily responsible for capital and resource allocation decisions. Therefore, EnLink is presented as a separate reporting segment.

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 The following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in our results of operations and capital resources and uses for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and in our financial condition and liquidity since December 31, 2015. For information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K under  Item 7.

 Overview of 2016 Results 
 Key components of our financial performance are summarized below.

  Core earnings (loss) and core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon are financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of core earnings (loss) and core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon, as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, see  Non-GAAP Measures  in this Item 2.

(3)   
 
  Except for balance sheet amounts, which are presented as of September 30.     

Despite the challenges our company and the entire upstream energy sector faced from low commodity prices in 2016, we have remained committed to the execution of our strategy and to positioning our company for long-term success. Although we have seen moderate improvements in oil and natural gas prices over the course of the first nine months of 2016, prices still remain relatively low with an average NYMEX WTI oil price and Henry Hub natural gas price of $41.41/Bbl and $2.28/Mcf, respectively. In spite of this, we continue to take strategic steps to create value for our shareholders by making prudent investments and upgrades to our portfolio of assets, bringing the value of our assets forward by executing on key divestiture initiatives, further optimizing our production operations to minimize production declines and controlling costs to further strengthen our balance sheet. During the first nine months of 2016, these steps were marked by several notable achievements: 

Expanded our position in the STACK by acquiring approximately 80,000 net acres and assets for $1.5 billion.     

Reduced exploratory and developmental capital investment by approximately 70% as compared to the first nine months of 2015.     

Raised net proceeds of $1.5 billion in an offering of our common stock.     

Divested U.S. non-core upstream assets for $1.9 billion. We divested our interest in Access Pipeline for $1.1 billion in October 2016, bringing total divestiture proceeds to approximately $3.2 billion before purchase price  adjustments.      

Reduced long-term debt by $1.2 billion using asset divestiture proceeds.      

31 

Reduced LOE by $410   million   through the first nine months of 2016 as compare  d to the same time period in 201  5, primarily through cost reduction initiatives.     

Reduced gross G A by $308 million through the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same time period in 2015, primarily through cost reduction initiatives resulting from our February 2016 workforce reduction.     

Raised our 2016 operating costs savings target to $1 billion.      

Exited the third quarter of 2016 with $5.3 billion of liquidity, consisting of $2.4 billion of cash and $2.9 billion of capacity on our Senior Credit Facility. We have managed our debt maturity schedule to provide maximum flexibility with near-term liquidity, with no significant long-term debt maturities until July 2021.      

 In conjunction with the workforce reduction and transactions discussed above, we incurred $266 million of restructuring and transaction costs in the first nine months of 2016. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2016, we recognized $4.9 billion of noncash asset impairments as a result of low commodity prices. Furthermore, we recognized a gain of $1.4 billion on the asset divestitures that closed in the third quarter of 2016. While the impairments and gain on divestitures significantly impacted our earnings, they had no effect on our operating cash flow or debt covenants.

Oil, Gas and NGL Pricing  

(1)   
 
 Prices presented exclude any effects of oil, gas and NGL derivatives.    

     Commodity Sales 
 The volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our commodity sales between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Commodity sales decreased due to a change in production volumes from our retained assets during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016. While enhanced positions in the STACK, continued development activity in the Delaware and our performance of our Jackfish assets drove production increases, these production increases were more than offset by reduced completion activity in the Eagle Ford and natural production declines in the Barnett Shale. Additionally, our production decreased as a result of our U.S. non-core divestiture program.   
 Commodity sales decreased in the first nine months of 2016 due to significant price decreases for all commodities. The decrease in oil and bitumen sales resulted from lower average WTI crude oil index prices, which were 19% lower than the first nine months of 2015. The decreases in gas and NGL sales were due to lower North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based, and lower NGL prices at the Mont Belvieu, Texas hub.  
 34 

Oil, Gas and NGL Derivatives  
 A summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in Note 3 to the financial statements included in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. The following tables provide financial information associated with our oil, gas and NGL hedges. The first table presents the cash settlements and fair value gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues. The subsequent tables present our oil, gas and NGL prices with, and without, the effects of the cash settlements. The prices do not include the effects of fair value gains and losses.  

Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to various commodity derivatives. In addition to cash settlements, we also recognize fair value changes on our oil, gas and NGL derivative instruments in each reporting period. The changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period, as well as the  
 35 

relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves. Including the cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives generated net gains in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015. Including the ca  sh settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives incurred a net loss in the first nine months of 2016 and generated a net gain in the first nine months of 2015.  
 Marketing and Midstream Revenues and Operating Expenses 

The overall decrease in marketing and midstream margin during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to lower margins on Devon s downstream marketing commitments, offset by EnLink s acquisition activity in late 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. 
 Gains on Asset Sales 
 In conjunction with the non-core upstream asset divestitures, we recognized a gain during the third quarter of 2016. For further discussion, see Note 2 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. 
 Lease Operating Expenses 

LOE and LOE per Boe decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to our well optimization and cost reduction initiatives and non-core oil and gas property divestitures. Our cost reduction initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing costs associated with water disposal, power and fuel, compression and workovers.  
 By closing the Access Pipeline divestiture discussed in Note 2 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements,  we expect LOE to increase approximately $25 million in the last three months of 2016 due to our base transportation commitment to the pipeline for our thermal-oil production. 
 36 

General and Administrative Expenses  

Gross G A and capitalized G A decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 largely due to lower Devon employee costs resulting from recent workforce reductions, as discussed in Note 6 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements,  and other cost reduction initiatives. Reimbursed G A decreased primarily due to a reduction in drilling activity in response to the decline in commodity prices.  
 Production and Property Taxes 

Production taxes decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to a decrease in our U.S. revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed. Furthermore, property and other taxes decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing authorities across our key operating areas. Property taxes do not change in direct correlation with the decline in oil, gas and NGL sales and are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.  
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 

DD A from our oil and gas properties decreased in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 largely due to lower DD A rates, as a result of the oil and gas asset impairments recognized in 2015 and the first and second quarter of 2016. Other DD A increased primarily due to EnLink s acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. 
 Asset Impairments 
 We recognized asset impairments during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. For further discussion, see Note 5 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. 
 37 

Restructuring and Transaction Costs  
 During the first nine months of 2016, we recognized restructuring costs of $249 million as a result of the workforce reductions, which were driven by our cost reduction initiatives and divestitures of non-core properties. The original restructuring costs charge included estimated employee-related cash and noncash severance costs afforded under the terms of our severance policy and included certain assumptions with respect to the timing of employee terminations and the number of employees receiving employment offers from the purchasers of our divested assets. In addition, we incurred lease obligation costs due to non-cancellable operating lease agreements and asset impairments related to vacated office space. As of September 30, 2016, we had completed the planned divestitures of our non-core upstream assets, and as a result of the divestitures and associated employee terminations, in the third quarter of 2016 we decreased our original estimate of employee related costs by approximately $7 million. See Note 6 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. 
 During the first nine months of 2016, we recognized transaction costs of $17 million, primarily associated with the closing of the acquisitions discussed in Note 2 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. 
 Net Financing Costs 

Net financing costs increased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to the early retirement of fixed-rate senior note debt in the third quarter of 2016. See Note 14 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. Furthermore, net financing costs increased from the prior year due to Devon and EnLink fixed-rate borrowings and accretion of future installment payments related to EnLink acquisition activity in the first quarter of 2016. For further discussion of the accretion of future installment payments, see Note 2 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report.    
 As a result of the early retirement of long term debt, and excluding the one-time costs we incurred upon retirement, we expect a decline in net financing costs in future reporting periods. We estimate that our total cash interest expense will be reduced by approximately $54 million on an annualized basis. For further discussion of debt repayments, see Note 14 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report. 
 Income Taxes 

For further discussion on income taxes, see Note 7 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report.

Capital Resources, Uses and Liquidity  
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The following table presents the major changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Operating Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 72% primarily due to lower commodity prices and the impact of cash settlements associated with our commodity derivatives during 2015. 
 Excluding payments made for acquisitions, our consolidated operating cash flow funded 73% and 100% of our capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, leveraging our liquidity, we also used cash balances and proceeds from our common stock offering and non-core divestitures to fund our acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
 Issuance of Common Stock 
 In February 2016, we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public, inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part of the underwriters  option. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.5 billion. 
 Divestitures of Property and Equipment 
 During the first nine months of 2016, we divested certain non-core upstream assets in the U.S. for approximately $1.9 billion. Proceeds from these divestitures were used primarily for debt repayment and to support capital investment in Devon s core resource plays. We do not expect to have significant current cash income taxes resulting from these divestitures. For further discussion, see Note 2 in  Part 1. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements.  
 39 

Capital Expenditures and Ac  quisitions of Property, Equipment and Businesses  
 The amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures, including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods. 

Capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations, midstream operations, other corporate activities and EnLink growth and maintenance activities. The vast majority of Devon s capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties. In response to lower commodity prices, Devon s 2016 capital program is designed to be substantially lower than 2015, evidenced by a 67% decrease in exploration and development costs from the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015.  
 Capital expenditures for Devon s and EnLink s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines. Midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling and development activities. 
 Acquisition capital for the first nine months of 2016 primarily consisted of Devon s acquisition of assets in the STACK play for approximately $1.5 billion and EnLink s acquisition of Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets for $1.5 billion. Approximately $849 million and $792 million, respectively, was paid in cash at the closings with the remainder of the purchase prices funded with equity consideration and debt. For additional information, see Note 2 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  in this report. 
 Debt Activity, Net 
 During the first nine months of 2016, our consolidated net debt borrowings decreased $1.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to completed tender offers to purchase and redeem $1.2 billion of debt securities. For additional information, see Note 14 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  in this report. The remaining decrease was due to reducing our commercial paper balances by $626 million during the first nine months of 2016. 
 In June 2015, we issued $750 million of 5.0% senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay the aggregate principal amount of our December 15, 2015 floating rate senior notes, as well as outstanding commercial paper balances. Our net debt borrowings during the first nine months of 2015 increased $623 million, which was primarily due to EnLink borrowings made to fund acquisitions and dropdowns. 
 40 

Sharehol  der and Noncontrolling Interests Distributions  
 The following table summarizes our common stock dividends during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we decreased our quarterly dividend to $0.06 per share. 

EnLink and the General Partner distributed $224 million and $186 million to non-Devon unitholders during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 EnLink and General Partner Distributions 
 Devon received $199 million and $202 million in distributions from EnLink and the General Partner during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 EnLink Dropdowns 
 In the second quarter of 2015, Devon received $171 million in cash from EnLink in exchange for ownership of VEX. 
 Issuance of Subsidiary Units 
 In February 2016, as part of its acquisition of Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets, EnLink issued 50 million preferred units in a private placement generating cash proceeds of approximately $725 million. The remainder of the purchase price was funded with General Partner common units. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2016, EnLink issued 7 million common units for net proceeds of $110 million. 
 Sale of Subsidiary Units 
 In March 2015, we conducted an underwritten secondary public offering of approximately 23 million common units representing limited partner interests in EnLink, raising proceeds of $569 million, net of underwriting discount. In April 2015, as part of the secondary public offering, the underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase an additional approximate 3 million common units, raising $85 million of net proceeds. 
 Liquidity 
 Historically, our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow and cash on hand. Additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. Available sources of capital and liquidity include, among others, debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, as well as the sale of a portion of our common units representing interests in our investment in EnLink and the General Partner. The most significant source of liquidity in 2016 has come from proceeds related to our asset divestitures. Through September 30, 2016, we have closed approximately $1.9 billion of asset divestitures, with an additional $1.1 billion that closed in early October 2016. We estimate the combination of these sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund future capital expenditures, debt repayments and other contractual commitments. 
 41 

Operating Cash Flow  
 Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil, bitumen, gas and NGLs we produce and sell. Our consolidated operating cash flow decreased 72% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 as a result of the significant decreases in commodity prices, as well as in the settlement value of our hedge contracts. In spite of this decline, we expect operating cash flow to continue to be a key source of liquidity as we adjust our capital program in response to lower commodity prices. Additionally, we anticipate utilizing divestiture proceeds and our credit availability to provide additional liquidity as needed.  
 To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. For additional information, see Note 3 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  in this report.  
 Capital Expenditures  
 With the success of the asset divestitures discussed above, we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund the remainder of our 2016 capital program. Excluding acquisitions and EnLink, we expect fourth quarter capital expenditures to range from $470 million to $520 million.  
 Credit Availability 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $2.9 billion available under our $3.0 billion Senior Credit Facility, net of $58 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Senior Credit Facility. This credit facility supports our $3.0 billion commercial paper program. At September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
 The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than 65%. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 20.6%. 
 EnLink has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, and the General Partner has a $250 million secured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, there were $11 million in outstanding letters of credit and $75 million in outstanding borrowings under the $1.5 billion credit facility, and the General Partner had $23 million in outstanding borrowings under the $250 million credit facility. 
 EnLink Capital Resources and Expenditures 
 In January 2016, EnLink acquired additional gathering and processing midstream assets in the Anadarko Basin for approximately $1.5 billion in cash and equity, subject to certain adjustments. The first installment of $1.0 billion for the acquisition was paid at closing, and the final installment of $500 million is due no later than the first anniversary of the closing date, with the option to defer $250 million of the final installment up to 24 months following the closing date. 
 Debt Ratings 
 We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. In February 2016, our credit rating was revised by Standard   Poor s Financial Services from BBB+ with a negative outlook to BBB with a stable outlook. In March 2016, Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB+ rating but revised our outlook from stable to negative. In July 2016, Moody s Investor Service revised our senior unsecured rating from Ba2 with negative outlook to a stable outlook. A downgrade in ratings required us to post letters of credit as financial assurance of performance under certain contractual arrangements. Any further rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit. 
 There are no  rating triggers  in any of our or EnLink s contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. However, these downgrades could adversely impact our and EnLink s interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future. 
 42 

Contractual Obligations  
 As discussed in Note 2 in  Part 1. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report, we closed on the sale of our 50% interest in the Access Pipeline in October 2016. Under the terms of the related transportation agreement, we dedicated our thermal-oil acreage to Access Pipeline for an initial term of 25 years. The agreement contains a base transportation commitment, which for the initial 5 years, averages $110 million annually.  

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Full Cost Method of Accounting and Proved Reserves 
 Under the full cost method of accounting, sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of a gain or loss. The determination of whether a gain or loss is to be recognized is dependent upon whether the disposition significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, the conclusion of which involves a significant amount of judgment. The non-core oil and gas property divestiture transactions discussed in Note 2 in  Part 1. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this report significantly altered such relationship and resulted in the recognition of a gain in the third quarter of 2016.   
 We perform a full cost ceiling impairment test each quarter for our U.S. and Canadian oil and gas properties. The ceiling tests for the first nine months of 2016 resulted in recognizing ceiling impairments on our U.S. and Canadian properties totaling $4.0 billion. 
 Depending on the relationship between our capitalized costs and calculated full cost ceiling at the time of the most recent ceiling test performed, uncertain future prices limit our ability to predict and measure potential future full cost impairments. However, because the ceiling test computation uses a 12-month trailing price to determine future cash flows, we can typically predict when circumstances will result in future impairments that are material, particularly in the next one to two quarters. However, due to the nature of estimating future cash flows, measuring any potential impairments is more difficult. 
 Based on prices from the last nine months of the trailing 12-month average, the short-term pricing outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the Access Pipeline divestiture in the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize additional U.S. and Canadian full cost impairments in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate the impairment on our Canadian oil and gas properties to approximate $500 million. We estimate the impairment on our U.S. full cost pool during the fourth quarter of 2016 to be less than the impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2016. Our full cost impairments have no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, they adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized. 
 Goodwill 
 We test goodwill for impairment annually at October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low commodity prices, together with a decline in the EnLink unit price, caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test for EnLink s reporting units in the first quarter of 2016. 
 The goodwill assessment is performed at the reporting unit level and primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis, supplemented by a market approach analysis in the assessment. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, terminal year multiples and estimated future cash flows, including volume forecasts and estimated operating and G A costs. In estimating cash flows, current and historical market information, among other factors, are incorporated. 
 Using the fair value approaches described above, in the first quarter of 2016 it was determined that the estimated fair value of EnLink s Texas, General Partner and Crude and Condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts, primarily due to changes in assumptions related to commodity prices and discount rates. Through the analysis, a goodwill impairment loss of $473 million, $307 million and $93 million for EnLink s Texas, General Partner and Crude and Condensate reporting units, respectively, was recognized in the first quarter of 2016. 
 As of March 31, 2016, the goodwill allocated to the Crude and Condensate reporting unit was fully impaired. Other than those mentioned above, no other goodwill impairment was identified or recorded for the remaining reporting units as a result of the interim goodwill assessment, as their estimated fair values were in excess of carrying values. However, the fair value of EnLink s Texas and General Partner reporting units are not substantially in excess of their carrying value. The fair value of the Texas and General Partner reporting units approximates their carrying values after considering the impairment loss above, and, as of September 30, 2016, $230 million and $1.1 billion of goodwill remains allocated to the reporting units, respectively. 
 43 

Our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed above. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various   valuations. If actual future results are not consistent with these assumptions and estimates, or the assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges, which would be recognized in the per  iod in which we would determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value. We would expect that a prolonged or sustained period of lower commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of future operating results, which could result in future goodwil  l impairments for other reporting units due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations.  
 The goodwill impairment has no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it adversely affects net earnings in the period recognized. 
 Income Taxes 
 The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. We recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. We routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets that largely resulted from the full cost impairments recognized during 2015. Despite the financial earnings in the third quarter of 2016, based on our current realization assessment we continued to have a 100% valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016. Further, in the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a $71 million valuation allowance against certain Canadian deferred tax assets as a result of continued financial losses. 
 The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. Material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of other pending matters. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We make reference to  core earnings (loss) attributable to Devon  and  core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon  in  Overview of 2016 Results  in this Item 2. that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Core earnings (loss) attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. Amounts excluded for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and foreign currency, noncash asset impairments (including an impairment of goodwill), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, gains on asset sales, costs associated with the early retirement of debt and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2016 workforce reduction. Amounts excluded for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and noncash asset impairments. We believe these non-GAAP measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. We also believe these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers. 
 44 

Below are reconciliations of our core earnings (loss) and core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon to their comparable GAAP measures.   

45 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitati  ve Disclosures About Market Risk  
 Commodity Price Risk 
 As of September 30, 2016, we have commodity derivatives that pertain to a portion of our production for the last three months of 2016, as well as 2017 and 2018. The key terms to our open oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments are presented in Note 3 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  in this report. 
 The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At September 30, 2016, a 10% change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by the following amounts: 

Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2016, we had total debt of $11.4 billion. Of this amount, $10.9 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 5.5%, and approximately $450 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 1.6%. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in Note 3 in  Part I. Financial Information   Item 1. Financial Statements  in this report. The fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the 3-month LIBOR rate. A 10% change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet at September 30, 2016. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our September 30, 2016 balance sheet. 
 Our non-Canadian foreign subsidiaries have a U.S. dollar functional currency. However, some of our subsidiaries hold Canadian-dollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with Canadian subsidiaries that are based in Canadian dollars. The value of the Canadian-dollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash and loans into the U.S. dollar functional currency.  
   
   Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Devon, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Devon s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
 Based on their evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 46 

PART II. Other Information  
   Item 1.    Legal Proceedings  
 We are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject. 
   
 Please see our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 for additional information regarding the Company s pending negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to alleged noncompliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of Environmental Protection Agency regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act at our Beaver Creek Gas Plant located near Riverton, Wyoming. 
   Item 1A.    Risk Factors  
 There have been no material changes to the information included in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
 The following table provides information regarding purchases of our common stock that were made by us during the third quarter of 2016. 

(1)   
 
 Share repurchases represent shares received by us from employees and directors for the payment of personal income tax withholding on vesting of awards and exercises of stock options.    

 Under the Devon Plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of our common stock through an investment in the Devon Stock Fund, which is administered by an independent trustee. Eligible employees purchased approximately 11,900 shares of our common stock in the third quarter of 2016, at then-prevailing stock prices, that they held through their ownership in the Stock Fund. We acquired the shares of our common stock sold under the Devon Plan through open-market purchases. 
 Similarly, eligible Canadian employees may purchase shares of our common stock through an investment in the Canadian Plan, which is administered by an independent trustee, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. Shares sold under the Canadian Plan were acquired through open-market purchases. These shares and any interest in the Canadian Plan were offered and sold in reliance on the exemptions for offers and sales of securities made outside of the U.S., including under Regulation S for offers and sales of securities to employees pursuant to an employee benefit plan established and administered in accordance with the law of a country other than the U.S. In the third quarter of 2016, there were no shares purchased by Canadian employees.
