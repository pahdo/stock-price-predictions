1.  
      Nature
    of Business and Continuance of Operations   

Oculus
    Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 9, 2014. The Company is in the business
    of selling and providing services for GPS Tracking Devices which will be marketed in the United States, Canada and Europe.   

These
    financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets
    and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
    upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing
    to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at October 31, 2016, the Company has incurred losses
    totalling $111,037 since inception, and has not yet generated any revenue from operations. These factors raise substantial
    doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any
    adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
    be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management is currently pursuing a business strategy
    which includes raising the necessary funds to finance the Company s business activities and administrative expenses.   

2.  
      Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies   

a)  
      Basis
    of Presentation   

These
    financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States and are expressed in US dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is April 30.   

b)  
      Interim
    Financial Statements   

The
    accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ),
    and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s
    April 30, 2016 report filed with the SEC on Form 10K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal
    recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim
    periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
    of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the
    disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year end April 30, 2016, have been omitted.   

c)  
      Use
    of Estimates   

The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation
    allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
    that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
    the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates.
    To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will
    be affected.   

d)  
      Foreign
    Currency Translation   

The
    Company s planned operations will be in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia which results in exposure to market
    risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The financial risk is the risk to the Company s operations that
    arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does
    not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. The Company s functional currency for
    all operations worldwide is the U.S. dollar. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates and monetary
    assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the end of the year. Revenues and expenses are translated
    at average rates for the year. Gains and losses from translation of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars
    are included in current results of operations.

   Notes
to the Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

e)  
      Cash
    and Cash Equivalents   

The
    Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.   

f)  
      Income
    Taxes   

Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
    expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed
    more likely than not to be realized.   

g)  
      Revenue
    Recognition   

Sales
    will be recorded when products are shipped or services are provided to customers. Provisions for discounts and rebates to
    customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are
    recorded. No provision for discounts or rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances or other adjustments have been
    recognized since inception. The Company has not made any sales as at October 31, 2016.   

h)  
      Financial
    Instruments   

The
    Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable,
    and due to related party. Pursuant to ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  and ASC 825,  Financial Instruments
     the fair value of the Company s cash equivalents is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist
    of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.   

i)  
      Earnings
    (Loss) Per Common Share   

Basic
    EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number
    of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
    during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing
    Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from
    the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti dilutive.
    At October 31, 2016, the Company has no potentially dilutive securities outstanding.   

j)  
      Stock-Based
    Compensation   

Compensation
    costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date,
    and expensed over the expected vesting period. ASC 718 requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow
    rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The Company did not grant any stock options during the six months ended October
    31, 2016.   

k)  
      Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements   

The
    Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements
    and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
    impact on its financial position or results of operations.   

l)  
      Subsequent
    Events   

The
    Company evaluates subsequent events through the date when financial statements are issued for disclosure consideration.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  should ,  expects ,
 plans ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,  potential 
or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions
and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the
forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  

Our
unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related
notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect
our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere
in this quarterly report.  

Unless
otherwise specified in this quarterly report, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to
 common stock  refer to shares of our common stock.  

As
used in this quarterly report, the terms  we ,  us ,  our  and  our company  mean
Oculus Inc., unless otherwise indicated. We have no subsidiaries.  

Corporate
Overview    

We
were incorporated on January 9, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada. We have predominately been involved in administrative
activities such as setting up bank accounts, establishing relationships with service providers and establishing our office facilities.  

We
are a company in the business of selling and providing services for GPS Tracking Devices. Our product, called the AnyTrack GPS
is a next generation remote personal locator device used to primarily located and aid in the timely rescue of missing children,
the elderly and pets. In addition, our devices will have additional functionalities, such as keeping track of heart rates, with
data being sent remotely and in the future we will add additional functionalities such as keeping track of blood alcohol content,
which will be useful for parolees or anyone that has been convicted of a DUI. In addition to selling these devices, we will offer
monthly services, such as tracking and data collection at a monthly fee. We plan to market our devices to the U.S., Canada and
Europe and then extending to Asia.  

On
June 20, 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Shenzhen Coban Electronics Co., Ltd. for the supply of the GPS tracking
devices we plan on marketing as AnyTrack GPS. This is a non-exclusive distribution agreement for the territories of North America,
Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Europe. We are required to purchase a total of 100 devices as an initial order and an additional
100 devices in the first year of the agreement in order for the agreement to be extended. The devices carry a manufacturer s
warranty of one year. Our company has purchased 100 devices for its initial order for a total of $3,026. Initially, we plan to
re-sell these devices to the public under our AnyTrack brand name. As of October 31, 2016, we have not sold any of these devices
yet. We plan on developing proprietary products such as wristbands, watches, or dog collars which will incorporate these devices.  

Our
products and services, as well as our website and mobile interface are all in the development stage. We have only recently begun
operations, have no sales or revenues, and therefore rely upon the sale of our securities to fund our operations. We have a going
concern uncertainty as of the date of our most recent financial statements.  

We
intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing by way
of private placements. We currently do not have any arrangements or commitments in place to complete any private placement financings
in an amount sufficient to further our business plan and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such
financings on terms that will be acceptable to us. We are actively seeking additional funding, but have not closed any such funding
as of this date.  

If
we are not able to raise the full $265,000 budget that we require to implement our business plan as anticipated, we will scale
our business development in line with available capital. Our primary priority will be to retain our reporting status with the
SEC which means that we will first ensure that we have sufficient capital to cover our corporate, legal and accounting expenses.
We will likely not expend funds on the remainder of our planned activities unless we have the required capital.  

The
address of our principal executive office is 1451 W Cypress Creek Road, Suite 300, Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33309, United States. Our
telephone number is (888) 623-8883. Our fiscal year end is April 30.  

Anticipated
Cash Requirements    

We
intend to continue to develop our website, purchase additional product to sell to customers and market our company during the
next twelve months. We estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next twelve months to be as follows:  

Months
1-3   

Months
4-6   

Months
7-9   

Months
10-12   

In
order to fully carry out our business plan, we need additional financing of approximately $265,000 for the next 12 months as we
have no cash on hand as of October 31, 2016. In order to improve our liquidity, we intend to pursue additional equity financing
from private placement sales of our equity securities or shareholders  loans. We do not presently have sufficient financing
to undertake our planned business activities. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders.  

We
currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any further private placement financings and there is no
assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary
additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and administrative expenses
in order to be within the amount of capital resources that are available to us.  

Results
of Operations   

We
have not generated any revenues from our operations since inception.  

Our
operating expenses for the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are outlined in the table below:  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $8,545 and $14,490, respectively. Our net losses for the three
month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,174 and $14,794, respectively.  

Operating
expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $12,754 and $19,050, respectively. Our net losses for the three
month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $14,112 and $20,233, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Working
Capital   

Cash
Flows   

As
of October 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $69,934 and $736 in current assets compared to a working capital deficit
of $55,822 and $736 in current assets as of April 30, 2016.  

We
spent a total of $5,095 on operating activities which we financed through a loan from a third party during the six months ended
October 31, 2016. During the six months ended October 31, 2015, we used $13,525 on operating activities which was financed by
cash we had on hand.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to stockholders.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe
that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial
statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Sales
will be recorded when products are shipped or services are provided to customers. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers,
estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. No
provision for discounts or rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances or other adjustments have been recognized as
at October 31, 2016. Our company had not made any sales as at October 31, 2016.

We

filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer
and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
of the end of our quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing,
our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance in the reliability
of our reports as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

1.
I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 of Oculus, Inc. (the  registrant );  

2.
Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material

in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
presented in this quarterly report;  

4.
I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
registrant and have:  

a)  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b)  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
    and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
    and   

c)  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; and   

d)  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.   

5.
I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors
and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

a)  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b)  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
