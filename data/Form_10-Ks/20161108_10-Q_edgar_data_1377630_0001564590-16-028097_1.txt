        1.  THE   COMPANY  
 Description of Business 
 National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCM, Inc. ) was incorporated in Delaware as a holding company with the sole purpose of becoming a member and sole manager of National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM LLC ), a limited liability company owned by NCM, Inc., American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and AMC ShowPlace Theatres, Inc. ( AMC ), wholly owned subsidiaries of AMC Entertainment, Inc., Regal Cinemas, Inc. and Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC, wholly owned subsidiaries of Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ) and Cinemark Media, Inc. and Cinemark USA, Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. ( Cinemark ).  The terms  NCM ,  the Company  or  we  shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be deemed to include the consolidated entity.  AMC, Regal and Cinemark and their affiliates are referred to in this document as  founding members .  NCM LLC operates the largest digital in-theatre network in North America, allowing NCM LLC to sell advertising (the  Services ) under long-term exhibitor services agreements ( ESAs ) with the founding members (approximately 20 years remaining as of September 29, 2016) and certain third-party theatre circuits (known as  network affiliates ) under long-term network affiliate agreements, which have terms from three to twenty years. 
 As of September 29, 2016, NCM LLC had 137,174,139 common membership units outstanding, of which 59,853,806 (43.6%) were owned by NCM, Inc., 27,072,701 (19.8%) were owned by Regal, 26,384,644 (19.2%) were owned by Cinemark and 23,862,988 (17.4%) were owned by AMC. The membership units held by the founding members are exchangeable into NCM, Inc. common stock on a one-for-one basis. 
 On May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) to merge with Screenvision, LLC ( Screenvision ).  On November 3, 2014, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger.  On March 16, 2015, the Company announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed.  After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members.  On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. During the nine months ended October 1, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million incurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the nine months ended October 1, 2015). The Company and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the merger termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The Company has prepared the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes of NCM, Inc. in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures typically included in an annual report have been condensed or omitted for this quarterly report.  The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the audited financial statements of NCM, Inc.  Therefore, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
 In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made.  The Company s business is seasonal and for this and other reasons operating results for interim periods may not be indicative of the Company s full year results or future performance. As a result of the various related party agreements discussed in Note 4  Related Party Transactions , the operating results as presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might have occurred if all agreements were with non-related third parties.  The Company manages its business under one reportable segment of advertising.

 (UNAUDITED) 
   
    Estimates   The   preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financi  al statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include those related to the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, share-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could d  iffer from those estimates.  
 Significant Accounting Policies 
 The Company s annual financial statements included in its Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 contain a complete discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies. Following is additional information related to the Company s accounting policies. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers   Bad debts are provided for using the allowance for doubtful accounts method based on historical experience and management s evaluation of outstanding receivables at the end of the period. Receivables are written off when management determines amounts are uncollectible. Trade accounts receivable are uncollateralized and represent a large number of geographically dispersed debtors. The collectability risk with respect to national and regional advertising is reduced by transacting with founding members or large, national advertising agencies who have strong reputations in the advertising industry and clients with stable financial positions. The Company has smaller contracts with thousands of local clients that are not individually significant.  As of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no advertising agency groups or individual customers through which the Company sources national advertising revenue representing more than 10% of the Company s outstanding gross receivable balance.  During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, there were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of revenue.  
   
 Share-Based Compensation  The Company has issued stock options and restricted stock to certain employees and restricted stock units to its independent directors. The Company has not granted stock options since 2012.  In 2015 and 2016, the restricted stock grants for Company officers vest upon the achievement of Company performance measures and/or service conditions, while non-officer grants vest only upon the achievement of service conditions.  Compensation expense of restricted stock that vests upon the achievement of Company performance measures is based on management s financial projections and the probability of achieving the projections, which require considerable judgment. A cumulative adjustment is recorded to share-based compensation expense in periods that management changes its estimate of the number of shares of restricted stock expected to vest. Ultimately, the Company adjusts the expense recognized to reflect the actual vested shares following the resolution of the performance conditions. Dividends are accrued when declared on unvested restricted stock that is expected to vest and are only paid with respect to shares that actually vest.  During the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, 15,492, 4,378, 909,322 and 258,839 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested, respectively.  During the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, 7,078, 4,135, 30,528 and 94,540 stock options were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $12.86, $12.06, $12.98 and $12.18 per share, respectively.  
 Consolidation  NCM, Inc. consolidates the accounts of NCM LLC under the provisions of ASC 810,   Consolidation   ( ASC 810 ).  The following table presents the changes in NCM, Inc. s equity resulting from net income attributable to NCM, Inc. and transfers to or from noncontrolling interests (in millions):

    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-01,  Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items  ( ASU 2015-01 ) on a prospective basis, which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP.  Under ASU 2015-01, reporting entities will no longer be required to assess whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, however, presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently are retained, and are expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 did not have a material impact on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ) on a prospective basis.  ASU 2015-02 amends current consolidation guidance by modifying the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ) on a retrospective basis, which provides guidance for simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs.  ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums.  The Company also adopted  Accounting Standards Update 2015-15,   Interest   Imputation of Interest   ( ASU 2015-15 ) on a retrospective basis,     which states the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company reclassified net deferred financing costs related to the Company s Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of those borrowings, while net deferred financing costs related to the Company s Revolving Credit Facility remained an asset in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Upon adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, net deferred financing costs of $10.6 million in the December 31, 2015 unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet were reclassified from an asset to a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt. 
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted  Accounting Standards Update  2015-05,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ) on a prospective basis , which provides guidance on accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The adoption   of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto.   
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ) on a retrospective basis. ASU 2015-17 requires the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position, which is a change from the Company s historical presentation whereby certain of its deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-17, current deferred tax assets of $6.2 million and current deferred tax liabilities of $0.5 million in the December 31, 2015 unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet were reclassified as non-current.

    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition. The new revenue recognition standard requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Accounting Standards Update 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  which was issued in August 2015, revised the effective date for this standard to annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, but not earlier than the original effective date of annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, for public entities. Accounting Standards Update 2016-11,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting,  which was issued in May 2016, rescinds several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services. Accounting Standards Update 2016-12,  Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which was issued in May 2016, provides guidance to reduce the risk of diversity in practice for certain aspects of ASU 2014-09, including collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition. ASU 2014-09 allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto, as well as, which transition method it intends to use. 
 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ), which requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in earnings (rather than reported through other comprehensive income) and updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies and should be adopted on a prospective basis.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01 on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07,  Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  ( ASU 2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted and is to be adopted on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
    In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit   Losses on Financial Statements   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation acco  unt that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, inclu  ding interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted and is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on the unaudited Condensed Consolidat  ed Financial Statements or notes thereto.  
   
 In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
 The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto. 
   
 2.  INCOME PER SHARE 
 Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of potentially dilutive common stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.  The components of basic and diluted loss per NCM, Inc. share are as follows: 

The effect of 77,320,333, 71,704,494, 76,920,803 and 71,110,836 exchangeable NCM LLC common units held by the founding members for the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares and earnings per NCM, Inc. share as they were antidilutive.  NCM LLC common units do not participate in NCM, Inc. dividends.  In addition, there were 11,801, 10,293, 26,387 and 50,021 stock options and non-vested (restricted) shares for the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, respectively, excluded from the calculation as they were antidilutive.

    3.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
 In accordance with NCM LLC s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with its founding members, on an annual basis NCM LLC determines the amount of common membership units to be issued to or returned by the founding members based on theatre additions or dispositions during the previous year.  During the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, NCM LLC issued 1,416,515 and 2,160,915 common membership units to its founding members, respectively, for the rights to exclusive access to the theatre screens and attendees added, net of dispositions by the founding members to NCM LLC s network during the previous year.  NCM LLC recorded a net intangible asset of $21.1 million and $31.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and April 2, 2015, respectively, as a result of the Common Unit Adjustments. 
 In addition, NCM LLC s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement requires that a Common Unit Adjustment occur for a specific founding member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent Common Unit Adjustment, results in an attendance increase or decrease in excess of two percent of the annual total attendance at the prior adjustment date.  If an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider is in place with respect to any acquired theatres, the founding members may elect to receive common membership units related to those encumbered theatres in connection with the Common Unit Adjustment.  If the founding members make this election, then they are required to make payments on a quarterly basis in arrears in accordance with certain run-out provisions pursuant to the ESAs ( integration payments ). During the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, the Company recorded a reduction to net intangible assets of $0.7 million, $0.7 million, $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, related to integration payments due from AMC and Cinemark related to their acquisitions of theatres from Rave Cinemas that are encumbered by an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider.  During the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, AMC and Cinemark paid a total of $0.7 million, $0.8 million, $1.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in integration payments. 
 The Company s intangible assets with its founding members are recorded at the fair market value of NCM, Inc. s publicly traded stock as of the date on which the common membership units were issued.  The NCM LLC common membership units are fully convertible into NCM, Inc. s common stock. In addition, the Company records intangible assets for up-front fees paid to network affiliates upon commencement of a network affiliate agreement. The Company s intangible assets have a finite useful life and the Company amortizes the assets over the remaining useful life corresponding with the ESAs or the term of the network affiliate agreement.  If common membership units are issued to a founding member for newly acquired theatres that are subject to an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider, the amortization of the intangible asset commences after the existing agreement expires and NCM LLC can utilize the theatres for all of its services.  Integration payments are calculated based upon the advertising cash flow that the Company would have generated if it had exclusive access to sell advertising in the theatres with pre-existing advertising agreements. 

4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 Founding Member Transactions  In connection with NCM, Inc. s initial public offering ( IPO ), the Company entered into several agreements to define and regulate the relationships among NCM, Inc., NCM LLC and the founding members. They include the following:

On March 16, 2015, the Company announced the termination of the Merger Agreement with Screenvision.  After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members.  On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. During the nine months ended October 1, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million incurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the nine months ended October 1, 2015). The Company and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement in place since the completion of the Company s IPO, NCM LLC is required to make mandatory distributions on a proportionate basis to its members of available cash, as defined in the NCM LLC Operating Agreement, on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Mandatory distributions of available cash for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 were as follows (in millions):

 (UNAUDITED) 
   
    Due to the merger termination fee and related merger expenses, the mandatory distributions of available cash by NCM LLC to its founding members and NCM, Inc. for the three months   ended April 2, 2015 was calculated as negative $25.5 million ($14.0 million for the founding members and $11.5 million for NCM, Inc.).  Therefore, there was   no   payment made in the second quarter of 2015.  Under the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement  , this negative amount was netted against the available cash distributions for the second quarter of 2016.  The mandatory distributions of available cash by NCM LLC to its founding members for the three months ended September 29, 2016 of $  25.3   million is i  ncluded in amounts due to founding members on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 29, 2016 and will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The distributions to NCM, Inc. are eliminated in consolidation.   
 Amounts due to founding members as of September 29, 2016 were comprised of the following (in millions): 

Amounts due to founding members as of December 31, 2015 were comprised of the following (in millions): 

AC JV, LLC Transactions  In December 2013, NCM LLC sold its Fathom Events business to a newly formed limited liability company, AC JV, LLC, owned 32% by each of the founding members and 4% by NCM LLC.  The Company accounts for its investment in AC JV, LLC under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323-30,   Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures   ( ASC 323-30 ) because AC JV, LLC is a limited liability company with the characteristics of a limited partnership and ASC 323-30 requires the use of equity method accounting unless the Company s interest is so minor that it would have virtually no influence over partnership operating and financial policies.  Although NCM LLC does not have a representative on AC JV, LLC s Board of Directors or any voting, consent or blocking rights with respect to the governance or operations of AC JV, LLC, the Company concluded that its interest was more than minor under the accounting guidance.   The Company s investment in AC JV, LLC was $1.2 million and $1.2 million as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.        
 Related Party Affiliates  NCM LLC enters into network affiliate agreements with network affiliates for NCM LLC to provide in-theatre advertising at theatre locations that are owned by companies that are affiliates of certain of the founding members or directors of NCM, Inc.  Related party affiliate agreements are entered into at terms that are similar to those of the Company s other network affiliates.    
 NCM LLC has an agreement with LA Live, an affiliate of The Anschutz Corporation.  The Anschutz Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Anschutz Company, which is the controlling stockholder of Regal.  During the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, there was approximately $0.1 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, included in advertising operating costs related to LA Live, and there was approximately $0.1 million and $0.1 million of accounts payable with this company as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 Other Transactions  NCM LLC had an agreement with an interactive media company to sell some of its online inventory.  One of NCM, Inc. s directors is also a director of this media company. There was approximately $0.0 million and $0.3 million of accounts receivable due from this company as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

 The following table summarizes NCM LLC s total outstanding debt as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the significant terms of its borrowing arrangements (in millions): 

(1)   
 
  The interest rates on the revolving credit facility and term loans are described below.

In addition, there are no borrower distribution restrictions as long as NCM LLC s consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is below 6.5 times and NCM LLC is in compliance with its debt covenants.  As of September 29, 2016, NCM LLC s consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio was 3.1 times (versus the covenant of 6.5 times).

As a result of the redemption, NCM LLC wrote-off approximately   $2.5 million in unamortized debt issuance costs and paid a redemption premium of approximately $7.9 million, which are reflected in the loss on early retirement of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and nine months end  ed September 29, 2016.       
 Senior Secured Notes due 2022  On July 27, 2012, NCM LLC completed a private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Secured Notes (the  Notes due 2022 ) for which the registered exchange offering was completed on November 26, 2012.  The Notes due 2022 pay interest semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, which commenced October 15, 2012.  The Notes due 2022 are senior secured obligations of NCM LLC, rank the same as NCM LLC s senior secured credit facility, subject to certain exceptions, and share in the same collateral that secures NCM LLC s obligations under the senior secured credit facility.   
 NCM LLC may redeem all or any portion of the Notes due 2022 prior to April 15, 2017, at once or over time, at 100% of the principal amount plus the applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

The Notes due 2026 will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of any subsidiaries that NCM LLC may form or acquire in the future, unless those subsidiaries become guarantors of the Notes due 2026.  NCM LLC does not currently have any subsidiaries, and the Notes due 2026 will not be guaranteed by any subsidiaries that NCM LLC may form or acquire in the future except in very limited circumstances.

    The indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict NCM LLC s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries, if any, to: (1) i  ncur additional debt; (2) make distributions or make certain other restricted payments; (3) make investments; (4) incur liens; (5) sell assets or merge with or into other companies; and (6) enter into transactions with affiliates. All of these restrictive   covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In particular, NCM LLC has the ability to distribute all of its quarterly available cash as a restricted payment or as an investment, if it meets a minimum net senior secured lev  erage ratio. NCM LLC was in compliance with these non-maintenance covenants as of September 29, 2016.   
 On October 3, 2016, NCM LLC filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ), pursuant to which NCM LLC offered to exchange the Notes due 2026 for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that do not contain terms restricting the transfer thereof or providing for registration rights.  The registration statement was declared effective by the Commission on October 11, 2016.  After the exchange offer expires on November 8, 2016, all of the original Notes due 2026 will be exchanged. 
   
 6.  INCOME TAXES 
 The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states.  The Company has established a contingency reserve for material, known tax exposures.  The Company s reserve reflects management s judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement.  While the Company believes its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve.  With respect to the reserve, the Company  income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from the Company s tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.  Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and could impact operating cash flows. 
 Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the amounts otherwise recognized in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $1.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively, excluding accrued interest and penalties, which if recognized would affect the effective tax rate.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and records the liability in income taxes payable in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company recognized $0.0 million, $0.0 million, $0.1 million and $0.0 million interest and penalties during the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 and the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, respectively.    The Company has accrued $0.4 million and $1.0 million for the payment of interest and penalties as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 During the three months ended September 29, 2016, the Company reversed approximately $2.9 million of its contingency reserve ($2.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $0.6 million of accrued interest and penalties) because the statute of limitations expired.  It is reasonably possible that the Company s total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $1.3 million during the next twelve months due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.   
   
 7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 Legal Actions  The Company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes such claims will not have a material effect individually and in the aggregate on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

    Minimum Revenue Guarantees   As part of the network affiliate agreements entered into in   the ordinary course of business under which the Company sells advertising for display in various network affiliate theatre chains, the Company has agreed to certain minimum revenue guarantees on a per attendee basis. If a network affiliate achieves the att  endance set forth in their respective agreement, the Company has guaranteed minimum revenue for the network affiliate per attendee if such amount paid under the revenue share arrangement is less than its guaranteed amount.  The amount and term varies for e  ach network affiliate, but terms range from three to twenty years, prior to any renewal periods of which some are at the option of the Company.  As of September 29, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make   pursuant to the minimum revenue guarantees is $40.2 million over the remaining terms of the network affiliate agreements, which calculation does not include any potential future extensions.  As of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had   no liabilities recorded for these obligations, as such guarantees are less than the expected share of revenue paid to the network affiliate.  

8.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
 Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
 Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  
 Level 3  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  
 Non-Recurring Measurements  Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These assets include long-lived assets, intangible assets, cost and equity method investments, notes receivable and borrowings.  
 Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Other Investments and Notes Receivable  The Company regularly reviews long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), intangible assets, investments accounted for under the cost or equity method and notes receivable for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.    
 Other investments consisted of the following (in millions): 

(1)   
 
  Refer to Note 4  Related Party Transactions .     

(2)   
 
  The Company received equity securities in privately held companies as consideration for a portion of advertising contracts. The equity securities were accounted for under the cost method and represent an ownership of less than 20%. The Company does not exert significant influence on these companies  operating or financial activities.

    During the nine months ended September 29, 2016, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $0.7 million on one of its investments which brought the inve  stment to a remaining value of $0.0 million.  The fair value of the other investments has not been estimated as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as there were no identified events or changes in the circumstances that had a significant adverse ef  fect on the fair value of those investments and it is not practicable to do so because the equity securities are not in publicly traded companies.  As the inputs to the determination of fair value are based upon non-identical assets and use significant uno  bservable inputs, they have been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  
 As of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had notes receivable totaling $16.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively, from its founding members related to the sale of Fathom Events, as described in Note 4  Related Party Transactions . These notes were initially valued using comparative market multiples.  There were no identified events or changes in circumstances that had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the notes receivable.  The notes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the inputs to the determination of fair value are based upon non-identical assets and use significant unobservable inputs. 
 Borrowings  The carrying amount of the revolving credit facility is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value due to its floating-rate terms. The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments where carrying values do not approximate fair value were as follows (in millions):  

(1)   
 
  The Company has estimated the fair value on an average of at least two non-binding broker quotes and the Company s analysis. If the Company were to measure the borrowings in the above table at fair value on the balance sheet they would be classified as Level 2.     

 Recurring Measurements  The fair values of the Company s assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis pursuant to ASC 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   are as follows (in millions):

        Cash Equivalents   The Company s cash equivalents are carried at estimated fair value.  Cash equivalents consist of money market accounts which the Company has classified as Level 1 giv  en the active market for these accounts and commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less, which are classified as Level 2 and are valued as described below.     

(2)   
 
   Short-Term and Long-Term Marketable Securities  The carrying amount and fair value of the marketable securities are equivalent since the Company accounts for these instruments at fair value. The Company s government agency bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit are valued using third party broker quotes. The value of the Company s government agency bonds is derived from quoted market information. The inputs in the valuation are generally classified as Level 1 given the active market for these securities; however, if an active market does not exist, the inputs are recorded at a lower level in the fair value hierarchy. The value of commercial paper and certificates of deposit is derived from pricing models using inputs based upon market information, including contractual terms, market prices and yield curves. The inputs to the valuation pricing models are observable in the market, and as such are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015, there was an inconsequential amount of net realized gains (losses) recognized in interest income and an inconsequential amount of net unrealized holding gains (losses) included in other comprehensive income.  Original cost of short-term marketable securities is based on the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer.     

 The amortized cost basis, aggregate fair value and maturities of the marketable securities the Company held as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

9.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
 During 2012, NCM LLC terminated interest rate swap agreements that were used to hedge its interest rate risk associated with its term loan.  Following the termination of the swap agreements, the variable interest rate on NCM LLC s $270.0 million term loan is unhedged and as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any outstanding derivative assets or liabilities. A portion of the breakage fees paid to terminate the swap agreements was for swaps in which the underlying debt remained outstanding.  The balance in AOCI related to these swaps was fixed and was amortized into earnings over the remaining period during which interest payments were hedged, or February 13, 2015.  The Company considered the guidance in ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging  which states that amounts in AOCI shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  As of September 29, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding related to these discontinued cash flow hedges. 
 The changes in AOCI by component for the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 were as follows (in millions):

Item 2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 Some of the information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), as amended.  All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, certain statements under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , may constitute forward-looking statements.  In some cases, you can identify these  forward-looking statements  by the specific words, including but not limited to  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential  or  continue  or the negative of those words and other comparable words.  These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.  Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain factors as more fully discussed under the heading  Risk Factors  contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included herein and the audited financial statements and other disclosure included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. In the following discussion and analysis, the term net income refers to net income attributable to NCM, Inc. 
 Overview 
 NCM LLC operates the largest digital in-theatre video advertising network in North America, through which it distributes national and local advertising that the Company has sold on theatre screens and video screens in theatre lobbies.  NCM LLC also sells theatre lobby promotions and online and mobile advertising that are displayed on its and other company websites and mobile sites and apps. Our revenue is principally derived from advertising distributed to NCM LLC s founding member theatres in accordance with long-term ESAs (approximately 20 years remaining as of September 29, 2016) and to network affiliates in accordance with multi-year agreements, which expire at various dates through July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 18.4   years as of September 29, 2016. The ESAs with the founding members and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theatres to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our advertising  FirstLook  pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is generated by theatres connected to our DCN (the remaining 375 screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the  FirstLook  pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors). 
 Management focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings at least once per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed below, as some of our primary measurement metrics.  In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local and regional advertising pricing (CPM), local and regional advertising rate per screen per week and local and regional and total advertising revenue per attendee. We also monitor free cash flow, the dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA), cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors. 
 On May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into the Merger Agreement to merge with Screenvision, which was terminated on March 16, 2015. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed, or paid on behalf of, NCM, Inc. for certain expenses, including an approximate $26.8 million termination payment to Screenvision pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members.  During the nine months ended October 1, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million incurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the nine months ended October 1, 2015). The Company and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred. 
   
 23 

Our operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K   filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016 for the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ( OIBDA ), Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States.  OIBDA represents operating income before depreciation and amortization expense.  Adjusted OIBDA excludes from OIBDA non-cash share based compensation costs, the merger termination fee and related merger costs and Chief Executive Officer transition costs.  Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures.  The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share based compensation programs, levels of mergers and acquisitions, CEO turnover, interest rates, debt levels or income tax rates. A limitation of these measures, however, is that they exclude depreciation and amortization, which represent a proxy for the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company s business. In addition, Adjusted OIBDA has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company s share based payment costs, costs associated with the terminated merger with Screenvision, or costs associated with the resignation of the Company s former Chief Executive Officer. OIBDA or Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in the Company s debt agreement. 
 The following table reconciles operating income to OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA for the periods presented (dollars in millions): 

(1)   
 
  Share-based compensation costs are included in network operations, selling and marketing and administrative expense in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     

(2)   
 
  Merger termination fee and related merger costs primarily include the merger termination payment and legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated merger with Screenvision.     

(3)    
 
  Chief Executive Officer transition costs represent severance, consulting and other costs.     

25 

The Company has also presented total operating expenses before the merger termination fee and related merger costs within its results of operations section   below   which is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the Unit  ed States.  Operating expenses before the merger termination fee and related merger costs represent operating costs less costs associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.  This non-GAAP financial measure is used to provide readers a comparison of o  ur 2016 results to our 2015 results without including the impact of the nonrecurring merger termination fee and related merger costs.  The Company believes this is an important supplemental measure because it eliminates these nonrecurring costs to highligh  t trends in its ongoing business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures.  Operating expenses before the merger termination fee and related merger costs should not be regarded as an alternative to operating expense  s or as an indicator of operating performance, nor should it be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that total operating expenses is the most directly comparable GAAP   financial measure.  
 Basis of Presentation 
 The results of operations data for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 was derived from the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting records of NCM, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto. 
 Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 
 Revenue.  Total revenue increased 1.6%, from $111.7 million for the three months ended October 1, 2015 to $113.5 million for the three months ended September 29, 2016.  The following is a summary of revenue by category (in millions):  

The following table shows data on theatre attendance and revenue per attendee for the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015: 

(1)   
 
  Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC s advertising network, excluding screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theatres that are currently part of another cinema advertising network for all periods presented.     

26 

Nati  onal advertising revenue.   The $3.0 million, or 3.8%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from NCM LLC s founding members) was due primarily to a 2.1% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) in the third q  uarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015 and a $1.5 million increase in online, mobile and other revenue not included in the inventory measured by impressions sold or CPMs.  The increase in national advertising CPMs was due primarily to higher   CPMs on upfront commitments and the scatter market in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. These increases to revenue were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in impressions sold, which resulted in a decrease in national inven  tory utilization, from 145.8% for the third quarter of 2015 to 132.5% for the third quarter of 2016 on a 9.4% increase in network attendance.  Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is ba  sed on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate.    
  Local and regional advertising revenue.  The $2.3 million, or 8.8%, decrease in local and regional advertising revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000, whereby they had a 27.3% decrease in contract volume and an 18.6% decrease in average contract value in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000 was driven by the absence of two contracts that were greater than $1 million in the third quarter of 2015.  This was partially offset by revenue from contracts less than $100,000 which increased 1.9% in average contract value and increased 1.7% in contract volume primarily related to expansion of our salesforce and diversification of our client base. 
  Founding member beverage revenue.  The $1.1 million, or 17.2%, increase in national advertising revenue from NCM LLC s founding members  beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a 9.8% increase in founding member attendance and a 5.7% increase in beverage revenue CPMs in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The 2016 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the  FirstLook  pre-show from 2014 to 2015, which increased 5.7%.  
 Operating expenses.  Total operating expenses increased $1.2 million, or 1.9%, from $63.9 million for the three months ended October 1, 2015 to $65.1 million for the three months ended September 29, 2016.  The following table shows the changes in operating expense for the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 (in millions):  

Advertising operating costs.  Advertising operating costs decreased $0.3 million, or 3.8%, from $7.8 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in production costs, personnel related expenses and contract labor.   
  Network costs.  Network costs decreased $0.2 million, or 4.7%, from $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $4.1   million for the third quarter of 2016. 
  Theatre access fees founding members.  Theatre access fees increased $1.6 million, or 9.1%, from $17.6 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $19.2 million for the third quarter of 2016.  The increase was due to a $1.0 million increase in the fee associated with founding member attendance and a $0.6 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. The theatre access fees, based upon attendance increased $1.0 million due to a 9.8% increase in founding member attendance during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The $0.6 million increase in digital screen fees increased $0.4 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $0.2 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment.   
   
 27 

Selling and marketing costs.   Selling and marketing costs decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, from $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $16  .8 million for the third quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in personnel related expenses related primarily to lower bonus expense, partially offset by a   $0.2 million increase in online publisher expense related   to higher online and mobile revenue during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015 and a $0.2 million increase in marketing research expense  .    
  Administrative and other costs.  Administrative and other costs decreased $0.7 million, or 7.5%, from $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $8.6 million for the third quarter of 2016 due primarily to a $0.9 million decrease in personnel related expenses related primarily to lower bonus expense, partially offset by $0.2 million of CEO transition costs.   
  Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.9 million, or 11.3%, from $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2016. The increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related primarily to NCM LLC founding member common unit adjustments, partially offset by lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated. 
 Non-operating expenses.   Total non-operating expenses increased $11.8 million, or 72.7%, from $16.1 million for the three months ended October 1, 2015 to $27.8 million for the three months ended September 29, 2016.  The following table shows the changes in non-operating expense for the three months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 (in millions):  

The increase in non-operating expense was due primarily to a $10.4 million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the redemption of our senior unsecured notes due 2021. The loss on early retirement of debt included an approximate $7.9 million redemption premium and the write-off of approximately $2.5 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. Interest on borrowings increased approximately $1.3 million during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to the one-month period between the issuance of the Notes due 2026 in August 2016 and the redemption of the Notes due 2021 in September 2016, whereby interest was paid on both notes for one month. 
 Net Income . Net income increased $0.5 million from $7.7 million for the three months ended October 1, 2015 to $8.2 million for the three months ended September 29, 2016. The increase in net income was due to an increase in operating income of $0.6 million, as described above, a $5.7 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests  related to lower pre-tax income and a decrease in income tax expense of $5.9 million due primarily to a $2.9 million reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions as the statute of limitations expired during the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million in non-operating expense, as described further above.  
   
 28 

Nine Months Ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015  
 Revenue . Total revenue decreased 1.6%, from $310.1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2015 to $305.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2016.  The following is a summary of revenue by category (in millions):  

The following table shows data on theatre attendance and revenue per attendee for the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015: 

(1)   
 
  Represents the total attendance Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC s advertising network, excluding screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theatres for all periods presented.     

  National advertising revenue.  The $2.7 million, or 1.2%, decrease in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from NCM LLC s founding members) was due primarily to a 9.7% decrease in impressions sold in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015, partially offset by a 5.4% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) and a $8.0 million increase in online, mobile and other revenue not included in the inventory measured by impressions sold or CPMs.  The decrease in impressions sold was due primarily to lower content partner spending which declined approximately $5.8 million during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in impressions sold resulted in a decrease in national inventory utilization, from 127.0% for the first nine months of 2015 to 112.9% for the first nine months of 2016 on a 1.3% increase in network attendance.  Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate.  The increase in national advertising CPMs was due primarily to higher CPMs on upfront commitments in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015.   
  Local and regional advertising revenue.  The $1.1 million, or 1.6%, decrease in local and regional advertising revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000, whereby they had a 2.4% decrease in contract volume and a 12.4% decrease in average contract value in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000 was driven by fewer contracts that were greater than $1 million.  This was partially offset by revenue from contracts less than $100,000 which increased 6.8% in contract volume primarily related to expansion of our salesforce and diversification of our client base. 
  Founding member beverage revenue.  The $1.2 million, or 5.2%, decrease in national advertising revenue from NCM LLC s founding members  beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a decrease of $3.0 million related to one of NCM LLC s founding members reducing the length of its beverage advertising unit by 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in beverage revenue CPMs and a 2.2% increase in founding member attendance during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015.  The 2016 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPMs during segment one of the  FirstLook  pre-show from 2014 to 2015, which increased 5.7%.

Operating expenses.   Total operating expenses decreased $19.2 million, or 8.6%, from $223.6 mill  ion for the nine months ended October 1, 2015 to $204.4 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2016.  The following table shows the changes in operating expense for the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 (in millions):  

Advertising operating costs.  Advertising operating costs decreased $1.1 million, or 5.0%, from $21.9 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $20.8 million for the first nine months of 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of a $0.8 million decrease in affiliate advertising payments due to a 5.8%, or 211 screens, decrease in the number of average affiliate screens during the period primarily related to an acquisition of a network affiliate by a founding member in late 2015, whereby we are now paying theatre access fees. 
  Network costs.  Network costs decreased $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from $13.0 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $12.9 million for the first nine months of 2016. 
  Theatre access fees founding members.  Theatre access fees increased $2.8 million, or 5.2%, from $54.0 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $56.8 million for the first nine months of 2016.  The increase was due to a $2.1 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment and a $0.7 million increase in the fee associated with founding member attendance. The $2.1 million increase in digital screen fees increased $1.1 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $1.0 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment. Theatre access fees based on attendance increased $0.7 million due to a 2.2% increase in founding member attendance during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015.  
  Selling and marketing costs.  Selling and marketing costs increased $4.6 million, or 9.2%, from $49.9 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $54.5 million for the first nine months of 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher salaries and non-cash share-based compensation expense.  Selling and marketing costs also increased due to a $0.9 million increase in online publisher expense related to higher online and mobile revenue, a $0.9 million increase in marketing research and event merchandising expenses and $0.7 million due to a non-cash impairment charge on an investment obtained in exchange for advertising services. 
  Administrative and other costs.  Administrative and other costs increased $6.6 million, or 25.1%, from $26.3 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $32.9 million for the first nine months of 2016 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in non-cash share-based compensation expense related primarily to expense associated with modifying equity awards pursuant to agreements with our former CEO and $3.4 million of CEO transition costs, which consisted primarily of severance and consulting costs to our former CEO. 
  Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.3 million, or 9.5%, from $24.2 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $26.5 million for the first nine months of 2016. The increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related primarily to NCM LLC founding member common unit adjustments, partially offset by lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated. 
    Merger termination fee and related merger costs.  The merger termination fee and related merger costs were $34.3 million for the first nine months of 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and  
   
 30 

approximately $7.5 million in primarily legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.  
 Non-operating expenses.   Total non-operating expenses increased $10.5 million, or 20.9%, from $50.2 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2015 to $60.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2016.  The following table shows the changes in non-operating expense for the nine months ended September 29, 2016 and October 1, 2015 (in millions):  

The increase in non-operating expense was due primarily to a $10.4 million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the redemption of our senior unsecured notes due in 2021. The loss on early retirement of debt included an approximate $7.9 million redemption premium and the write-off of approximately $2.5 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. The interest on borrowings increased approximately $2.0 million during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to the one-month period between the issuance of the Notes due 2026 in August 2016 and the redemption of the Notes due 2021 in September 2016, whereby interest was paid on both notes for one month, as well as, a higher LIBOR rate on our term loans during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015. These increases in non-operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the amortization of terminated derivatives as the amortization period ended in February 2015.   
 Net Income . Net income increased $1.9 million from $8.8 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2015 to $10.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2016. The increase in net income was due to an increase in operating income of $14.2 million, as described above, and a decrease of $5.0 million in income tax expense due primarily to a $2.9 million reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions as the statute of limitations expired in the period, partially offset by an increase of $10.5 million in non-operating expense, as described above, and a $6.8 million increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Known Trends and Uncertainties  
 Trends and Uncertainties Related to our Business, Industry and Corporate Structure 
 Changes in the current macro-economic environment and changes in the national, regional and local advertising markets present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, including the timing and amount of spending from our advertising clients.  These changes include increased competition related to the expansion of online and mobile advertising platforms.  Further, we could be negatively impacted by factors that could reduce the viewership of our  FirstLook  pre-show, such as the offering of reserve seating, an increase in the number and length of trailers for upcoming films and lower network attendance, which could result from shortening of release windows, more alternative methods of delivering movies to consumers, lower consumer confidence and disposable income and a decline in the motion picture box office. The impact to our business associated with these issues could be mitigated over time due to factors including the increase in salable advertising impressions, better geographic coverage related to the expansion of our network, diversification and growth of our advertising client base, improvements in  FirstLook  pre-show engagement and upgrades to our inventory management and data management systems. We could also benefit if the effectiveness of cinema advertising improves relative to other advertising mediums. Consumer and media market trends appear to have had a favorable impact on our level of national upfront bookings for 2015 and 2016 when compared to the previous year. We believe that over time, a shift toward more upfront commitments, would allow us to bundle several client flights throughout the year in an effort to stabilize month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter volatility. Consistent with the television industry upfront booking practices, a portion of our upfront commitments have cancellation options or options to reduce the amount that advertisers may purchase and we would need to rely on the scatter market to replace those commitments.  
 The change in the number of screens in our network during the nine months ended September 29, 2016 was as follows. 

(1)   
 
  During the first nine months of 2016, the run-out provision in the contract with one of our affiliates that was acquired by a theatre circuit not in our network ended, resulting in 194     screens being removed from our network. These lost screens were partially offset by three new affiliates with 153 screens added during the first nine months of 2016.      

 We believe that adding screens and attendees to our network will provide our advertising clients with a better marketing product with increased reach and improved geographic coverage.  We have begun to offer our advertising clients better audience targeting capabilities and more robust campaign data analytics that we believe will provide a better product offering and should expand our overall national client base.  We also believe that the continued growth of our market coverage could strengthen our selling proposition and competitive positioning against other national, regional and local video advertising platforms, including television, online and mobile video platforms and other out of home video advertising platforms. 
 In 2014, we experienced a decline of 16.4%, in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue) compared to the prior year due primarily to the increased competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, television networks and other out-of-home video networks and the implementation of more aggressive seasonal and volume pricing strategies that contributed to the expansion of our inventory utilization related to the addition of new client categories that traditionally buy their television advertising at lower CPMs.  After adjusting our pricing through 2014 to be more attractive to a broader number of potential clients, to compete more effectively with various forms of premium video advertising and reflect seasonal marketplace supply and demand characteristics, during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, we experienced an increase year over year of 6.7% and 5.4%, respectively, in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue).  We have also experienced volatility in our utilization over the years, with annual national inventory utilization ranging from 98.8% to 128.3% over the last four years.  We experience even more substantial volatility quarter-to-quarter.  This volatility in utilization can be driven by the loss or addition of one or more significant national contracts, whereby the timing and amount of these national contracts can be based upon the advertising budgets of our customers, product launches, the financial performance of our customers or other industry or macro-economic factors.  We expect our CPMs and utilization to continue to be impacted period to period based upon the factors described above.

Under the ESAs, up t  o 90 seconds of the   FirstLook   program can be sold to NCM LLC s founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements. During the first six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to NCM LLC s founding   members. Beginning July 1, 2015, one of NCM LLC s founding members reduced their beverage advertising from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. We have the right to sell the remaining 30 second unit to other clients. The other founding members  current long-term con  tracts with their beverage suppliers require 60 seconds of beverage advertising, although such commitments could change in the future. Should the amount of time acquired as part of these beverage concessionaire agreements decline with the other founding me  mbers, this premium time will be available for sale to other clients. Per the ESAs, the time sold to the founding member beverage supplier is priced equal to the advertising CPM for the previous year charged by NCM LLC to unaffiliated third parties during   segment one (closest to showtime) of the   FirstLook   pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC.  Due to a 5.7% increase in segment one CPMs in 2015, the CPM on our beverage concessionaire revenue increased during the firs  t nine months of 2016 by 5.7% and the remainder of 2016 will increase by an equivalent percentage.  
 In consideration for NCM LLC s access to NCM LLC s founding members  theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of lobbies and other space within NCM LLC s founding members  theatres for the LEN and lobby promotions, NCM LLC s founding members receive a monthly theatre access fee under the ESAs. The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron and a fixed payment per digital screen (connected to the DCN). The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the next increase taking effect for fiscal year 2017, and the payment per digital screen increases annually by 5%. The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to all founding members cannot be less than 12% of NCM LLC s aggregate advertising revenue (as defined in the ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment. Pursuant to the ESAs, the theatre access fee paid to the members of NCM LLC included an additional fee for access to the higher quality digital cinema systems. This additional fee will continue to increase as additional screens are equipped with the new digital cinema equipment and the fee increases annually by 5%. As of September 29, 2016, 95% of our founding member network screens were showing advertising on digital cinema projectors, and thus the future impact on the theatre access fee related to additional digital cinema installations within existing founding member theatres is expected to be minimal. 
 During 2015, we reduced the length of our content partner entertainment programming segments from two and one-half minutes to two minutes in content partner agreements representing about 50% of our  FirstLook  pre-show impressions.  During 2016, we are reducing the remaining segments such that all of our content partner agreements will provide for two-minute entertainment content segments.  The reduction in the length of our  FirstLook  content partner entertainment segments from two and one-half minutes to two minutes provided two additional 30-second national units and one additional local or regional advertising unit for us to sell across approximately 50% of our network impressions in 2015 and will provide for these additional segments across 100% of our network impressions in 2016.  Because there is no reduction in our revenue from reducing these content segments, this will provide additional salable national, local and regional  FirstLook  pre-show inventory that could allow us to increase our future advertising revenue provided that there is adequate market demand. 
 Trends and Uncertainties Related to Liquidity and Financial Performance 
 During the past several years, we amended our senior secured credit facility to extend the maturity, expand the revolver availability and reduce the interest rate spreads.  In August 2016, we completed a private placement of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2026. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our $200.0 million 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2021. The remaining proceeds, after the payment of fees and the redemption premium were used to pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility.  As a result of these financing transactions on our revolving credit facility and senior notes, we extended the average maturities of our debt and as of September 29, 2016 the weighted average remaining maturity was 6.0 years.  As of September 29, 2016, approximately 70% of our total borrowings bear interest at fixed rates.  The remaining 30% of our borrowings bear interest at variable rates and as such, our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate with market interest rate fluctuations that could increase the interest paid on our borrowings. Refer to Note 5  Borrowings  to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Company s borrowings. 
   
 33 

At times our cash flow available for the payment of divi  dends (NCM LLC s Adjusted OIBDA, less capital expenditures, interest expense, distributions to NCM LLC s founding members, income taxes, tax receivable agreement payments to NCM LLC s founding members and plus certain cash items) has been less than our reg  ular dividend payment.  Any deficit has been funded by NCM, Inc. s cash and marketable securities balances.  As of September 29, 2016, these cash and marketable securities balances totaled $52.6 million (excluding NCM LLC). We intend to pay a regular quart  erly dividend for the foreseeable future at the discretion of the Board of Directors consistent with our intention to distribute over time a substantial portion of our free cash flow.  The declaration, payment, timing and amount of any future dividends pay  able will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors who will take into account general economic and advertising market business conditions, the Company s financial condition, available cash, current and anticipated cash needs, and any other facto  rs that the Board of Directors considers relevant.  
 Trends Related to Ownership in NCM LLC 
 In accordance with NCM LLC s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with its founding members, on an annual basis NCM LLC determines the amount of common membership units to be issued to or returned by the founding members based on theatre additions or dispositions during the previous year.  During the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, NCM LLC issued 1,416,515 and 2,160,915 common membership units to its founding members, respectively, for the rights to exclusive access to the theatre screens and attendees added, net of dispositions by the founding members to NCM LLC s network during the previous year.  NCM LLC recorded a net intangible asset of $21.1 million and $31.4 million during the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of the Common Unit Adjustments. 
 Overall, NCM, Inc. s ownership in NCM LLC decreased to 43.6% as of September 29, 2016 compared to 43.8% at December 31, 2015 due primarily to the common unit adjustment described above, which has proportionally increased net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and decreased net income attributable to NCM, Inc. 
 In July 2016, AMC entered into an amended and restated merger agreement with a large motion picture exhibitor, Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ( Carmike ) pursuant to which AMC would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Carmike. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by Carmike s shareholders. As of June 30, 2016, Carmike held membership units representing approximately 18% of the total issued and outstanding membership units of another cinema advertising provider and Carmike has a long-term agreement with the cinema advertising provider for them to be their exclusive provider of on-screen advertising services.   
 If the merger closes, then the on-screen advertising agreement with the alternative provider may or may not remain in effect with respect to the acquired Carmike theatres.  Under either circumstance, AMC may  elect to receive NCM LLC common membership units related to the acquisition of those theatres. If AMC makes this election and the on-screen cinema advertising agreement with the alternative provider remains in effect then, AMC will be required to make integration payments, as described in Note 3     Intangible Assets   to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  If this were to occur, we believe that, the effect on NCM, Inc. s cash position would be relatively neutral in the near term as the integration payments would increase available cash distributions from NCM, LLC and approximately offset the impact of lower NCM, Inc. ownership in NCM LLC.  Further, we believe, it would have the effect of reducing NCM, Inc. s net income and earnings per share (without consideration of any tax expense implications) due to the higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests.   
 Further, pursuant to NCM, Inc. s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and NCM LLC s Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement, as amended, members of NCM LLC, other than NCM, Inc., may choose to have common membership units redeemed, and NCM, Inc. may elect to redeem through either a cash payment or the issuance of shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis.  If AMC were to redeem its common membership units for NCM, Inc. common stock, NCM, Inc. s ownership would increase proportionally and the number of shares outstanding of NCM, Inc. common stock would increase.  As this merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by Carmike s shareholders, there is no certainty that the merger will close or what the ultimate outcome and impact on NCM LLC or NCM, Inc. will be.

Financial Condition and Liquidity  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash balances can fluctuate due to the seasonality of our business and related timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments, as well as available cash payments (as defined in the NCM LLC Operating Agreement) to NCM LLC s founding members, interest or principal payments on our term loan and the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes, income tax payments, tax receivable agreement payments to NCM LLC s founding members and amount of quarterly dividends to NCM, Inc. s common stockholders (including special dividends). 
 A summary of our financial liquidity is as follows (in millions):  

(1)   
 
  Included in cash and cash equivalents as of September 29, 2016, December 31, 2015 and October 1, 2015, was $1.4     million, $3.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively, of cash held by NCM LLC that is not available to satisfy NCM, Inc. s dividend, income tax, tax receivable payments to NCM LLC s founding members and other obligations.     

(2)   
 
  The revolving credit facility portion of NCM LLC s total borrowings is available, subject to certain conditions, for general corporate purposes of NCM LLC in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the senior secured credit facility, and a portion is available for letters of credit. NCM LLC s total capacity under the revolving credit facility was $175.0 million as of September 29, 2016 and $135.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and October 1, 2015.     

 We have generated and used cash as follows (in millions): 

Operating Activities.   The $29.0 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2016, compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the change in accounts receivable of $25.2 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2016 compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2015 related to higher collections and an $8.7 million increase in consolidated net income, as described further above, partially offset by a $6.3 million higher payment to NCM LLC s founding members under the tax receivable agreement.     

Investing Activities.   The $4.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2016, compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2015 was due primarily to lower proceeds of marketable securities, net of purchases, of approximately $3.4 million.     

Financing Activities.   The $60.4 million increase in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2016, compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2015 was due primarily to higher repayments, net of proceeds, under our revolving credit facility of $107.0 million, partially offset by $42.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes due 2026, net of the redemption of the Notes due 2021.          

 Sources of Capital and Capital Requirements. 
 NCM, Inc. s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is the quarterly available cash distributions from NCM LLC as well as its existing cash balances and marketable securities, which as of September 29, 2016 were $52.6 million (excluding NCM LLC).  NCM LLC s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are its cash provided by operating activities, availability under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand. 
   
 35 

Management   believes that future funds generated from NCM LLC s operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, NCM LLC s debt service requirements, and capital expenditure and other investing requirements, through the next twel  ve months. Cash flows generated by NCM LLC s distributions to NCM, Inc. and the founding members can be impacted by the seasonality of advertising sales, stock option exercises, interest on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and to a lesser ex  tent theatre attendance. NCM LLC is required pursuant to the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement to distribute its available cash, as defined in the operating agreement, quarterly to its members (NCM LLC s founding members and NCM, Inc.).   The availabl  e cash distribution to the members of NCM LLC for the nine months ended September 29, 2016, net of the negative available cash generated in the first quarter of 2015 and netted against the second quarter of 2016 distribution, was approximately $61.8 millio  n, of which approximately $26.6 million was distributed to NCM, Inc.    NCM, Inc. expects to use cash received from future available cash distributions and its cash balances to fund income taxes, payments associated with the tax receivable agreement with NCM   LLC s founding members and current and future dividends as declared by the Board of Directors, including a dividend declared on November 3, 2016 of $0.22 per share (approximately $13.2     million) on each share of the Company s common stock (not including ou  tstanding restricted stock) to stockholders of record on November 18, 2016 to be paid on December 2, 2016. Distributions from NCM LLC and NCM, Inc. cash balances should be sufficient to fund payments associated with the tax receivable agreement with NCM LL  C s founding members, income taxes and its regular dividend for the foreseeable future at the discretion of the Board of Directors dependent on anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, future prospects for earnings, available cash and cash flow  s, as well as other relevant factors.  
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 For a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and understanding of our results of operations, and that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, see Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  contained in our annual report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and incorporated by reference herein.  As of September 29, 2016, there were no significant changes in those critical accounting policies. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the information provided under Note 1  The Company  to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 For a discussion of related party transactions, see the information provided under Note 4  Related Party Transactions  to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Our operating lease obligations, which primarily include office leases, are not reflected on our balance sheet.  See Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Contractual and Other Obligations  contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and incorporated by reference herein.  We do not believe these arrangements are material to our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures. 
 Contractual and Other Obligations 
 There were no material changes to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 29, 2016. 
   
 36 

Seasonality  
 Our revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature, coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and to a lesser extent the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry. Both advertising expenditures and theatre attendance tend to be higher during the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters. Advertising revenue is primarily correlated with new product releases, advertising client marketing priorities and economic cycles and to a lesser extent theatre attendance levels. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending on these factors or other risks and uncertainties. Based on our historical experience, our first quarter typically has less revenue than the other quarters of a given year due primarily to lower advertising client demand and lower theatre industry attendance levels. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future. 
 The following table reflects the quarterly percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. 

The following table reflects the quarterly percentage of total advertising revenue for the fiscal years ended 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk.  The Notes due 2022 and the Notes due 2026 are at fixed rates, and therefore are not subject to market risk.  As of September 29, 2016, the only interest rate risk that we are exposed to is related to our $175.0 million revolving credit facility and our $270.0 million term loan.  A 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates underlying our term loan and revolving credit facility would have the effect of increasing or decreasing our cash interest expense by approximately $2.7 million for an annual period on the $3.0 million revolving credit balance and $270.0 million term loan outstanding as of September 29, 2016.  For a discussion of market risks, see Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and incorporated by reference herein. 
   Item 4.     Controls and Procedures  
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of September 29, 2016, our management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 29, 2016 were effective. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 29, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
