NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The significant accounting policies used by Enterprise Financial Services Corp (the "Company" or "Enterprise") in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are summarized below: 
    
  Business and Consolidation 
    
  Enterprise is a financial holding company that provides a full range of banking and wealth management services to individuals and corporate customers located in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Phoenix metropolitan markets through its banking subsidiary, Enterprise Bank   Trust (the "Bank"). 
    
  Operating results for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the year ending December 31,   2016  .  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  In 2016, the Company changed its presentation of certificates of deposit on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to separate brokered deposit sources from other sources.  The corresponding prior period balances were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 
  
    6 

NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per common share data is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common shares outstanding include common stock and restricted stock awards where recipients have satisfied the vesting terms. Diluted earnings per common share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  
    
  The following table presents a summary of per common share data and amounts for the periods indicated. 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount of common stock equivalents excluded from the earnings per share calculations because their effect was anti-dilutive was   zero  , and   0.1 million   common stock equivalents, respectively.  
  
    7 

NOTE 3 - INVESTMENTS 
    
  The following table presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of securities available for sale and held to maturity: 

At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer in an amount greater than   10%   of shareholders  equity, other than U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises. The agency mortgage-backed securities are all issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. Available for sale securities having a fair value of   $321.5 million   and   $334.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure deposits of public institutions and for other purposes as required by law or contract provisions. 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The weighted average life of the mortgage-backed securities is approximately   4   years.

The following table represents a summary of investment securities that had an unrealized loss: 

The unrealized losses at both   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates since the securities were purchased. Management systematically evaluates investment securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis. This analysis requires management to consider various factors, which include among other considerations (1) the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected compared to the amortized cost of the security, (2) duration and magnitude of the decline in value, (3) the financial condition of the issuer or issuers, (4) structure of the security, and (5) the intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not the Company would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in market value.  At   September 30, 2016  , management performed its quarterly analysis of all securities with an unrealized loss and concluded no individual securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
   The gross gains and gross losses realized from sales of available for sale investment securities were as follows:

The restructured loans resulted from deferral of principal and extending the term to maturity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1.2   million specific reserves allocated to loans that have been restructured.  There were   no   Portfolio loans restructured that subsequently defaulted during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  The aging of the recorded investment in past due Portfolio loans by portfolio class and category at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is shown below. 

13 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, payment experience, credit documentation, and current economic factors among other factors. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
             
    Grades   1  ,   2  , and   3       Includes loans to borrowers with a continuous record of strong earnings, sound balance sheet condition and capitalization, ample liquidity with solid cash flow, and whose management team has experience and depth within their industry. 
                
    Grade   4       Includes loans to borrowers with positive trends in profitability, satisfactory capitalization and balance sheet condition, and sufficient liquidity and cash flow. 
                
    Grade   5       Includes loans to borrowers that may display fluctuating trends in sales, profitability, capitalization, liquidity, and cash flow. 
                
    Grade   6       Includes loans to borrowers where an adverse change or perceived weakness has occurred, but may be correctable in the near future. Alternatively, this rating category may also include circumstances where the borrower is starting to reverse a negative trend or condition, or has recently been upgraded from a   7  ,   8  , or   9   rating. 
                
    Grade   7     Watch   credits are borrowers that have experienced financial setback of a nature that is not determined to be severe or influence  ongoing concern  expectations.  Although possible, no loss is anticipated, due to strong collateral and/or guarantor support. 
                
    Grade   8       Substandard   credits will include those borrowers characterized by significant losses and sustained downward trends in balance sheet condition, liquidity, and cash flow. Repayment reliance may have shifted to secondary sources. Collateral exposure may exist and additional reserves may be warranted. 
                
    Grade   9       Doubtful   credits include borrowers that may show deteriorating trends that are unlikely to be corrected. Collateral values may appear insufficient for full recovery, therefore requiring a partial charge-off, or debt renegotiation with the borrower. The borrower may have declared bankruptcy or bankruptcy is likely in the near term. All doubtful rated credits will be on non-accrual. 
       
  The recorded investment by risk category of the Portfolio loans by portfolio class and category at   September 30, 2016  , which is based upon the most recent analysis performed, and   December 31, 2015   is as follows:

NOTE 5 - PURCHASED CREDIT IMPAIRED ("PCI") LOANS 
    
  Below is a summary of PCI loans by category at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The aging of the recorded investment in past due PCI loans by portfolio class and category at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is shown below: 

16 

The following table is a rollforward of PCI loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the estimated life of the acquired loans using the effective yield method.  Outstanding customer balances on PCI loans were   $64.6 million   and   $98.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  

17 

NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Company issues financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of the business of meeting the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The Company s extent of involvement and maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. 
    
  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for financial instruments included on its consolidated balance sheets.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $0.5 million   unadvanced commitments on impaired loans.  
    
  The contractual amounts of off-balance-sheet financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments usually have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, may have significant usage restrictions, and may require payment of a fee. Of the total commitments to extend credit at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $108 million   and   $94 million  , respectively, represent fixed rate loan commitments. Since certain of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon or may be revoked, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, premises and equipment, and real estate.  Other liabilities include   $0.3   million for estimated losses attributable to the unadvanced commitments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance or payment of a customer to a third party. These standby letters of credit are issued to support contractual obligations of the Company s customers. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the risk involved in extending loans to customers. The approximate remaining term of standby letters of credit range from   1 month to 5 years   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Contingencies 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings arising out of their businesses.  Management believes there are no such proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries which, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

18 

NOTE 7 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The Company is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients and as part of its risk management activities.  These instruments include interest rate swaps and option contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
    
  Risk Management Instruments.   The Company enters into interest rate caps in order to economically hedge changes in fair value of State tax credits held for sale.  See Note 8   Fair Value Measurements for further discussion on the fair value of state tax credits.  The notional amount of the derivative instruments used to manage risk was   $3.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the fair value was   zero   in both periods. 
    
  Client-Related Derivative Instruments.   The Company enters into interest rate swaps to allow customers to hedge changes in fair value of certain loans while maintaining a variable rate loan on its own books.  The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with clients, and enters into offsetting foreign exchange forward contracts with established financial institution counterparties.  The table below summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of the client-related derivative instruments: 

Changes in the fair value of client-related derivative instruments are recognized currently in operations.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the gains and losses offset each other due to the Company's hedging of the client swaps with other bank counterparties. 

NOTE 8 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Below is a description of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 
    
  The following table summarizes financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value: 

19 

Securities available for sale  . Securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level   2   and Level   3   inputs.  Fair values for Level 2 securities are based upon dealer quotes, market spreads, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond's terms and conditions at the security level. At   September 30, 2016  , Level   3   securities available for sale consist primarily of   three   Auction Rate Securities that are valued based on the securities' estimated cash flows, yields of comparable securities, and live trading levels.  
                
    State tax credits held for sale.   At   September 30, 2016  , of the   $44.2 million   of state tax credits held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, approximately   $4.8 million   were carried at fair value. The remaining   $39.4 million   of state tax credits were accounted for at cost. 
     The Company is not aware of an active market that exists for the   10  -year streams of state tax credit financial instruments.  However, the Company s principal market for these tax credits consists of Missouri state residents  
  
    20 

who buy these credits and local and regional accounting firms who broker them. As such, the Company employed a discounted cash flow analysis (income approach) to determine the fair value. 
  The fair value measurement is calculated using an internal valuation model with market data including discounted cash flows based upon the terms and conditions of the tax credits. If the underlying project remains in compliance with the various federal and state rules governing the tax credit program, each project will generate about   10   years of tax credits. The inputs to the discounted cash flow calculation include: the amount of tax credits generated each year, the anticipated sale price of the tax credit, the timing of the sale and a discount rate. The discount rate is estimated using the LIBOR swap curve at a point equal to the remaining life in years of credits plus a   205   basis point spread. With the exception of the discount rate, the other inputs to the fair value calculation are observable and readily available. The discount rate is considered a Level 3 input because it is an  unobservable input  and is based on the Company s assumptions. An increase in the discount rate utilized would generally result in a lower estimated fair value of the tax credits.  Alternatively, a decrease in the discount rate utilized would generally result in a higher estimated fair value of the tax credits.  Given the significance of this input to the fair value calculation, the state tax credit assets are reported as Level   3   assets. 
             
    Derivatives  . Derivatives are reported at fair value utilizing Level   2   inputs. The Company obtains counterparty quotations to value its interest rate swaps and caps. In addition, the Company validates the counterparty quotations with third party valuation sources. Derivatives with negative fair values are included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Derivatives with positive fair value are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
     Level 3 financial instruments 
    
  The following table presents the changes in Level   3   financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

21 

From time to time, the Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or fair value that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period.  The following table presents financial instruments and non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(1) The amounts represent only balances measured at fair value during the period and still held as of the reporting date. 
    
  Impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. Fair values for impaired loans are obtained from current appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers or independent valuation specialists. Other real estate owned is adjusted to fair value upon foreclosure of the underlying loan. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Fair value of other real estate is based upon the current appraised values of the properties as determined by qualified licensed appraisers and the Company s judgment of other relevant market conditions. Certain state tax credits are reported at cost. 
    
  Following is a summary of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

NOTE 9 - NEW AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
    
  FASB ASU 2016-15 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments"   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)" which addresses changes to reduce the presentation diversity of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees.   The guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning afte  r December 15, 2017, in  cluding interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The new standard will be applied retrospectively, but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable.     The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated statement of cash flows. 
    
  FASB ASU 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments (Topic 326)" which changes the methodology for evaluating impairment of most financial instruments. The ASU replaces the currently used incurred loss model with a forward-looking expected loss model, which will generally result in a more timely recognition of losses.  The guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements. 
    
  FASB ASU 2016-09 "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting"   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic  
  
    24 

718)" which impacts accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized in the income statement as income tax expense (or benefit.)  The tax effects of exercised or vested awards must be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period.  Excess tax benefits will be classified with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity, and cash paid by an employer when withholding shares for tax liabilities should be classified as a financing activity.  The guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements. 
    
  FASB ASU 2016-02 "Leases (Topic 842)"   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" which requires organizations that lease assets ("lessees") to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms of more than 12 months.  The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee remains dependent on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The criteria for determining whether a lease is a finance or operating lease has not been significantly changed by this ASU.  The ASU also requires additional disclosure of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements.  The guidance becomes effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption will be permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  FASB ASU 2016-01 "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"   In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value through earnings, and eliminates the available-for-sale classification for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk must be recognized in other comprehensive income. When measuring the fair value of financial instruments at amortized cost, the exit price must be used for disclosure purposes. The ASU also requires that financial assets and liabilities be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements. 
    
  FASB ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the new guidance, an entity will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The new guidance was originally effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of this guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies, and permits early adoption on a limited basis.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements, nor decided upon the method of adoption. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach of adoption.

NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
  On October 10, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Jefferson County Bancshares, Inc. ( JCB ).  JCB and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Bank and Trust Company of Missouri, have approximately $935 million in assets, $670 million in loans, and $763 million in deposits as of June 30, 2016.  JCB operates 13 full service retail and commercial banking offices in metropolitan St. Louis and Perry County, Missouri.           
  JCB shareholders will receive, based on their election, cash consideration in an amount of $85.39 per share of JCB common stock or 2.75 shares of EFSC common stock per share of JCB common stock.  Aggregate consideration at the closing will be 3.3 million shares of EFSC common stock and approximately $26.6 million in cash, subject to adjustment for any JCB stock option exercises.  Based on EFSC s 15-day volume weighted average closing stock price of $31.52 as of October 10, 2016, the overall transaction has an estimated value of $130.6 million, including JCB s common stock and stock options. 
    
  The transaction is anticipated to close in early 2017, and is subject to normal and customary closing conditions, including but not limited to, regulatory approval and approval by JCB shareholders.

  Introduction 
    
  The following discussion describes the significant changes to the financial condition of the Company that have occurred during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the financial condition as of   December 31, 2015  .  In addition, this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and cash flows of the Company for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  .  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

27 

Executive Summary 
    
  Below are highlights of our financial performance for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the linked quarter ended   June 30, 2016  , and prior year quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . 

Below are highlights of the Company's Core performance measures, which we believe are important measures of financial performance, but are non-GAAP measures.  Core performance measures include contractual interest on PCI loans, but exclude incremental accretion on these loans, and exclude the Change in the FDIC receivable, Gain or loss  
  
    28 

on the sale of other real estate from PCI loans, and expenses directly related to PCI loans and other assets formerly covered under FDIC loss share agreements.  Core performance measures also exclude certain other income and expense items, such as executive separation costs, merger related expenses, and the gain or loss on sale of investment securities, the Company believes to be not indicative of or useful to measure the Company's operating performance on an ongoing basis.  A reconciliation of Core performance measures has been included in this MD A section under the caption "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures". 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company noted the following trends: 

The Company reported net income of   $35.2 million  , or   $1.74   per share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $27.8 million  , or   $1.37   per share, for the same period in 2015.  The   27%   increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in core net income from growing net interest income and an increase in noninterest income, as well as a more substantial contribution from PCI assets due to the termination of FDIC loss share. 

On a core basis   1   , net income was   $29.3 million  , or   $1.45   per share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $23.7 million  , or   $1.17   per share, in the prior year period.  The increase from the prior year was primarily due to increases in earning asset balances, driving growth in core net interest income.  

Net interest income for the first   nine   months of   2016     increased     $11.7 million   or   13%  , from the prior year period due to strong portfolio loan growth. 

Net interest margin for the first   nine   months of   2016   expanded   three   basis points to   3.87%   when compared to the prior year period.  Core net interest margin   1   , for the first   nine   months of   2016  , defined as Net interest margin (fully tax equivalent), including contractual interest on PCI loans, but excluding the incremental accretion on these loans, increased   nine   basis points from the prior year period primarily due to managed reductions in funding costs combined with an improved earning asset mix, and an increase in the yield on portfolio loans. 

29 

Noninterest income for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased   $5.9 million  , or   42%  , compared to the prior year period largely due to a decrease in the Change in FDIC receivable from termination of the Company's loss share agreements in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Core noninterest income   1    increased   $0.4 million  , or   2%  , from the prior year period primarily due to higher fee income from service charges on deposits and card products, and an increase in the gain on sale of mortgages. 

Noninterest expense increased   $3.6 million  , or   6%  , from the prior year period, due to an increase in Employee compensation and benefits, while the Company's efficiency ratio improved to   52.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   57.9%   in the prior year.  Core noninterest expense   1    also increased   6%   when compared to the prior year.  However, the Core efficiency ratio   1    also improved to   55.4%   from   58.9%   when compared to the prior year period due to revenue growth resulting from investments in customer facing associates driving continued revenue growth. 
       
  Other highlights: 

On October 10, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Jefferson County Bancshares, Inc. ("JCB") headquartered in Jefferson County, Missouri.  JCB is the parent holding company of Eagle Bank and Trust Company of Missouri.  The transaction is anticipated to close in early 2017, and is subject to normal and customary closing conditions, including but not limited to, regulatory approval and approval by JCB shareholders.  The merger with JCB is expected to accelerate the Company's St. Louis market expansion and add valuable scale and operating leverage to this market.  The Company believes that JCB's commercial and retail customer bases are complementary to EFSC's existing product sets.  

The Company repurchased 6,700 shares at $26.50 per share pursuant to its publicly announced program during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , 18,918 shares at $26.46 per share during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and 160,100 shares at $26.30 per share during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The Company's Board authorized the repurchase plan in May of 2015, which allows the Company to repurchase up to two million common shares, representing approximately 10% of the Company s currently outstanding shares.  Shares may be bought back in open market or privately negotiated transactions over an indeterminate time period based on market and business conditions.   
       
  Balance sheet highlights:   
    
     Provision for portfolio loan losses was   $4.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  See Item 1, Note 4   Portfolio Loans, and Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses in this section for more information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Interest Income 
  Average Balance Sheet 
  The following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as, the corresponding interest rates earned and paid, all on a tax equivalent basis. 

(1) 
    Average balances include non-accrual loans.  Loan fees, net of amortization of deferred loan origination fees and costs, included in interest income are approximately   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively. 
      
    31 

(1) 
    Average balances include non-accrual loans.  Loan fees, net of amortization of deferred loan origination fees and costs, included in interest income are approximately   $1.6 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively. 
        
  Rate/Volume  
  The following table sets forth, on a tax-equivalent basis for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in yield/rates and volume. 

32 

Net interest income (on a tax equivalent basis) was   $34.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $30.4 million   for the same period of   2015  ,   an increase   of   $3.8 million  , or   13%  .  Total interest income   increased     $4.1 million   and total interest expense   increased     $0.3 million  .  The tax-equivalent net interest margin was   3.80%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   3.93%   for the   second   quarter of   2016  , and   3.77%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , and combined with portfolio loan growth, supported the   $4.1 million   increase in interest income.  The yield on taxable portfolio loans increased   10   basis points from the prior year period to   4.23%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase was due to an increase in yields on variable rate loans, aided by the Federal Reserve's raise in the targeted Fed Funds rate of 25 basis points, to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, in December 2015.  The run-off of higher yielding PCI loans continues to negatively impact net interest margin leading to a   $1.8 million     decrease   in interest income due to volume for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Net interest income was   $101.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $89.6 million   for the same period of   2015  ,   an increase   of   $11.8 million  , or   13%  . Total interest income   increased     $12.2 million   and total interest expense   increased     $0.4 million  . The tax-equivalent net interest margin was   3.87%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.84%   for the same period of   2015  .  The yield on taxable portfolio loans increased   six   basis points from the prior year period to   4.18%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Core net interest margin   1    was   3.53%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.44%   for the prior year period, an increase of   nine   basis points primarily due to loan growth improving the earning asset mix, lower funding costs, and the aforementioned increase in the yield on portfolio loans.  These factors have been partially offset  
  
    33 

by reductions in PCI loan balances and the higher contractual rates associated with these loans.  The Company continues to manage its balance sheet to grow core net interest income and expects to maintain core net interest margin over the coming quarters; however, pressure on funding costs and continued reductions in PCI loan balances could negate the expected trends in core net interest margin. 
    
  Purchased Credit Impaired "PCI" Contribution 
  The following table illustrates the non-core contribution of PCI loans and related assets for the periods indicated. 

Accelerated cash flows and other incremental accretion consists of the interest income on PCI loans in excess of contractual interest on the loans.  The contractual amount of interest is included in the Company's core results.  At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining accretable yield on the portfolio was estimated to be   $16 million   and the non-accretable difference was approximately   $21 million  .  Accelerated cash flows and other incremental accretion from PCI loans was   $8.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   $9.4 million   for the same period in 2015.  The Company estimates 2016 income from accelerated cash flows and other incremental accretion to be between   $10 million   and   $12 million  . 
  
    34 

Noninterest Income 
    
  The following table presents a comparative summary of the major components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. 

Noninterest income   increased     $5.9 million  , or   42%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of 2015, largely from the impact of the Company's termination of FDIC loss share agreements in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Core noninterest income   1      grew     2%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts, gain on sale of mortgages, and fee income from card products, when compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . 

35 

Noninterest Expense 
    
  The following table presents a comparative summary of the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 

Noninterest expenses were     $62.9 million     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to     $59.3 million     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015  .      The increase was primarily due to an increase in Employee compensation and benefits from investments in revenue producing personnel.      Core noninterest expenses   1      increased     $3.7 million     to     $61.1 million     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , from     $57.4 million     for the prior year  
  
    36 

period.  The increase was largely due to an increase in Employee compensation and benefits from the addition of     client service personnel to facilitate growth. 
    
  The Company's Core efficiency ratio   1    declined to   55.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   58.9%   for the prior year, and reflects overall expense management and revenue growth trends.  Core efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure.  A reconciliation of Core efficiency ratio has been included in this MD A section under the caption "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures". 
    
  The Company anticipates total noninterest expenses to be between   $19.5 million   and   $21.5 million   for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Income Taxes 
    
  The Company's income tax expense for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which includes both federal and state taxes, was   $6.3 million   and   $18.9 million  , respectively, compared to   $4.7 million   and   $14.5 million  , respectively, for the same periods of   2015  .  The combined federal and state effective income tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   35.0%  , and was   34.3%   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in the effective tax rate over the prior year period was caused by higher pre-tax income lessening the impact of permanent differences, and a state tax benefit from refunds received for prior years.  

Summary Balance Sheet 

Assets 
    
  Loans by Type 
    
  The Company has a diversified loan portfolio, with no particular concentration of credit in any one economic sector; however, a substantial portion of the portfolio is secured by real estate, including loans classified as C I loans.  The ability of the Company's borrowers to honor their contractual obligations is partially dependent upon the local economy and its effect on the real estate market.  The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's loan portfolio: 

37 

Portfolio loans grew by     $287.0 million  , to     $3.0 billion     at     September 30, 2016  , when compared to     December 31, 2015  .  PCI loans totaled     $47.4 million     at     September 30, 2016  , a decrease of     $27.3 million  , or   37%  , from   December 31, 2015  , primarily as a result of principal paydowns and accelerated loan payoffs. 
    
  The following table illustrates portfolio loan growth with selected specialized lending detail: 

Specialized lending products, especially Enterprise value lending, Life insurance premium financing, and Tax credits, consist of primarily C I loans, and have contributed significantly to the Company's loan growth. These loans are sourced through relationships developed with estate planning firms and private equity funds, and are not bound geographically by our traditional three markets. These specialized loan products offer opportunities to expand and diversify geographically by entering into new markets. The Company continues to focus on originating high-quality C I relationships as they typically have variable interest rates and allow for cross selling opportunities involving other banking products. C I loan growth also supports our efforts to maintain the Company's asset sensitive interest rate risk position.  The Company expects continued loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, and loan growth, excluding the acquisition of JCB, at or above   10%   for 2017. 

38 

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off, by loan category, and additions to the allowance charged to expense. 

The provision for loan losses on portfolio loans for the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016     was   $4.6 million  , compared to   $4.3 million   for the comparable   2015   period.  The provision for loan losses for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   is reflective of growth in the portfolio as well as reflecting additional reserves on loans evaluated individually for impairment.   

39 

For PCI loans, the Company remeasures contractual and expected cash flows periodically.  When the remeasurement process results in a decrease in expected cash flows, typically due to an increase in expected credit losses, impairment is recorded through provision for loan losses.  Similarly, when expected credit losses decrease in the remeasurement process, prior recorded impairment is reversed before the yield is increased prospectively.  There was   $1.6 million   of provision reversal for loan losses on PCI loans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to provision reversal of   $3.5 million   for the comparable   2015   period. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses on portfolio loans was   1.23%   of portfolio loans at   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.24%   at   September 30, 2015  .  Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.  The reduction in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans over the prior year period is due to continued strong credit performance, and the low level of charge-off activity during the year, which also results in continued improvement in loss migration results. 

Nonperforming assets 
    
  The following table presents the categories of nonperforming assets and other ratios as of the dates indicated. 

40 

Nonperforming loans    
  Nonperforming loans exclude PCI loans that are accounted for on a pool basis, as the pools are considered to be performing.  See Item 1, Note 5   Purchased Credit Impaired Loans for more information on these loans. 
    
  Nonperforming loans based on loan type were as follows: 

The following table summarizes the changes in nonperforming loans: 

Nonperforming loans at   September 30, 2016   increased by   $10.8 million  , or   119%  , when compared to   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the addition of one   $10.8 million   relationship in the C I portfolio.  
    
  Other real estate 
  Other real estate at   September 30, 2016  , was   $3.0 million  , compared to   $8.4 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in Other real estate: 

Writedowns in fair value are recorded in Loan legal and other real estate expense based on current market activity shown in the appraisals.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company realized a net gain of   $0.6 million   from the sales of other real estate, primarily from the sale of properties related to PCI loans, and recorded these gains as part of Noninterest income.  

41 

Liabilities 
    
  Liabilities totaled   $3.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in liabilities was largely due to a   $340 million   increase in total deposits, offset by a decrease of   $80 million   in other borrowings.  
    
  Deposits 

Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   were   $3.1 billion  , an increase of   $340 million  , or   12%  , from   December 31, 2015  .  Growth in core deposits, defined as total deposits excluding time deposits, was strong at   $208.6 million  , or   9%  , supporting robust loan growth and was augmented by an increase in brokered certificates of deposit.  The composition of our noninterest bearing deposits remained relatively stable at   24%   of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  Lower rates on time deposit balances and a change in composition improved deposit costs by   three   basis points during the first   nine   months of   2016   to   0.36%  , as compared to   0.39%   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Shareholders' Equity 
    
  Shareholders' equity totaled   $381 million   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $30.3 million   from   December 31, 2015  .  Significant activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was as follows: 

Other comprehensive income of   $4.5 million   from the change in unrealized gains on investment securities, 
                 
    Dividends paid on common shares of   $6.0 million  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet our commitments as they become due.  Typical demands on liquidity are run-off from demand deposits, maturing time deposits which are not renewed, and fundings under credit commitments to customers.  Funds are available from a number of sources, such as from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities.   
    
  Additionally, liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio, fed fund lines with correspondent banks, borrowings from the Federal Reserve and the FHLB, the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits, and the ability to sell loan participations to other banks.  These alternatives are an important part of our liquidity plan and provide flexibility and efficient execution of the asset-liability management strategy. 
  
    42 

The Bank's Asset-Liability Management Committee oversees our liquidity position, the parameters of which are approved by the Bank's Board of Directors.      Our liquidity position is monitored monthly by producing a liquidity report, which measures the amount of liquid versus non-liquid assets and liabilities.  Our     liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements, such as the loan to deposit ratio, a liquidity ratio, and a dependency ratio.  The Company's liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources.  While core deposits and loan and investment repayments are principal sources of liquidity, funding diversification is another key element of liquidity management and is achieved by strategically varying depositor types, terms, funding markets, and instruments. 
    
  Parent Company liquidity 
  The parent company's liquidity is managed to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt, invest in subsidiaries as necessary, and satisfy other operating requirements.  The parent company's primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends and payments from the Bank and proceeds from the issuance of equity (i.e. stock option exercises, stock offerings).  Another source of funding for the parent company includes the issuance of subordinated debentures and other debt instruments.   
    
  The parent company currently has a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement ("Revolving Agreement") with another bank allowing for borrowings up to   $20 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are no outstanding balances under the Revolving Agreement.  Additionally, the Company received three quarterly dividends from the Bank of   $2.5 million   each as part of the Company's ongoing capital management.  Management believes the current level of cash at the holding company of   $6.2 million  , together with the Company's other available funding sources, will be sufficient to meet projected cash needs for at least the next year. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $56.8 million   of outstanding subordinated debentures as part of   eight   Trust Preferred Securities Pools.  These securities are classified as debt but are included in regulatory capital and the related interest expense is tax-deductible, which makes them an attractive source of funding. 
    
  Bank liquidity 
  The Bank has a variety of funding sources available to increase financial flexibility. In addition to amounts currently borrowed, at   September 30, 2016   the Bank has borrowing capacity of   $293.8 million   from the FHLB of Des Moines under blanket loan pledges, and has an additional   $878.2 million   available from the Federal Reserve Bank under a pledged loan agreement.  The Bank has unsecured federal funds lines with   five   correspondent banks totaling   $60.0 million  .  
    
  Investment securities are another important tool to the Bank's liquidity objectives.  Of the   $479.6 million   of the securities available for sale at   September 30, 2016  ,   $321.5 million   was pledged as collateral for deposits of public institutions, treasury, loan notes, and other requirements.  The remaining   $158.1 million   could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary. 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into certain forms of off-balance sheet transactions, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  These transactions are managed through the Bank's various risk management processes.  Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of the Company's liquidity.  The Bank has   $1.2 billion   in unused commitments as of   September 30, 2016  .  While this commitment level would exhaust the majority the Company's current liquidity resources, the nature of these commitments is such that the likelihood of funding them in the aggregate at any one time is low. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and its    
  
    43 

bank affiliate must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The banking affiliate s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, Tier 1, and Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets.  To be categorized as  well capitalized , banks must maintain minimum total risk-based (10%), Tier 1 risk-based (8%), Common equity tier 1 risk-based (6.5%), and Tier 1 leverage ratios (5%).  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
    
  The Bank continues to exceed regulatory standards and met the definition of  well-capitalized  (the highest category) at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company adopted the Regulatory Capital Framework (Basel III) in 2015, and has implemented the necessary processes and procedures to comply. 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's various capital ratios at the dates indicated: 

The Company believes the tangible common equity ratio and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio are important measures of capital strength even though they are considered to be non-GAAP measures.  The tables further within MD A reconcile these ratios to U.S. GAAP. 
  
    44 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
    
  The Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, the Company provides other financial measures, such as Core net income and net interest margin, and other Core performance measures, regulatory capital ratios, and the tangible common equity ratio, in this report that are considered  non-GAAP financial measures.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
  The Company considers its Core performance measures presented in this report and the included tables as important measures of financial performance, even though they are non-GAAP measures, as they provide supplemental information by which to evaluate the impact of PCI loans and related income and expenses, the impact of certain non-comparable items, and the Company's operating performance on an ongoing basis.  Core performance measures include contractual interest on PCI loans, but exclude incremental accretion on these loans.  Core performance measures also exclude the Change in FDIC receivable, Gain or loss on sale of other real estate from PCI loans, and expenses directly related to PCI loans and other assets formerly covered under FDIC loss share agreements.  Core performance measures also exclude certain other income and expense items, such as executive separation costs, merger related expenses, and the gain or loss on sale of investment securities, the Company believes to be not indicative of or useful to measure the Company's operating performance on an ongoing basis.  The Company believes that the tangible common equity ratio provides useful information to investors about the Company's capital strength even though it is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and is not part of the regulatory capital requirements to which the Company is subject. 
  The Company believes these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance and capital strength. The Company's management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing the Company's operating results and related trends and when forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In the following tables, the Company has provided a reconciliation of, where applicable, the most comparable GAAP financial measures and ratios to the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, or a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The impact and any associated risks related to the Company's critical accounting policies on business operations are described throughout "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.  For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
  
    48 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned  Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  included in Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk    
  Our interest rate risk management practices are aimed at optimizing net interest income, while guarding against deterioration that could be caused by certain interest rate scenarios.  Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  We attempt to maintain interest-earning assets, comprised primarily of both loans and investments, and interest-bearing liabilities, comprised primarily of deposits, maturing or repricing in similar time horizons in order to minimize or eliminate any impact from market interest rate changes.  In order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates, the Company uses an earnings simulation model.  
    
  The Company determines the sensitivity of its short-term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus 100 to 300 basis point parallel rate shock through the use of simulation modeling.  The simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity.  Future business assumptions involving administered rate products, prepayments for future rate-sensitive balances, and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included.  These items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates.  The resulting net interest income for the next 12-month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates.  This difference represents the Company's earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus 100 basis points parallel rate shock. 
    
  The following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income (due to the current level of interest rates, the 200 and 300 basis point downward shock scenarios are not shown): 

The Company occasionally uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset/liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above.  They are used to modify the Company's exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $3.5 million   in notional amount of outstanding interest rate caps, to help manage interest rate risk. 
  
    49 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, as of   September 30, 2016  .  Disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
    
  Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the objectives described above. 
    
  Changes to Internal Controls 
    
  There were no changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, those controls. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings arising out of their businesses.  Management believes there are no such proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries which, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS 
    
  For information regarding risk factors affecting the Company, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in the introduction to Item 2 of Part I of this Report on Form 10-Q, and Part I, Item 1A of our Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in such Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

50 

ITEM 2:  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  The following table provides information on repurchases by the Company of its common stock in each month of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

(a) In May 2015, the Company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company s common stock.  The repurchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions and the repurchase program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated.  The timing and exact amount of common stock repurchases will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic capital and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, and contractual and regulatory limitations.
