  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    
  (in thousands, except share and per share data) 

Note 1. 
    General 
     In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods.  
  The unaudited interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in SJW Corp.'s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Consolidation  which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that the general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, modifies the consolidation analysis for reporting entities that are involved in variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that operate as registered money market funds.  ASU 2015-02 became effective for SJW Corp. in the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      
  Water sales are seasonal in nature and influenced by weather conditions.  The timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water consumption by customers to vary significantly.  Due to the seasonal nature of the water business, the operating results for interim periods are not indicative of the operating results for a 12-month period.  Revenue is generally higher in the warm, dry summer months when water usage and sales are greater, and lower in the winter months when cooler temperatures and increased rainfall curtail water usage and sales. 
  In response to the ongoing drought in California, on November 13, 2015, Governor Edmund Brown Jr. issued Executive Order B-36-15 to bolster the state's drought response.  On November 24, 2015, the Santa Clara Valley Water District ( SCVWD ) extended their call for 30% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering of ornamental landscapes two days a week through June 30, 2016.  On February 2, 2016, the State Water Board adopted an extended and revised emergency regulation to ensure that urban water conservation continues through October 2016.  On May 9, 2016, Governor Brown issued an executive order to build on temporary statewide emergency water restrictions and to establish longer term water conservation measures, including permanent monthly water use reporting, new permanent water use standards in California communities and bans on clearly wasteful practices.  On May 18, 2016, the State Water Board adopted a new approach to water conservation regulation and replaced its prior percentage reduction-based water conservation standard with a new approach designed to ensure at least a three year supply of available water based on local conditions.  On June 14, 2016, the SCVWD reduced its conservation target from   30%   to   20%   and also increased the number of outdoor watering days from two to three effective July 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017.   
  Effective June 15, 2015, San Jose Water Company was authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) to activate Stage 3 of Tariff Rule 14.1 which is a water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges resulting from usage above customer allocations.  Tariff Rule 14.1 focuses primarily on restrictions of outdoor water use which accounts for 50% of a typical customer's water usage.  On June 24, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed with the CPUC to amend its water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges to reflect the SCVWD's changes.  This request was approved by the CPUC with an effective date of July 1, 2016.  The drought surcharges are not recorded as revenue.  Rather, they are recorded in a regulatory liability account which has been authorized by the CPUC to track lost revenues from conservation.  The amount recorded in the surcharge account is being used to offset future rate increases that would otherwise be necessary to recover lost revenue due to drought conservation efforts.  As of   September 30, 2016  , San Jose Water Company has a remaining balance of approximately   $6,320   in the drought surcharge account to offset future rate increases related to drought conservation efforts.  San Jose Water Company is continually working to remain in compliance with the various drought rules and regulations and is also working with local governments as well as the SCVWD to communicate consistent messages to the public about use restrictions and related matters associated with the ongoing drought.   
  Effective March 31, 2014, San Jose Water Company received approval from the CPUC to institute a Mandatory Conservation Revenue Adjustment Memorandum Account.  This account was subsequently replaced with a Water Conservation Memorandum Account ( WCMA ).  The WCMA allows San Jose Water Company to track lost revenue associated with

reduced sales due to the ongoing drought and the associated calls for water use reduction from the SCVWD.  San Jose Water Company records the lost revenue captured in the WCMA regulatory accounts once the revenue recognition requirements of FASB ASU Topic 980 -  Regulated Operations,  subtopic 605-25 are met.  For further discussion, please see Note 8 and Note 9. 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated using income available to common shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is calculated using income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock including both shares outstanding and shares potentially issuable in connection with deferred restricted common stock awards under SJW Corp.'s Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the  Incentive Plan ) and shares potentially issuable under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ).  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   714   and   380   anti-dilutive restricted common stock units were excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation, respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   4,801   and   1,819   anti-dilutive restricted common stock units were excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation, respectively.   
  A portion of depreciation expense is allocated to administrative and general expense.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amounts allocated to administrative and general expense were   $416   and   $400  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amounts allocated to administrative and general expense were   $1,251   and   $1,191  , respectively.  

Note 2. 
    Equity Plans 
     SJW Corp. accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued to employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 -  Compensation - Stock Compensation,  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on the estimated fair value for all share-based payment awards. 
  The Incentive Plan allows SJW Corp. to provide employees, non-employee board members or the board of directors of any parent or subsidiary, consultants, and other independent advisors who provide services to the company or any parent or subsidiary the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in SJW Corp.  The types of awards included in the Incentive Plan are restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance shares, or other share-based awards.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining number of shares available under the Incentive Plan was   993,954  , and an additional   229,972   shares were issuable under outstanding restricted stock units and deferred restricted stock units.  In addition, shares are issued to employees under the company's ESPP.  
  Stock compensation costs charged to income are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  A summary of compensation costs charged to income, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and similar instruments, and the tax benefit realized from stock options and similar instruments exercised, that were recorded to additional paid-in capital and common stock, by award type, are presented below for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  which became effective for SJW Corp. during the first quarter of 2016.  ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs for term debt in the balance sheet by requiring the debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than recorded as an asset.  In August 2015, ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  was issued to provide clarification to ASU 2015-03.  The standard specifies that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  This standard required application on a retrospective basis.  Upon adoption of the standard, SJW Corp. reclassified its debt issuance costs totaling   $3,561   and   $3,638   which was originally included in unamortized debt issuance, broker and reacquisition costs against its long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  There was no impact from adopting the new standard on SJW Corp.'s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Changes in Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  On June 1, 2016, San Jose Water Company entered into a   $125,000   credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the lender (the  Lender ).  The Credit Agreement provides an unsecured credit facility with a letter of credit sublimit of   $10,000  .  Proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used to refinance existing debt, for working capital, and for general corporate purposes.  The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of June 1, 2021. 
  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as certain restrictive covenants customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and investments, restricted payments, asset sales, and fundamental changes.  The Credit Agreement also includes certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a maximum funded debt to capitalization ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. 
  On June 1, 2016, the company entered into a fourth amendment to San Jose Water Company s existing   $85,000   credit agreement, dated as of March 1, 2012, as amended from time to time (the  WF Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ) thereby reducing the maximum principal amount available under such line of credit to   $3,060  .  Pursuant to such amendment, no further borrowing was permitted under the WF Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement remained outstanding for the sole purpose of reimbursing Wells Fargo for any draws against outstanding letters of credit for the California Department of Water Resources' Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund ( SDWSRF ) loans and related fees until such letters of credit were replaced or terminated.  All outstanding borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement were paid off as of   September 30, 2016  .  Under both the Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement total borrowings could not exceed   $125,000  .  On June 29, 2016, San Jose Water Company paid off the SDWSRF loans' remaining balance of   $1,823   which had a maturity date in 2027 and the WF Credit Agreement and letters of credit were terminated on September 27, 2016. 
  On June 1, 2016, SJW Corp. and SJW Land Company (collectively, the  Borrowers ), entered into a   $15,000   credit agreement with the Lender (the  SJW Corp. Credit Agreement ), which provides an unsecured credit facility to the Borrowers with a letter of credit sublimit of   $5,000  .  The SJW Corp. Credit Agreement matures on June 1, 2021.  Borrowings under the SJW Corp. Credit Agreement bear interest under the same terms and conditions as those in the Credit Agreement.  The SJW Corp. Credit Agreement replaced the then outstanding   $15,000   credit agreement, dated March 1, 2012, as amended from time to time, between the Borrowers and Wells Fargo, which was paid off and terminated. 
  In addition, on June 1, 2016, SJW Corp., as guarantor, and SJWTX, Inc. (the  Borrower ), entered into a   $5,000   credit agreement with the Lender (the  SJWTX Credit Agreement ), which provides an unsecured credit facility to the Borrower with a letter of credit sublimit of   $1,000  .  The SJWTX Credit Agreement matures on June 1, 2021.

on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The fair value of such financial instruments are determined using the income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  There have been no changes in valuation technique during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of these instruments would be categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents, which would be categorized as Level 1.  The fair value of pension plan assets is discussed in Note 4.  
  The fair value of SJW Corp.'s long-term debt was approximately   $479,521   and   $500,035   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the current rates for similar financial instruments of the same duration and creditworthiness of the company.  The book value of the long-term debt was $  375,783   and $  380,678   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The fair value of long-term debt would be categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Company's investment in California Water Service Group was   $3,209   and   $6,030  , respectively, and would be categorized as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Note 8. 
    Regulatory Rate Filings 
     Effective September 15, 2016, the Cupertino City Council authorized San Jose Water Company to implement a   8.6%   general rate increase and a 2016 Interim Rate True-Up Surcharge of   $0.1832   per CCF to be collected over a   12  -month period from customers in the Cupertino leased water system San Jose Water Company operates.  The new rates match those previously approved by the CPUC in San Jose Water Company's most recent General Rate Case Decision effective January 1, 2016.  

Note 9. 
    Balancing and Memorandum Account Recovery Procedures 
     San Jose Water Company established balancing accounts for the purpose of tracking the under-collection or over-collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the CPUC to offset those expense changes.  San Jose Water Company also maintains memorandum accounts to track revenue impacts due to catastrophic events, certain unforeseen water quality expenses related to new federal and state water quality standards, energy efficiency, WCMA, drought surcharges, Monterey Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism, and other approved activities or as directed by the CPUC.  Balancing and memorandum accounts are recognized by San Jose Water Company when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.   
  In addition, in the case of special revenue programs such as the WCMA, San Jose Water Company follows the requirements of ASC Topic 980-605-25  Alternative Revenue Programs  in determining revenue recognition, including the requirement that such revenues will be collected within 24 months of the year-end in which the revenue is recorded.  A reserve is recorded for amounts SJW Corp. estimates will not be collected within the 24-month period.  This reserve is based on the difference between authorized usage in the last general rate case decision and an estimate of actual usage over the recovery period, offset by applicable drought surcharges.  In assessing the probability criteria for balancing and memorandum accounts between general rate cases, San Jose Water Company considers evidence that may exist prior to CPUC authorization that would satisfy ASC Topic 980 subtopic 340-25 recognition criteria.  Such evidence may include regulatory rules and decisions, past practices, and other facts and circumstances that would indicate that recovery or refund is probable.  When such evidence provides sufficient support, the balances are recorded in SJW Corp.'s financial statements. 
  Based on ASC Topic 980-605-25, San Jose Water Company recognized regulatory assets of   $5,863   and   $12,624   due to lost revenues accumulated in the 2016 WCMA account for   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  These regulatory assets were offset by a regulatory liability in the amount of   $5,863   and   $12,624   for   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, created by Tariff Rule 14.1 drought surcharges collected during the same period as allowed for in Advice Letter 473A which was approved by the CPUC and became effective June 15, 2015.  These amounts have been recorded in the 2016 WCMA row shown in the tables below. 
  On June 28, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter 492 for a surcharge of   $8,767   to true-up the difference between interim rates and 2015 General Rate Case authorized rates, which is expected to be collected during a 12-month recovery period once approved.  The   $8,767   of revenue was recorded in the 2015 General Rate Case true-up row for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   table below.  This amount includes   $185   related to water supply accounts that have previously been recorded and have been deducted from the appropriate row in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   table below.

SJW Corp. undertakes no obligation to update or revise the information contained in this report, including the forward-looking statements, to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report. 

General: 
  SJW Corp. is a holding company with five subsidiaries:  San Jose Water Company, SJW Land Company, SJWTX, Inc., Texas Water Alliance Limited and SJW Group, Inc. 
  San Jose Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 229,000 connections that serve a population of approximately one million people in an area comprising approximately 138 square miles in the metropolitan San Jose, California area. 
  The principal business of San Jose Water Company consists of the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale and retail sale of water.  San Jose Water Company provides water service to customers in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, Saratoga and the Town of Los Gatos, and adjacent unincorporated territories, all in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California.  San Jose Water Company distributes water to customers in accordance with accepted water utility methods which include pumping from storage and gravity feed from high elevation reservoirs.  San Jose Water Company also provides non-tariffed services under agreements with municipalities and other utilities.  These non-tariffed services include water system operations, maintenance agreements and antenna leases. 
  San Jose Water Company has utility property including land held in fee, impounding reservoirs, diversion facilities, wells, distribution storage, and all water facilities, equipment, office buildings and other property necessary to supply its customers.  Under Section 851 of the California Public Utilities Code, properties currently used and useful in providing utilities services cannot be disposed of unless California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) approval is obtained. 
  San Jose Water Company also has approximately 410 acres of nonutility property which has been identified as no longer used and useful in providing utility services.  The majority of the properties are located in the hillside areas adjacent to San Jose Water Company's various watershed properties. 
  
   18 

SJW Land Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., owned the following real properties during the year-to-date period ended   September 30, 2016  : 

SJW Land Company owns a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P.  One of the California properties is owned by such partnership.  The limited partnership has been determined to be a variable interest entity within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 810    Consolidation  with SJW Land Company as the primary beneficiary, and as a result, it has been consolidated with SJW Land Company.  
  SJWTX, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., doing business as Canyon Lake Water Service Company ( CLWSC ), is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 13,000 connections that serve approximately 39,000 people.  CLWSC's service area comprises more than 243 square miles in western Comal County and southern Blanco County in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas.  SJWTX, Inc. has a 25% interest in Acequia Water Supply Corporation ( Acequia ).  The water supply corporation has been determined to be a variable interest entity within the scope of ASC Topic 810 with SJWTX, Inc. as the primary beneficiary.  As a result, Acequia has been consolidated with SJWTX, Inc. 
  Texas Water Alliance Limited ( TWA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., has acquired permits and leases necessary to develop a water supply project in Texas.  TWA obtained groundwater production and transportation permits to meet the future water needs in the CLWSC's service area and to the central Texas hill country communities and utilities adjacent to the area.  In February 2016, we entered into an agreement with Guadalupe Blanco River Authority ( GBRA ), pursuant to which SJW Corp. agreed to sell all of its equity interest in TWA to GBRA for $31,000.  The agreement is subject to specified closing conditions, including completion of a financing by GBRA to fund the purchase price.    There is no guarantee that all of the closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner, or at all.  If we are not able to close the sale of TWA timely, or at all, it may adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
  SJW Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 2015 for the sole purpose of effectuating a change in the state of incorporation of SJW Corp. from California to Delaware (the  Reincorporation ).  The Reincorporation requires the approval of the CPUC and Public Utilities Commission of Texas ( PUCT ).  On March 24, 2016 and May 26, 2016, the PUCT and the CPUC, respectively, issued a decision authorizing the Reincorporation.  We intend to cause the reincorporation to become effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to the completion of certain legal formalities. 

Business Strategy for Water Utility Services: 
  SJW Corp. focuses its business initiatives in three strategic areas: 
           (1) 
    Regional regulated water utility operations; 
              (2) 
    Regional non-tariffed water utility related services provided in accordance with the guidelines established by the CPUC in California and the PUCT in Texas; and 
              (3) 
    Out-of-region water and utility related services. 
     As part of our pursuit of the above three strategic areas, the Company considers from time to time opportunities to acquire businesses and assets.  However, SJW Corp. cannot be certain it will be successful in identifying and consummating any strategic business acquisitions relating to such opportunities.  In addition, the execution of our business strategy will expose us to different risks than those associated with the current utility operations.  We expect to incur costs in connection with the execution of this strategy and any integration of an acquired business could involve significant costs, the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities related to the acquired assets, the diversion of management's time and resources, the potential for a negative impact on SJW Corp.'s financial position and operating results, entering markets in which SJW Corp. has no or limited direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired company.  Any future acquisition we  
  
   19 

decide to undertake may also impact our ability to finance our business, affect our compliance with regulatory requirements, and impose additional burdens on our operations.  Any businesses we acquire may not achieve sales, customer growth and projected profitability that would justify the investment.  Any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls.  SJW Corp. cannot be certain that any transaction will be successful or that it will not materially harm its operating results or financial condition. 
  Real Estate Services: 
  SJW Corp.'s real estate investment activity is conducted through SJW Land Company.  SJW Land Company owns undeveloped land in the states of California and Tennessee and owns and operates a portfolio of commercial buildings in the states of California, Arizona and Tennessee.  On October 13, 2016, title to the Arizona property transferred from SJW Land Company as a result of the Arizona Department of Transportation exercising their powers of eminent domain.  See Note 3 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the Arizona property.  SJW Land Company also owns a limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P.  The partnership owns a commercial building in San Jose, California.  SJW Land Company manages its income producing and other properties until such time a determination is made to reinvest proceeds from sale of such properties.  SJW Land Company's real estate investments diversify SJW Corp.'s asset base. 

Critical Accounting Policies: 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in our 2015 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included as part of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Our critical accounting policies are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies.  Our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the   2015   consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  which supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific guidance.  On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed to defer by one year the mandatory effective date, but will also provide entities the option to adopt it as of the original effective date.  The updated standard will become mandatory for SJW Corp. in the first quarter of 2018 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  Management is currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and anticipates that the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall  which will significantly change the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected and require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income instead of through other comprehensive income.  The update is effective for SJW Corp. beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.  Management is currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.  ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations.  The update will become effective for SJW Corp. in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations: 
  Water sales are seasonal in nature and influenced by weather conditions.  The timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water consumption by customers to vary significantly.  Due to the seasonal nature of the water business, the operating results for interim periods are not indicative of the operating results for a 12-month period.  Revenue is generally higher in the warm, dry summer months when water usage and sales are greater, and lower in the winter months when cooler temperatures and increased rainfall curtail water usage and sales.   
  See Note 1 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the California drought and political and regulatory activities that have occurred in response to ongoing drought conditions.  
  Overview 
  SJW Corp.'s consolidated net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was $18,959, an increase of $9,425, or approximately 99%, from $9,534 for the same period in   2015  .  SJW Corp.'s consolidated net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $39,112  , an increase of $17,422, or approximately 80%, from   $21,690   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in operating revenue as a result of an increase in rates, recognition of $6,555 in revenue from the Water Conservation Memorandum Account ( WCMA ) and an increase in customer usage.  The increase in net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in operating revenue as a result of an increase in rates, recognition of $13,067 in revenue from the WCMA, net recognition of $6,830 in true-up revenue resulting from the 2012 and 2015 General Rate Case decisions.  In addition, a gain on the sale of   159,151   shares of California Water Service Group generated a pre-tax increase of $3,197 for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Operating Revenue 

The change in consolidated operating revenues was due to the following factors:

The change in consolidated operating expenses was due to the following factors: 

Sources of Water Supply 
  San Jose Water Company's water supply consists of groundwater from wells, surface water from watershed run-off and diversion, reclaimed water, and imported water purchased from the SCVWD under the terms of a master contract with SCVWD expiring in 2051.  Surface water is the least expensive source of water.  Changes and variations in quantities from each of these sources affect the overall mix of the water supply, thereby affecting the cost of the water supply.  In addition, the water rate for purchased water and the groundwater extraction charge may be increased by the SCVWD at any time.  If an increase occurs, then San Jose Water Company would file an advice letter with the CPUC seeking authorization to increase revenues to offset the cost increase. 
  CLWSC's water supply consists of groundwater from wells and purchased treated and untreated raw water from the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority ( GBRA ).  CLWSC has long-term agreements with the GBRA, which expire in 2037, 2040, 2044 and 2050.  The agreements, which are take-or-pay contracts, provide CLWSC with an aggregate of 6,900 acre-feet of water per year from Canyon Lake at prices that may be adjusted periodically by GBRA.      Effective January 1, 2016, production wells located in a Comal Trinity Groundwater Conservation District, a regulated portion of the Trinity aquifer, are required to submit groundwater pump tax based upon usage. 
  The following table presents the change in sources of water supply, in million gallons, for Water Utility Services: 

The changes in the source of supply mix were consistent with the changes in the water production expenses. 
  Unaccounted-for water on a 12-month-to-date basis for   September 30, 2016   and   2015   approximated 8.2% and 7.2%, respectively, as a percentage of total production.  The increase in unaccounted-for water is primarily due to a higher loss percentage due to the impact of lower flows through the system as a result of conservation activities for the eight months of period, partially offset by Water Utility Services' main replacements and lost water reduction programs. 
  Water Production Expenses 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , the increase in water production expenses was primarily attributable to higher per unit costs for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges.  Effective July 1, 2016, SCVWD increased the unit price of purchased water by approximately 18% and the groundwater extraction charge by approximately 20%.  
  
   22 

Other Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses, excluding water production expenses, increased $1,841 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $931 in depreciation and amortization expense due to increases in utility plant, an increase of $348 in administrative and general expenses due to annual wage increases, an increase in property and other non-income taxes of $320 as a result of increased utility plant additions and annual assessments, and an increase of $242 in maintenance expenses.  
  Operating expenses, excluding water production expenses, increased $4,901 for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $2,940 in depreciation and amortization expense due to increases in utility plant, an increase of $895 in maintenance expenses due to annual wage increases and station repairs and maintenance, an increase of $829 in administrative and general expenses primarily due to an increase in salaries, partially offset by a decrease in pension expense, and an increase of $237 in property and other non-income taxes as a result of increased additions and annual assessments.   
  Other (Expense) Income 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, the change in other income was primarily due to a gain on the sale of San Jose Water Company nonutility properties that occurred in August 2015.   
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , the change in other (expense) income was primarily due a pre-tax gain on the sale of 159,151 shares of California Water Service Group stock for $3,197. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , income tax expense increased $6,975 and $12,809, respectively, as a result of higher pre-tax income.  The effective consolidated income tax rate was 40% and 37%, respectively, for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  The lower rate in 2015 was due to additional state depreciation deductions. 
  SJW Corp. is currently undergoing an income tax examination by the California Franchise Tax Board for refund claims for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. 
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The change in other comprehensive income (loss) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was due to the change in market value and partial sale of the Company's investment in California Water Service Group. 
  Water Supply 
  On October 3, 2016, SCVWD's 10 reservoirs were approximately 41% full with 68,600 acre-feet of water in storage.  As reported by the SCVWD, there was no recorded rainfall in San Jose for the current rainfall season that commenced on July 1, 2016.  There was no recorded rainfall at San Jose Water Company's Lake Elsman for the current rainfall season.  Under normal hydrologic conditions, state and federal water allocations represent approximately 40% of the SCVWD's total annual supply.  As of October 1, 2016, the SCVWD reported that allocations from the state and federal water project are approximately 60% and 55%, respectively, of amounts requested in 2016.  SCVWD also reported that they are taking advantage of recently improved water supply conditions by increasing groundwater recharge operations.  The groundwater level in the Santa Clara Plain is approximately 26 feet higher than a year ago in September and 23 feet higher than the five-year average.  According to SCVWD, the predicted total groundwater storage at the end of 2016 will fall within the alert stage if the remainder of 2016 is dry and the SCVWD's target of 20% reduction in water use compared to 2013 water usage is met. 
  On October 1, 2016, San Jose Water Company's Lake Elsman contained 4,244 acre-feet of water, of which approximately 3,784 acre-feet can be utilized.  Local surface water is a less costly source of water than groundwater or purchased water and its availability significantly impacts San Jose Water Company's results of operations.  San Jose Water Company will utilize surface water and additional water from its portfolio of groundwater supplies to supplement imported water from the SCVWD.  San Jose Water Company believes that its various water supply sources will be sufficient to meet customer demand through the remainder of   2016  .  
  See Note 1 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the California drought and political and regulatory activities that have occurred in response to ongoing drought conditions. 
  SJW Corp. and San Jose Water Company provide additional information on their web sites relating to ongoing water conservation measures taken or to be taken in response to the historical drought conditions in California, including information on customer water usage.  The web sites are accessible at www.sjwater.com and www.sjwcorp.com.  SJW Corp. intends to update the web sites as appropriate during the period in which the water shortage contingency plan of SCVWD remains in

effect.    The information on our web sites is not a part of and should not be considered incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q.    
  CLWSC's water supply consists of groundwater from wells and purchased treated and untreated raw water from the GBRA.  CLWSC has long-term agreements with the GBRA, which expire in 2037, 2040, 2044 and 2050.  The agreements, which are take-or-pay contracts, provide CLWSC with an aggregate of 6,900 acre-feet of water per year from Canyon Lake at prices that may be adjusted periodically by GBRA.   
  Regulation and Rates 
  Almost all of the operating revenue of San Jose Water Company results from the sale of water at rates authorized by the CPUC.  The CPUC sets rates that are intended to provide revenue sufficient to recover operating expenses and the opportunity to achieve a specified return on common equity.  The timing of rate decisions could have an impact on the results of operations. 
  See Note 8 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the regulatory activities that have occurred during the year.  

Liquidity: 
  Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , SJW Corp. generated cash flows from operations of approximately $76,400, compared to $72,300 for the same period in   2015  .  Cash flow from operations is primarily generated by net income from revenue producing activities, adjusted for non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, gains on the sale of assets, and changes in working capital items.  Cash flow from operations increased by approximately $4,100.  This increase was caused by a combination of the following factors: (1) net income adjusted for non-cash items and gains from asset activity increased $31,100, offset by (2) net collection of taxes receivable that was $13,300 less than prior period, (3) collections of previously billed and accrued receivables which decreased by $9,400, (4) recognition and collection of the balancing and memorandum accounts, including the regulatory asset recorded in other current assets, which drove a net decrease of $2,800, and (5) changes in general working capital caused a $1,500 decrease.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Water Utility Services' write-offs for uncollectible accounts represent less than 1% of its total revenue, unchanged from   September 30, 2015  .  Management believes it will continue to collect its accounts receivable balances at its historical collection rate. 
  Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , SJW Corp. used cash flows in investing activities of approximately $86,700, compared to $74,300 for the same period in   2015  .  SJW Corp. used approximately   $102,800   of cash for company-funded capital expenditures, $5,700 for developer-funded capital expenditures, $1,400 for asset acquisitions and rights to provide water service, $1,100 in utility plant retirement costs, and $300 for additions to nonutility property which was offset by a $20,000 deposit for the final settlement of the Arizona property classified as long-lived asset held-for-sale, $4,500 of proceeds from the sale of California Water Service Group stock, and $100 of proceeds from the sale of real estate investments. 
  Water Utility Services' budgeted capital expenditures for   2016  , exclusive of capital expenditures financed by customer contributions and advances, are approximately   $145,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $102,800   or 71% of the   $145,000   has been spent. 
  Water Utility Services' capital expenditures are incurred in connection with normal upgrading and expansion of existing facilities and to comply with environmental regulations.  Over the next five years, Water Utility Services expects to incur approximately $618,000 in capital expenditures, which includes replacement of pipes and mains, and maintaining water systems.  This amount is subject to CPUC and PUCT approval.  Included in this amount is $46,900 relating to upgrades to San Jose Water Company's 40-year old Montevina Water Treatment Plant.  Capital expenditures have the effect of increasing utility plant on which Water Utility Services earns a return.  Water Utility Services actual capital expenditures may vary from their projections due to changes in the expected demand for services, weather patterns, actions by governmental agencies, and general economic conditions.  Total additions to utility plant normally exceed Company-financed additions as a result of new facilities construction funded with advances from developers and contributions in aid of construction. 
  A substantial portion of San Jose Water Company's distribution system was constructed during the period from 1945 to 1980.  Expenditure levels for renewal and modernization of this part of the system will grow at an increasing rate as these components reach the end of their useful lives.  In most cases, replacement cost will significantly exceed the original installation cost of the retired assets due to increases in the costs of goods and services and increased regulation.  
  
   24 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased by approximately $16,800 from the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in net borrowings on the line of credit offset by an increase in repayments of long-term borrowings which included the payoff of the Arizona warehouse mortgage and the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund loans. 

Sources of Capital: 
  San Jose Water Company's ability to finance future construction programs and sustain dividend payments depends on its ability to maintain or increase internally generated funds and attract external financing.  The level of future earnings and the related cash flow from operations is dependent, in large part, upon the timing and outcome of regulatory proceedings. 
  San Jose Water Company's financing activity is designed to achieve a capital structure consistent with regulatory guidelines of approximately 49% debt and 51% equity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , San Jose Water Company's funded debt and equity were approximately   43%   and 57%, respectively. 
  Funding for San Jose Water Company's future capital expenditure program is expected to be provided primarily through internally-generated funds, the issuance of new long-term debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of all or part of our investment in California Water Service Group, all of which will be consistent with the regulator's guidelines.

  San Jose Water Company's loan agreement with the California Pollution Control Financing Authority contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for a loan agreement relating to revenue bonds, including, among other things, complying with certain disclosure obligations and covenants relating to the tax exempt status of the interest on the bonds and limitations and prohibitions relating to the transfer of the projects funded by the loan proceeds and the assignment of the loan agreement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , San Jose Water was in compliance with all such covenants.

As of   September 30, 2016  , SJWTX, Inc. and SJW Corp. were not restricted from issuing future indebtedness as a result of these terms and conditions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , SJW Corp. and its subsidiaries had unsecured bank lines of credit, allowing aggregate short-term borrowings of up to $145,000, of which $15,000 was available to SJW Corp. and SJW Land Company under a single line of credit, $5,000 was available to SJWTX, Inc. under a second line of credit, and $125,000 was available to San Jose Water Company under a third line of credit.  At   September 30, 2016  , SJW Corp. and its subsidiaries had available unused short-term bank lines of credit of   $81,100  .  These lines of credit bear interest at variable rates and expire on June 1, 2021.  The cost of borrowing on SJW Corp.'s short-term credit facilities has averaged 1.5% as of   September 30, 2016  .  The SJW Corp. and SJWTX, Inc. unsecured bank lines of credit have the following affirmative covenants calculated with the financial statements of SJW Corp., on a consolidated basis:  (1) the funded debt cannot exceed 66-2/3% of total capitalization, and (2) net income available for interest charges for the trailing 12-calendar-month period cannot be less than 175% of interest charges.

On February 22, 2016, SJW Corp. entered into a purchase and sale Agreement with the GBRA pursuant to which SJW Corp. agreed to sell all of its equity interest in TWA to GBRA for $31,000 in cash.  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, (i) upon closing of the transaction, GBRA will hold back $3,000 in the payment of the total purchase price and (ii) such holdback amount, subject to reductions under certain circumstances, shall be paid to SJW Corp. four years following the closing.  The TWA Agreement is subject to specified closing conditions, including without limitation, the completion of a financing by GBRA to fund the purchase price.  There is no guarantee that all of the closing conditions will be satisfied, and the failure to complete the sale of TWA may adversely affect the financial conditions and results of operations of SJW Corp. 
  SJW Land Company negotiated a settlement value of $20,000 with the Arizona Department of Transportation for SJW Land Company's warehouse building located in Phoenix, Arizona.  Title to the property transferred to Arizona Department of Transportation on October 13, 2016 upon the recording of the court's Final Order of Condemnation.  SJW Land Company will record a gain, net of taxes and expenses, of approximately $5,800 during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     SJW Corp. is subject to market risks in the normal course of business, including changes in interest rates, pension plan asset values, and equity prices.  The exposure to changes in interest rates can result from the issuance of debt and short-term funds obtained through SJW Corp.'s variable rate lines of credit.  San Jose Water Company sponsors a noncontributory pension plan for its employees.  Pension costs and the funded status of the plan are affected by a number of factors including the discount rate and investment returns on plan assets.  SJW Corp. also owned   100,000   shares of common stock of California Water Service Group as of   September 30, 2016  , which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and is therefore exposed to the risk of fluctuations and changes in equity prices. 
  SJW Corp. has no derivative financial instruments, financial instruments with significant off-balance sheet risks, or financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk.  

ITEM 4. 
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     SJW Corp.'s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of SJW Corp.'s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that SJW Corp.'s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report have been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by SJW Corp. in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  SJW Corp. believes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
  There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting during the third fiscal quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal controls over financial reporting of SJW Corp. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     SJW Corp. is subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.  There are no pending legal proceedings to which SJW Corp. or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or to which any of its properties is the subject, that are expected to have a material effect on SJW Corp.'s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the  Risk Factors  in SJW Corp.'s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  Other than the risk factor listed below, there have been no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in  Risk Factors  in SJW Corp.'s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

26 

We entered into an agreement to sell all of our equity interests in TWA, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to close the sale in a timely manner or at all.  
    
  On February 22, 2016, SJW Corp. entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the GBRA, a conservation and reclamation district and political subdivision of the State of Texas, pursuant to which SJW Corp. agreed to sell all of its equity interests in TWA to GBRA for $31,000 in cash.  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, (i) upon closing of the transaction, GBRA will hold back $3,000 in the payment of the total purchase price and (ii) such holdback amount, subject to reductions under certain circumstances, shall be paid to SJW Corp. four years following the closing.  The purchase and sale agreement is subject to specified closing conditions, including without limitation, the completion of a financing by GBRA to fund the purchase price.   There is no guarantee that all of the closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner, or at all.  If we are not able to close the sale of TWA timely, or at all, it may adversely affect our business and financial condition.      

ITEM 5. 
    OTHER INFORMATION
