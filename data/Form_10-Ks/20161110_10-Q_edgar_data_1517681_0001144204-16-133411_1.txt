NOTE 1  
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES  

Nature of Operations  

Propanc PTY LTD
was incorporated in Melbourne, Victoria Australia on October 15, 2007, and is based in Camberwell, Victoria Australia. Since
inception, substantially all of the efforts of the Company have been the development of new cancer treatments targeting high risk
patients who need a follow up, nontoxic, long term therapy which prevents the cancer from returning and spreading. The Company
anticipates establishing global markets for its technologies. 

On November 23,
2010, Propanc Health Group Corporation (the  Company,   we,   us,   our ) was
incorporated in the state of Delaware. In January 2011, to reorganize the Company, Propanc Health Group Corporation acquired all
of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY LTD on a one-for-one basis making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Basis of Presentation  

The interim unaudited
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly our results of operations for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and our financial
position as of September 30, 2016 have been made. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 

Certain information
and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual audited consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted
from these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, these interim unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2016. The June 30, 2016 balance sheet is derived from those statements. 

Principals
of Consolidation  

The unaudited
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Propanc Health Group Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Propanc
PTY LTD. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.  Significant estimates in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include
the estimates of useful lives for depreciation, valuation of derivatives, valuation of beneficial conversion features on convertible
debt, allowance for uncollectable receivables, valuation of equity based instruments issued for other than cash, the valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets and foreign currency translation due to certain average exchange rates applied in lieu of spot
rates on transaction dates.

Foreign Currency Translation and Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss)  

The Company s
functional currency is the Australian dollar (AUD). For financial reporting purposes, the Australian dollar has been translated
into United States dollars ($) and/or (USD) as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the
reporting period. Equity transactions are translated at each historical transaction date spot rate. Translation adjustments arising
from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders  equity (deficit)
as  accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as other income (expense). There have been no significant fluctuations
in the exchange rate for the conversion of Australian dollars to USD after the balance sheet date. 

Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss) for all periods presented includes only foreign currency translation gains (losses). 

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date with any transaction
gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency included in the consolidated results of operations as incurred. 

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the exchange rates
used to translate amounts in Australian dollars into USD for the purposes of preparing the unaudited financial statements were
as follows: 

Changes in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) by Component during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  

The Company measures
their financial assets and liabilities in accordance with US GAAP. For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, the carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Amounts recorded for loans payable, also approximate fair value
because current interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities are substantially the same. 

The Company adopted
accounting guidance for fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a material impact
on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance
for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements but rather
applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to
measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service
capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

  (unaudited)  

Level 1: Observable
inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: Unobservable
inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect
those that a market participant would use. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand and at banks, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less with financial
institutions, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are reflected as a current liability on the balance sheets. There were
no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016. 

Patents  

Patent costs are
stated at cost and reclassified to intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods if
and once the patent has been granted by a regulatory agency, however, the Company will expense any costs as long as the Company
is in the startup stage. Accordingly, as the Company's product was and is not currently approved for market, thus any patent costs
incurred from 2013 through 2016 were expensed immediately. Currently, the Company has five international patents pending which
were jointly applied for by the Company and another entity. 

For its lead patent,
the Company received grant status, or has been accepted in South Africa, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and New Zealand. 
In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark office (the  USPTO ) and the European Patent Office (the  EPO )
have made preliminary indications that key features of the Company s technology are patentable. The Company is presently
working towards securing a patent in each region, covering as many aspects of its technology as possible, while also actively seeking
protection throughout Eastern Europe, Asia and South America.  

Individual countries and regions where
the Company is actively seeking protection for its lead patent include the United States, Canada, Brazil, China, Mexico, Hong Kong,
Israel, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, Europe, Russia, India and South Korea. 

Of the four patents, the Company has either
filed an application or is presently under examination in the country of origin. Two patent applications have been filed in the
United States, one patent application has been filed in Spain and another in Australia. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets  

In accordance
with ASC 360-10, Long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability
of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market
value, if readily determinable.

Australian
Goods and Services Tax (GST)  

Revenues, expenses
and balance sheet items are recognized net of the amount of GST except payable and receivable balances which are shown inclusive
of GST. The GST incurred is payable on revenues to, and recoverable on purchases from, the Australian Taxation Office. 

Cash flows are
presented in the statements of cash flow on a gross basis, except for the GST component of investing and financing activities,
which are disclosed as operating cash flows. 

As of September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company was owed $9,948 and $29,355, respectively, from the Australian Taxation Office. These amounts
were fully collected subsequent to the balance sheet reporting dates. 

Derivative Instruments  

ASC Topic 815,
  Derivatives and Hedging   ( ASC Topic 815 ), establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured
at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in
other comprehensive income (loss) depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify and have been designated
for hedge accounting treatment. The Company does not have any derivative instruments for which it has applied hedge accounting
treatment. 

Convertible Notes With Variable Conversion Options  

The Company has
entered into convertible notes, some of which contain variable conversion options, whereby the outstanding principal and accrued
interest may be converted, by the holder, into common shares at a fixed discount to the price of the common stock at the time of
conversion. The Company treats these convertible notes as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and measures the fair value of the notes
at the time of issuance, which is the result of the share price discount at the time of conversion, and records the put premium
as accretion to interest expense to the date of first conversion. 

Income Taxes  

The Company is
governed by Australia and United States income tax laws, which are administered by the Australian Taxation Office and the
United States Internal Revenue Service, respectively. The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
ASC 740 when accounting for income taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting
for income taxes.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between
the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  Income
tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities. 

The Company adopted
provisions of ASC 740, Sections 25 through 60,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.   These sections provide
detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in
the financial statements. Tax positions must meet a  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold at the effective date
to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740 and in subsequent periods.

Research and
Development Costs and Tax Credits  

In accordance
with ASC 730-10, research and development costs are expensed when incurred.  Total research and development costs
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $161,197 and $153,474, respectively. 

The Company may
apply for research and development tax concessions with the Australian Taxation Office on an annual basis.  Although the amount
is possible to estimate at year end, the Australian Taxation Office may reject or materially alter the claim amount. Accordingly,
the Company does not recognize the benefit of the claim amount until cash receipt since collectability is not certain until such
time.  The tax concession is a refundable credit.  If the Company has net income then the Company can receive
the credit which reduces its income tax liability.  If the Company has net losses, then the Company may still receive
a cash payment for the credit, however, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards are reduced by the gross equivalent loss
that would produce the credit amount when the income tax rate is applied to that gross amount.  The concession is recognized
as an income tax benefit, in operations, upon receipt. 

Stock Based
Compensation  

The Company records
stock based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ) and Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ( SAB 107 )  Share Based Payment  issued by the SEC in March 2005 regarding its interpretation
of ASC 718.  ASC 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded
as an expense over the related requisite service period. The Company values employee and non-employee stock based compensation
at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. 

The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in
accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.  

Revenue Recognition  

In accordance
with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition , (codified in ASC 605), the Company recognizes revenue
when (i) persuasive evidence of a customer or distributor arrangement exists or acceptance occurs, (ii) a retailer, distributor
or wholesaler receives the goods, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability of the sales revenues is reasonably
assured. Subject to these criteria, the Company recognizes revenue relating to royalties on product sales in the period in which
the sale occurs and the royalty term has begun. 

Basic and Diluted
Net Loss Per Common Share  

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period.  Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially
dilutive securities consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of common stock equivalents such as stock
options, warrants and convertible debt instruments.  Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation
if their effect is anti-dilutive. As a result, the basic and diluted per share amounts for all periods presented are identical.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were 238,879,158 warrants outstanding, 143,000,000 stock options and five
convertible notes payable that are convertible into 185,997,987 common shares respectively which are considered dilutive securities
which were excluded from the computation since the effect is anti-dilutive.  

Recently Adopted
Accounting Pronouncements  

FASB, Accounting
Standard Updates ( ASU ) which are not effective until after September 30, 2016 are not expected to have a significant
effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company is evaluating or has implemented
the following at September 30, 2016: 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ).
ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice regarding how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance on the classification
of the following items: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3)
contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5)
proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments,
(7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows. The Company is required to
adopt ASU 2016-15 for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 on a
retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-15.

  (unaudited)  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transaction, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. These changes become effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017. The
Company has not determined the effects of this update on the Company s consolidated financial statements at this time. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases,  which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by
most leases on the balance sheet. The changes become effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019. Modified
retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, is required with an
option to use certain transition relief. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the Company s consolidated
financial statements at this time. 

On May 8, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-08,
  Business Combinations (Topic 805) Pushdown Accounting   which conforms the FASB s guidance on pushdown
accounting with the SEC s guidance. ASU 2015-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. As of
September 30, 2016, this ASU has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which changes the presentation of
debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under this guidance such costs would be presented as a direct deduction from the related
debt liability rather than as an asset. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, this ASU has not had a material impact on the consolidated balances current presentation. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities
as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to
be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability. This ASU
is effective for the Company on April 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to

GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the
Company as a going concern.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had no revenues, had a net loss
of $1,101,969 and had net cash used in operations of $683,598. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had a
working capital deficit, stockholders' deficit and accumulated deficit of $1,818,677, $1,803,954 and $31,477,992 respectively.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The unaudited
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Successful completion
of the Company s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future events,
including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities, acceptance of the Company's International patent
applications and achieving a level of sales adequate to support the Company s cost structure. However, there can be no assurances
that the Company will be able to secure additional equity investments or achieve an adequate sales level.

for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 5   CONVERTIBLE NOTES  

Convertible notes at September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

May 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement  

On May 19, 2015, the Company entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ), to issue a series of nine back end convertible notes in the principal sum
of $782,500, pursuant to the SPA, the Company issued to the lender nine convertible promissory notes termed  Back-End Notes ,
in the amounts of $37,500 ( Back-End Note 1 ), $37,500 ( Back-End Note 2 ), $157,500 ( Back-End Note 3 ),
$150,000 ( Back-End Note 4 ), $17,500 ( Back-End Note 5 ), $37,500 ( Back-End Note 6 ), $37,500 ( Back-End
Note 7 ), $157,500 ( Back-End Note 6 ) and $150,000 ( Back-End Note 9 ). These notes have the same terms
as the initial convertible notes. Each Back-End Note shall initially be paid for by an offsetting promissory note issued to the
Company by the lender ( Note Receivable ) provided that prior to the conversion of the Back-End Notes, the holders must
have paid off the Notes Receivable in cash. Each Note Receivable is due on May 19, 2016, unless the Company does not meet the  current
public information  requirement pursuant to Rule 144, in which case both the Back-End Notes and the Notes Receivable may
both be cancelled. Each Note Receivable is initially secured by the pledge of the Back-End Notes, but may be exchanged for other
collateral with an appraised value of at least the principal amount of the note less the original issue discount ( OID ),
upon the Company s approval following a three (3) day written notice to the Company. The term of the Notes Receivable and
the Back-End Notes are one year, upon which the outstanding principal and interest is payable. The amounts funded plus accrued
interest under Back-End Notes are convertible into common stock at any time after the requisite Rule 144 holding period (subject
to the condition above for the Back-End Notes), at a conversion price equal to 55% of the lowest trading bid price in the ten (10)
trading days prior to the conversion. During the year ended June 30, 2016, all of the Back-End Notes (an aggregate total principal
of $782,500) were issued.

  CONDENSED NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30,

  (unaudited)  

The Back-End Notes may not be prepaid,
except that if the initial convertible notes are redeemed by the Company within six months of their issuance, all obligations of
the Company and holders under the Back-End Notes and the Notes Receivable will be deemed satisfied and such notes shall automatically
be deemed cancelled and of no further force or effect. 

In the event of two specific defaults,
which include the maintenance of a minimum trading price and an aggregate dollar trading volume of the Company's common shares,
the holders may cancel the Back-End Notes and the related Notes Receivable and otherwise in the event of other defaults as defined
in the securities purchase agreement, the amount of principal and accrued interest will become immediately due and payable and
may be offset by amounts due to the Company by the holders. Additionally, the Back-End Notes will bear default interest at a rate
of 24% per annum or the highest rate of interest permitted by law. 

Since the Back-End Notes are not convertible
until the Notes Receivable are paid, and the Notes Receivable and Back-End Notes have a right of setoff, the Notes Receivable and
Back-End Notes and related accrued interest receivable and payable have been netted for presentation purposes on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. 

On July 14, 2015, the Company received
payment of three Note Receivables of $352,500 that offset three of the Back-End Notes that were issued on May 19, 2015. Proceeds
from the Note Receivables of $17,690 were paid directly to legal fees resulting in net cash proceeds of $334,810 received by the
Company. These Back-End Notes are related to the initial convertible notes that were issued on May 19, 2015 and have the same terms
as previously discussed. As a result, these Back-End Notes are now eligible for conversion at a rate of 55% of the lowest trading
bid price of the Company s common stock for the ten prior trading days including the date upon which the conversion notice
was received. These convertible notes are treated as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and accordingly the Company is accreting
a $288,409 put premium over 180 days from the execution of the convertible notes. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company
converted $320,000 of principal and accrued interest of $15,864 into shares of the Company s common stock (See Note 6). During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company converted $32,500 of principal and accrued interest of $2,885 into shares
of the Company s common stock (See Note 6). Additionally, for the period ending September 30, 2016 and year ending June 30,
2016, these conversions resulted in a $26,591 and $261,818 reduction of the put premium, respectively. This note was fully converted
on September 30, 2016. 

On October 14, 2015 and October 15, 2015,
the Company received payment of six Note Receivables of $430,000 that offset the remaining six of the Back-End Notes that were
issued on May 19, 2015. Proceeds from the Note Receivables of $22,265 were paid directly to legal fees resulting in net cash proceeds
of $407,735 received by the Company. These Back-End Notes are related to the initial convertible notes that were issued on May
19, 2015 and have the same terms as previously discussed. As a result, these Back-End Notes are now eligible for conversion at
a rate of 55% of the lowest trading bid price of the Company s common stock for the ten prior trading days including the
date upon which the conversion notice was received. These convertible notes are treated as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and
accordingly the Company is accreting a $351,818 put premium over 180 days from the execution of the convertible notes. During the
year ended June 30, 2016, the Company has accreted $351,818 of the put premium resulting in the put premium being fully expensed.
During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company converted $300,000 of principal and accrued interest of $11,356 into shares of
the Company s common stock (See Note 6). During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company converted $17,500
of principal and accrued interest $1,350 into shares of the Company s common stock (See Note 6). Additionally, for the period
ending September 30, 2016 and year ending June 30, 2016, these conversions resulted in $14,318 and $245,455 reduction of the put
premium, respectively. Accrued interest as of September 30, 2016 was $5,663.  Total outstanding principal owed under this
note was $112,500 as of September 30, 2016.

October 2015
Securities Purchase Agreement and Debenture  

On October 28,
2015 (the  Closing Date ), the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement dated as of the Closing Date (the
 Purchase Agreement ) with a third party purchaser (the  Purchaser ). The Purchase Agreement provides that,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Purchaser will invest $4,000,000 ( Investment Amount )
in exchange for a Convertible Debenture (the  Debenture ) in the principal amount of $4,400,000 (the  Principal
Amount ) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 26,190,476 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001
per share, for an exercise price of $0.60 per share for a period of four (4) years from the Closing Date (the  Warrants ).
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company issued the Debenture and Warrant to the Purchaser. 

Under the terms
of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to deliver the Promissory Note entered into by the Company and Purchaser on September
24, 2015 with a principal amount of $1,200,000 (the  Prior Note ). The parties further agreed that the Prior Note was
deemed cancelled upon the delivery by the Purchaser to the Company and the amount of the Prior Note is included in the Investment
Amount under the Purchase Agreement. 

Under the terms
of the Purchase Agreement and Debenture, $2,800,000 of the Investment Amount will be deposited into a deposit control account and
such amount will remain in the deposit control account pending the achievement of certain milestones by the Company and the satisfaction
of certain equity conditions set forth in the Debenture. Additionally, under the Debenture, the Principal Amount will be reduced
by $25,000 if the Company files a registration statement with the SEC within 30 days following the Closing Date. The Principal
Amount will be reduced by an additional $25,000 if the registration statement is deemed effective within 100 days after the Closing
Date. On November 23, 2015, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC and on December 10, 2015, the registration
statement was deemed effective. Both of these conditions were met resulting in a $50,000 reduction of the Principal Amount which
was credited to interest expense such that the aggregate principal amount was $4,350,000. 

The Purchase Agreement
contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by, among and for the benefit of the parties. The Company also agreed
to pay up to $50,000 of reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the transaction.
The Purchase Agreement also provides for indemnification of the Purchaser and its affiliates in the event that the Purchaser incurs
losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses related to a breach by the Company of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Purchase Agreement. 

The Debenture
has a 10% original issue discount and matures on October 28, 2016. The Principal Amount of the Debenture accrues interest at the
rate of 5% per annum based on the $4,350,000 note agreement with a one year value guarantee of $217,500, payable quarterly in cash
(or if certain conditions are met, in stock at the Company s option) on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The Debenture
was, prior to the Addendum (as defined below), convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the Purchaser s option into
shares of the Company s Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.042, which is the volume weighted average price of
the Company s Common Stock five days prior to the execution of the Debenture (subject to adjustment) (the  Conversion
Price ). At any time after the effective date of the registration statement, the Purchaser has the opportunity to convert
up to an aggregate of $2,090,000 of the Debenture, at one or more conversion dates, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion
price equal to the VWAP of the Common Stock over the five (5) trading days prior to such Effective Date. The Purchaser option to
convert at such a conversion price expires when the Purchaser converts an aggregate of $2,090,000 of the Debenture using such conversion
price. If the volume weighted average price of the Company Common Stock on any trading day is less than the Conversion Price, the
Purchaser may convert at a price per share equal to a twenty percent (20%) discount to the average of the two lowest closing prices
during the five trading days prior to the date of conversion. At no time will the Purchaser be entitled to convert any portion
of the Debenture to the extent that after such conversion, the Purchaser (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own
more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such date. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company withdrew
a principal amount of $2,800,000 from the deposit control account of which $269,976 was paid directly as partial payment of a note
dated June 4, 2015 and $33,437 was paid directly to legal fees resulting in net cash proceeds of $2,496,587 received by the Company.
An aggregate total of $1,955,300 of these notes was bifurcated with the embedded conversion option recorded as a derivative liability
at fair value (See Note 10). During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company converted $2,790,806 of principal and $108,750 of
accrued interest into shares of the Company s common stock (See Note 6). During the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company converted $45,000 of principal and accrued interest of $54,375 into shares of the Company s common stock (See
Note 6). Accrued interest as of September 30, 2016 was $54,375.

The Debenture
includes customary event of default provisions and provides for a default interest rate of 18%. Upon the occurrence of an event
of default, the Purchaser may convert the Debenture into shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to a thirty percent
(30%) discount to the average volume weighted average price of the shares for the three trading days prior to conversion. 

Subject to the
conditions set forth in the Debenture, the Company has the right at any time to redeem some or all of the total outstanding amount
then remaining under the Debenture in cash at a price equal to 125% of the total amount of the Debenture outstanding on the twentieth
(20th) trading date following the date the Company delivers notice of such redemption to the Purchaser. 

The Warrants are
exercisable in whole or in part, at an initial exercise price per share of $0.60, subject to adjustment. The exercise price and
number of shares of the Company s common stock issuable under the Warrants (the  Warrant Shares ) are subject
to adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations, subsequent rights offerings and pro rata distributions. Any adjustment
to the exercise price shall similarly cause the number of warrant shares to be adjusted so that the total value of the Warrants
may increase. In the event that the Warrant Shares are not included in an effective registration statement, the Warrants may be
exercised on a cashless basis. The Company calculated the 26,190,476 warrants at relative fair value, which was $712,110 and amortized
to interest expense during the year ended June 30, 2016. These warrants were exercised during the period ending September 30, 2016,
(see the  July Letter Agreement  below). 

In connection
with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company and the Purchaser also entered into a registration
rights agreement dated as of the Closing Date (the  Registration Rights Agreement ). Pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Company has agreed to file an initial registration statement ( Registration Statement ) with the SEC
to register the resale of the Common Stock into which the Debenture may be converted or the Warrant may be exercised, within 30
days following the Closing Date. The Registration Statement must also be declared effective by the 100th calendar day after the
Closing Date, subject to a 20-day extension as requested by the Company and consented to by the Purchaser. On November 23, 2015,
the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC and on December 10, 2015, the registration statement was deemed effective. 

If at any time
all of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Debenture or the Warrant are not covered by the initial Registration Statement,
the Company has agreed to file with the SEC one or more additional Registration Statements so as to cover all of the shares of
Common Stock underlying the Debenture or the Warrant not covered by such initial Registration Statement, in each case, as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than the applicable filing deadline for such additional Registration Statements as provided
in the Registration Rights Agreement. 

In connection
with the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Security Agreement dated as of even date therewith with the Purchaser whereby
the Company agreed to grant to Purchaser an unconditional and continuing, first priority security interest in all of the assets
and property of the Company to secure the prompt payment, performance and discharge in full of all of the Company s obligations
under the Debentures, Warrants and the other transaction documents until ten days following such time as the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC and the equity conditions set forth in the Debenture are met. 

On March 11, 2016,
the Company entered into an Addendum (the  Addendum ) as discussed below with the Purchaser pursuant to which the Company
and the Purchaser agreed to new terms with respect to that certain securities purchase agreement entered into by and between the
Company and the Purchaser dated as October 28, 2015.

Addendum  

Under the Addendum,
the Company and the Purchaser agreed that the balance of the deposit control account, after giving effect to the amounts released
from such account as of the date of the Addendum, will be released to the Company in two installments as follows: (1) up to $1,200,000
will be released to the Company upon full execution of the Addendum, and (2) up to $375,000 within 60 days of the full execution
of the Addendum as long as certain conditions have been met. 

The Company and
the Purchaser agreed that the new conversion price will be $0.03; provided that in the event that the volume weighted average
price per share on any trading day is less than such conversion price, the conversion price will be adjusted to a price per share
that is equal to a 22.5% discount to the lowest trading price of the common stock in the 10 trading days prior to the date of
conversion. The Company evaluated this note modification under ASC 470-50-40-10 and concluded that it does not apply since the
conversion option is bifurcated and the 10% cash flow test was not met under ASC 470-50. 

Under the Addendum,
the Purchaser agreed to limit the number of shares of common stock it sells on any trading day to an amount of shares that is less
than 25% of the trading volume of the common stock on that same trading day. The Purchaser and the Company may agree otherwise
with respect to this trading limitation. 

The Company also
agreed to reserve an additional 300,000,000 shares for issuance and to file a registration statement on Form S-1 to register shares
covering the resale of all of the additional shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Debenture, as modified
by this Addendum. On March 25, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC and on April 19, 2016, the registration
statement was deemed effective. 

The Company and
the Purchaser agreed that the October Financing Documents, as applicable, will continue in effect and remain in place, except to
the extent modified by the Addendum. 

July Letter
Agreement  

On July 1, 2016,
the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the  July Letter Agreement ) with the Purchaser, and the parties entered
in a letter agreement dated August 3, 2016 (the  August Letter Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company and the Purchaser
agreed to new terms with respect to that certain securities purchase agreement entered into by and between the Company and the
Purchaser dated as of October 28, 2015, as amended by Addendum dated March 11, 2016 and the transactions contemplated thereby.  
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to invest $4,000,000 in exchange for an Original Issue Senior Discount
Secured Debenture (the  Debenture ) and a common stock purchase warrant (the  2015 Warrant ) to purchase
26,190,476 shares of the Company s common stock (the  2015 Warrant Shares ). 

Under the 2015
Letter Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to exercise the 2015 Warrant with respect to all 26,190,476 shares of common stock underlying
the 2015 Warrant. In consideration for the Purchaser s exercise of the 2015 Warrant, the Company agreed to adjust the exercise
price from $0.60 per share to $0.012 per share. In addition, the Company and the Purchaser agreed to modify the July 1, 2016  Interest
Payment Date  and the October 1, 2016  Interest Payment Date  as such terms are defined in the Debenture. Pursuant
to the July Letter Agreement, the Company may delay the interest payment due on the July 1, 2016 Interest Payment Date by a minimum
of 30 calendar days (the  Minimum Extension Date ) and up to 60 calendar days, provided that the Purchaser may demand
payment any time after the Minimum Extension Date. The Company also may delay the interest payment due on the October 1, 2016 Interest
Payment Date to the October 28, 2016 maturity date (the  Maturity Date ) unless the Purchaser demands earlier payment;
provided however, that if the Purchaser has not demanded payment by October 27, 2016, the Maturity Date will be extended until
December 31, 2016 (or such earlier date as the parties mutually agree) and the interest payment that would have been due on the
October 1, 2016 Interest Payment Date will become due on December 31, 2016, unless the Purchaser demands earlier payment. 

On July 8, 2016, the 2015 Warrant for 26,190,476
shares was fully exercised at a price of $0.012 per share for a total of $314,286, see above. The Company revalued the warrants
on the modification date at the new exercise price and recorded an additional expense of approximately $21,000 related to the incremental
increase in value (See Note 6).

Pursuant to the August Letter Agreement,
the Maturity Date of the Debenture was extended until February 28, 2017 and will not accrue interest from October 28, 2016 through
the Maturity Date (provided that all accrued but unpaid interest prior to October 28, 2016 (the original maturity date) shall be
due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Debenture). 

The Debenture is convertible at any time,
in whole or in part, at the Purchaser s option into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.03 per share;
provided that in the event that the volume weighted average price per share on any trading day is less than such conversion price,
the conversion price will be adjusted to a price per share that is equal to a 22.5% discount to the lowest trading price of the
Common Stock in the 10 trading days prior to the date of conversion. At no time will the Purchaser be entitled to convert any portion
of the Debenture to the extent that after such conversion, the Purchaser (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own
more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such date. 

Warrants  

Pursuant to the August Letter Agreement
and in consideration for extending the Maturity Date of the Debenture as noted above, the Company issued the Purchaser warrants
to purchase up to 240,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the  2016 Warrants ). The 2016 Warrants entitle the holder thereof
to purchase (i) up to 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.012 to $0.020 per share (the  Five
Month Warrant ), and (ii) up to 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share (the  Two
Year Warrant ). The Company also agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC, to register for resale the 240,000,000
shares of Common Stock underlying the 2016 Warrants. The Company calculated the 240,000,000 warrants at relative fair value, which
was $910,178 and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debenture in accordance with ASC 470-50-40-17. 

The 2016 Warrants are immediately exercisable.
On August 18, 2016, the Purchaser notified us of its exercise of 12,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the first tranche of the
Five Month Warrant at a purchase price of $0.012 per share or $150,000 in the aggregate (See Note 6). 

Pursuant to the Five Month Warrant, if
the Volume Weighted Average Price (as defined in the Five Month Warrant) of the Common Stock for five consecutive days equals or
exceeds the exercise price of any tranche of the Five Month Warrant (each, as applicable, a  Callable Tranche ), and
provided that the Company is in compliance with the Call Conditions as defined in the August Letter Agreement, the Company has
the right to call on the Purchaser to exercise any warrants under a Callable Tranche up to an aggregate exercise price of $350,000.
The Five Month Warrant generally limits the Company to one such call within a twenty trading day period. However, if the Volume
Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for five consecutive trading days is at least 200% of the exercise price of any warrants
under a Callable Tranche, the Company may make an additional call for the exercise of additional warrants under such Callable Tranche
up to an aggregate exercise price of $600,000 prior to the passage of the twenty trading day period. If Delafield does not exercise
the 2016 Warrants under a Callable Tranche when called by the Company under the terms of the August Letter Agreement, we may, at
our option, cancel any or all outstanding warrants under the Five Month Warrant. 

The exercise price and number of shares
of the Common Stock issuable under the 2016 Warrants are subject to adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations and pro
rata distributions. Any adjustment to the exercise price shall similarly cause the number of shares underlying the 2016 Warrants
to be adjusted so that the total value of the 2016 Warrants may increase. 

The Purchaser is subject to a beneficial

Additional
Issuance Debenture  

As of September 13, 2016, the Company entered
into an Additional Issuance Agreement (the  Additional Issuance Agreement ) with the Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement. Pursuant to the Additional Issuance Agreement, Delafield agreed to loan an additional $150,000 in exchange for a 5%
Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture of the Company in the principal amount of $165,000 (the  Additional
Issuance Debenture ). An aggregate total of $199,585 of this note was bifurcated with the embedded conversion option recorded
as a derivative liability at fair value (See Note 10). As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded accrued interest of $2,063. 

The rights and obligations of the Purchaser
and the Company with respect to the Additional Issuance Debenture and the shares of Common Stock issuable under the Additional
Issuance Debenture (the  New Underlying Shares ) are identical in all respects to the rights and obligations of the
Purchaser and the Company with respect to the Debenture and the shares of Common Stock issued and issuable thereunder, except that
the Purchaser will not receive any registration rights with respect to the New Underlying Shares and except as otherwise noted
in the governing documents. 

The Additional Issuance Agreement contains
customary representations, warranties and covenants by, among and for the benefit of the parties. We also agreed to pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred or sustained
by the Purchaser, in connection with the transaction. 

The Additional Issuance Debenture has a
10% original issue discount and matures on September 13, 2017. The principal amount of the Additional Issuance Debenture accrues
interest at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash (or if certain conditions are met, in stock at the Company s
option) on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The Additional Issuance Debenture is convertible at any time, in whole or
in part, at Delafield s option into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.03 (subject to adjustment) (the
 Conversion Price ). If the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock on any trading day is less than the then-current
Conversion Price, the Purchaser may convert at a price per share equal to a twenty two and one half percent (22.5%) discount to
the lowest trading price of the Common Stock in the ten trading days prior to the date of conversion. 

The Purchaser is subject to the same ownership
limitation in connection with the Additional Issuance Debenture as for the 2016 Warrants as described above. The Additional Issuance
Debenture includes customary event of default provisions and provides for a default interest rate of 18%. Upon the occurrence of
an event of default, the Purchaser may convert the Additional Issuance Debenture into shares of Common Stock at a price per share
equal to a thirty percent (30%) discount to the average volume weighted average price of the shares for the three trading days
prior to conversion. 

Subject to the conditions set forth in
the Additional Issuance Debenture, we have the right at any time after the earlier of (i) the six month anniversary of the original
issuance of the Additional Issuance Debenture or (ii) the date on which the New Underlying Shares are registered pursuant to an
effective registration statement, to redeem some or all of the total outstanding amount then remaining under the Additional Issuance
Debenture in cash at a price equal to 125% of the total amount of the Additional Issuance Debenture outstanding on the twentieth
(20th) trading date following the date the Company delivers notice of such redemption to Delafield.

At the sole election of the Purchaser,
in lieu of receiving a cash payment for any principal amounts due on the Additional Issuance Debenture, the Purchaser may use all
or any portion of any principal amounts owed to it to exercise outstanding warrants of the Company held by the Purchaser. 

The issuance of the Additional Issuance
Debenture to the Purchaser under the Additional Issuance Agreement was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act pursuant to the exemption for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The Company made this determination based on the representations of
the Purchaser that it was acquiring the Additional Issuance Debenture for its own account with no intent to distribute the Additional
Issuance Debenture. No general solicitation or general advertising was used in connection with the sale of the Additional Issuance
Debenture and the Company had a pre-existing relationship with the Purchaser. 

Our obligations under the Additional Issuance
Debenture are secured by an unconditional and continuing, first priority security interest in all of the assets and property (as
originally stated in the October 2015 agreement) of the Company until ten days following such time as the equity conditions set
forth in the Additional Issuance Debenture are met, pursuant to the terms of the existing Security Agreement. 

The Company recorded $165,000 of debt
discounts related to the above note issuances during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The debt discounts are being amortized
over the term of the debt. Amortization of all debt discounts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $444,835
and $186,935, respectively.

The Company previously
expanded by the filing of an international PCT patent application (No. PCT/AU2010/001403) directed to enhanced pro-enzyme formulations
and combination therapies. The international PCT application has been based on previous provisional patent applications capturing
the Company s ongoing research and development in this area. 

The Company received grant status in South
Africa and more recently in Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and New Zealand.  In addition, the United States Patent
and Trademark Office or USPTO and European Patent Office or EPO have made preliminary indications that key features of our technology
are patentable.  The Company is presently working towards securing a patent in each region, covering as many aspects of its
technology as possible, while also actively seeking protection throughout Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. Individual countries
and regions, include the United States, Canada, Brazil, China, Mexico, Hong Kong, Israel, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, Europe,
Russia, India and South Korea. The patent is granted in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. 

In addition to the Company s lead

NOTE 10 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS and FAIR VALUE
MEASUREMENTS  

Derivative
Financial Instruments:  

The Company applies
the provisions of ASC Topic 815-40,  Contracts in Entity s Own Equity  ( ASC Topic 815-40 ), under
which convertible instruments and warrants, which contain terms that protect holders from declines in the stock price (reset provisions),
may not be exempt from derivative accounting treatment. As a result, warrants and embedded conversion options in convertible debt
are recorded as a liability and are revalued at fair value at each reporting date. If the fair value of the warrants exceeds the
face value of the related debt, the excess is recorded as change in fair value in operations on the issuance date. The Company
has 3,000,000 warrants and $1,679,194 of convertible debt with repricing options outstanding at September 30, 2016. 

The Company calculates
the estimated fair values of the liabilities for derivative instruments using the Black Scholes ( BSM ) option pricing
model. Along with the below BSM value, the Company also computed the fair value using the Monte-Carlo model noting no material
difference between the valuations. The closing price of the Company s common stock at September 30, 2016 was $0.0138. Volatility,
expected remaining term and risk free interest rates used to estimate the fair value of derivative liabilities at September 30,
2016, are indicated in the table that follows. The volatility was based on historical volatility at September 30, 2016, the expected
term is equal to the remaining term of the warrants and the risk free rate is based upon rates for treasury securities with the
same term.

On October 21,
2016, pursuant to a conversion notice, $50,000 of principal was converted at $0.00775 into 6,451,613 shares of common stock. 

On October 27, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement with a third party for professional services over a six month period commencing on October 10, 2016 in exchange
for a monthly fee of $22,500, of which $10,000 a month is in cash and $12,500 per month is in shares of common stock. Additionally,
the Company acknowledges an existing outstanding balance due of $20,500 for September services. 

On October 31, 2016, the Company entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Eagle SPA ), with Eagle Equities, LLC ( Eagle Equities ), pursuant
to which Eagle Equities purchased two 8% convertible redeemable junior subordinated promissory notes, each in the principal amount
of $100,000. The first note (the  First Note ) was funded with cash and the second note (the  Eagle Back-End
Note ) was initially paid for by an offsetting promissory note issued by Eagle Equities to the Company (the  Note
Receivable ). The terms of the Eagle Back-End Note require cash funding prior to any conversion thereunder. The Note Receivable
is due June 30, 2017, unless certain conditions are not met, in which case both the Eagle Back-End Note and the Note Receivable
may both be cancelled. Both the First Note and the Eagle Back-End Note have a maturity date one year from the date of issuance
upon which any outstanding principal and interest is due and payable. The amounts cash funded plus accrued interest under both
the First Note and the Eagle Back-End Note are convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to 60% of the lowest
closing bid price of the Common Stock for the ten trading days prior to the conversion, subject to adjustment in certain events. 

The First Note may be prepaid with certain
penalties within 180 days of issuance. The Eagle Back-End Note may not be prepaid. However, in the event the First Note is redeemed
within the first six months of issuance, the Eagle Back-End Note will be deemed cancelled and of no further effect. 

The Eagle Back-End Note will not be cash
funded and such note, along with the Note Receivable, will be immediately cancelled if the shares do not maintain a minimum trading
price during the five days prior to such funding and a certain aggregate dollar trading volume during such period. Upon an event
of default, principal and accrued interest will become immediately due and payable under the notes. Additionally, upon an event
of default, both notes will accrue interest at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or the highest rate of interest permitted
by law. Further, certain events of default may trigger penalty and liquidated damage provisions. 

Since the Eagle Back-End Note is not convertible
until the Note Receivable is paid, and the Note Receivable and Eagle Back-End Note have a right of setoff, the Note Receivable
and Eagle Back-End Note and related accrued interest receivable and payable will be netted for purposes of presentation on the
balance sheet. 

On November 9, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement (the  November Agreement ) to adjust the exercise price of a warrant, issued September 30, 2013,
to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company.  Under the terms of the November Agreement, the exercise price
for the shares underlying the warrant was reduced to $0.015 AUD or $0.0115 USD per share.  The November Agreement did not
affect the remaining terms of the warrant. 

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The information
set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A )
contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the  PSLRA ), and are made in reliance upon the protections provided by such act for
forward-looking statements. Such statements may include, among others (i) expected changes in Propanc Health Group Corporation's
(referred to herein as the  Company,   Propanc,   we,   our,   ours  and  us )
revenues and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking
statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of terms such as  may,   will,   estimate,   continue, 
 plan,   believe,   anticipate,   intend,  or  expect  and other similar
words. The ultimate correctness of these forward-looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events
and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements.  

The following
important factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing those results and events to differ materially
from those views expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: our ability to successfully remediate material weaknesses
in our internal controls; our ability to reach research and development milestones as planned and within proposed budgets; our
ability to control costs; our ability to successfully implement our expansion strategies; our ability to obtain adequate new financing;
our ability to successfully develop and market our technologies; our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection; our ability
to recruit employees and directors with accounting and finance expertise; our dependence on third parties for services; our dependence
on key executives; the impact of government regulations, including FDA regulations; the impact of any future litigation; the availability
of capital and other economic, business and competitive factors.   

All forward-looking
statements included in this report are made only as of the date of this report or as indicated. We undertake no obligation to update
or correct these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking
statements, except as required by law.

the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report as well as the information under the heading  Risk
Factors  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  

Notwithstanding the above, Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, expressly states that the safe harbor for forward looking statements does not
apply to companies that issue penny stocks. Accordingly, the safe harbor for forward looking statements under the PSLRA is not
currently available to the Company because we are an issuer of penny stock.

Overview  

Propanc PTY Ltd.,
was incorporated in Melbourne, Victoria Australia on October 15, 2007, and is based in Camberwell, Victoria Australia. 

On November 23,
2010, Propanc Health Group Corporation (the  Company,   we,   us,   our ) was
incorporated in the state of Delaware. In January 2011, Propanc Health Group Corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares
of Propanc PTY Ltd. on a one-for-one basis making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. 

We are a development healthcare company
that is currently focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancer.
Together with our scientific and oncology consultants, we have developed a rational, composite formulation of anti-cancer compounds,
which together exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading through the body. Our
leading products are variations upon our novel formulation and involve or employ pro-enzymes, which are inactive precursors of
enzymes. As a result of positive early indications of the anti-cancer effects of our technology, we intend to submit our pro-enzyme
treatment to the rigorous, formal non-clinical and clinical development and trial processes required to obtain the regulatory approval
necessary to commercialize it and any product(s) derived and/or to be derived therefrom. 

In the near term, we intend to target patients
with limited remaining therapeutic options for the treatment of solid tumors such as colorectal, ovarian or pancreatic tumors.  
In the future, we intend to develop our lead product to treat early stage cancer and pre-cancerous diseases and as a preventative
measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening. 

We have generated
no revenue, have no cancer treatment products available to market and have no products which have reached the clinical trial stage.  We
require substantial additional financing to develop our products.  

Recent Developments  

Delafield Financing   

On October 28, 2015, we entered into a
securities purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), with Delafield Investments Limited ( Delafield ),
that provided for the investment of $4,000,000 (the  Investment Amount ) in exchange for a Convertible Debenture (the
 Debenture ) in the principal amount of $4,400,000 and warrant (the  2015 Warrant ) to purchase an aggregate
of 26,190,476 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the  Common Stock ), for an exercise price of $0.012
per share for a period of four years from such date. We and Delafield have since modified the terms of the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement pursuant to an addendum dated March 11, 2016 (the  Addendum ), a letter agreement dated
July 1, 2016 (the  July Letter Agreement ), and a letter agreement dated August 3, 2016 (the  August Letter
Agreement ). The descriptions of the Debenture, the 2015 Warrant and the 2016 Warrants below reflect the terms of such agreements
under the Purchase Agreement as modified by the Addendum, the July Letter Agreement and the August Letter Agreement. 

In connection with the Purchase Agreement,
we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on November 23, 2015, deemed effective on December 10, 2015, pursuant to which we
registered for resale an aggregate of 98,404,985 shares of Common Stock consisting of: (i) 72,214,509 shares underlying the Debenture;
and (ii) 26,190,476 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the 2015 Warrant (the  November Registration Statement ). 

Under the terms of the Debenture, we received
a reduction in the principal amount of the financing of (i) $25,000 upon the Company s filing of the November 2015 Registration
Statement within the time period specified and (ii) $25,000 upon the effectiveness of the November Registration Statement within
the time period specified. The current aggregate principal amount was adjusted to $4,350,000 upon the date of the November Registration
Statement and $1,514,194 as of September 30, 2016 (the  Principal Amount ) was outstanding. Any references to the  principal
amount  or the defined term  Principal Amount  used in this registration statement shall refer to the reduced
Principal Amount as described herein. 

Pursuant to the Addendum, on March 24,
2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1, deemed effective on April 18, 2016, to register for resale up to 171,000,000
additional shares of Common Stock underlying the Debenture. 

Debenture   

The Debenture has a 10% original issue
discount. The Principal Amount of the Debenture accrues interest at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash (or if
certain conditions are met, in stock at the Company s option) on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. Pursuant to the
July Letter Agreement, the Company and Delafield agreed to modify the July 1, 2016  Interest Payment Date  and the
October 1, 2016  Interest Payment Date  as such terms are defined in the Debenture. Pursuant to the July Letter Agreement,
the Company may delay the interest payment due on the July 1, 2016 Interest Payment Date by a minimum of 30 calendar days (the
 Minimum Extension Date ) and up to 60 calendar days, provided that Delafield may demand payment any time after the
Minimum Extension Date. The Company also may delay the interest payment due on the October 1, 2016 Interest Payment Date to the
Maturity Date unless Delafield demands earlier payment. 

Pursuant to the August Letter Agreement,
the maturity date of the Debenture was extended until February 28, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ) and will not accrue interest
from October 28, 2016 through the Maturity Date (provided that all accrued but unpaid interest prior to October 28, 2016 (the original
maturity date) shall be due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Debenture). 

The Debenture is convertible at any time,
in whole or in part, at Delafield s option into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.03 per share; provided
that in the event that the volume weighted average price per share on any trading day is less than such conversion price, the conversion
price will be adjusted to a price per share that is equal to a 22.5% discount to the lowest trading price of the Common Stock in
the 10 trading days prior to the date of conversion. At no time will Delafield be entitled to convert any portion of the Debenture
to the extent that after such conversion, Delafield (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such date. 

2015 Warrant   

Pursuant to the July Letter Agreement,
Delafield agreed to exercise the 2015 Warrant with respect to all 26,190,476 shares of Common Stock underlying the 2015 Warrant.
In consideration of such exercise, the Company agreed to adjust the exercise price from $0.60 per share to $0.012 per share, for
an aggregate exercise price of $314,286. 

2016 Warrants   

Pursuant to the August Letter Agreement
and in consideration for extending the Maturity Date of the Debenture, we issued to Delafield warrants to purchase up to 240,000,000
shares of Common Stock (the  2016 Warrants ). The 2016 Warrants entitle the holder thereof to purchase (i) up to 200,000,000
shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.012 to $0.020 per share (the  Five Month Warrant ), and (ii)
up to 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share (the  Two Year Warrant ). We also agreed
to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), to register for resale the
240,000,000 shares of Common Stock underlying the 2016 Warrants. 

The 2016 Warrants are immediately exercisable.
On August 18, 2016, Delafield notified us of its exercise of 12,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the first tranche of the Five
Month Warrant at a purchase price of $0.012 per share or $150,000 in the aggregate. 

Pursuant to the Five Month Warrant, if
the Volume Weighted Average Price (as defined in the Five Month Warrant) of the Common Stock for five consecutive days equals or
exceeds the exercise price of any tranche of the Five Month Warrant (each, as applicable, a  Callable Tranche ), and
provided that the Company is in compliance with the Call Conditions as defined in the August Letter Agreement, the Company has
the right to call on Delafield to exercise any warrants under a Callable Tranche up to an aggregate exercise price of $350,000.
The Five Month Warrant generally limits the Company to one such call within a twenty trading day period. However, if the Volume
Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for five consecutive trading days is at least 200% of the exercise price of any warrants
under a Callable Tranche, the Company may make an additional call for the exercise of additional warrants under such Callable Tranche
up to an aggregate exercise price of $600,000 prior to the passage of the twenty trading day period. If Delafield does not exercise
the 2016 Warrants under a Callable Tranche when called by the Company under the terms of the August Letter Agreement, we may, at
our option, cancel any or all outstanding warrants under the Five Month Warrant. 

The exercise price and number of shares
of the Common Stock issuable under the 2016 Warrants are subject to adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations and pro
rata distributions. Any adjustment to the exercise price shall similarly cause the number of shares underlying the 2016 Warrants
to be adjusted so that the total value of the 2016 Warrants may increase. 

Delafield is subject to a beneficial ownership
limitation under the 2016 Warrants such that the Company and Delafield will not affect any exercise of the 2016 Warrants that would
cause Delafield (together with its affiliates) to beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to the exercise of the warrant. Delafield, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease
the beneficial ownership limitation, provided that the beneficial ownership limitation may not exceed 9.99% of the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise of the warrant. 

The Five Month Warrant requires us to file
a registration statement covering the resale of the shares underlying the warrant within 15 days after August 3, 2016, and to use
our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC promptly thereafter and to
remain effective for a period of at least twelve months from the date of effectiveness. In the event that a registration statement
registering the resale of the shares underlying the Five Month Warrant is not effective on or before October 15, 2016, or is not
maintained effective thereafter, the termination date of the Five Month Warrant will be extended until such date that the shares
have been registered for at least a period of 90 days, but in no event later than April 30, 2017. 

The Two Year Warrant requires us to file
a registration statement covering the resale of the shares underlying the warrant within 15 days after August 3, 2016, and to use
our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC promptly thereafter and to
remain effective for a period of at least three years from the date of effectiveness. 

Additional Issuance Debenture   

As of September 13, 2016, we entered into
an Additional Issuance Agreement (the  Additional Issuance Agreement ) with Delafield pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. 
Pursuant to the Additional Issuance Agreement, Delafield agreed to loan an additional $150,000 in exchange for a 5% Original Issue
Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture of the Company in the principal amount of $165,000 (the  Additional Issuance
Debenture ). The rights and obligations of Delafield and us with respect to the Additional Issuance Debenture and the shares
of Common Stock issuable under the Additional Issuance Debenture (the  New Underlying Shares ) are identical in all
respects to the rights and obligations of Delafield and of the Company with respect to the Debenture and the shares of Common Stock
issued and issuable thereunder, except that Delafield will not receive any registration rights with respect to the New Underlying
Shares and except as otherwise noted in the governing documents. 

The Additional Issuance Agreement contains
customary representations, warranties and covenants by, among and for the benefit of the parties. We also agreed to pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred or sustained
by Delafield, in connection with the transaction. 

The Additional Issuance Debenture has a
10% original issue discount and matures on September 13, 2017. The principal amount of the Additional Issuance Debenture accrues
interest at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash (or if certain conditions are met, in stock at the Company s
option) on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The Additional Issuance Debenture is convertible at any time, in whole or
in part, at Delafield s option into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.03 (subject to adjustment) (the
 Conversion Price ). If the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock on any trading day is less than the then-current
Conversion Price, Delafield may convert at a price per share equal to a twenty two and one half percent (22.5%) discount to the
lowest trading price of the Common Stock in the ten trading days prior to the date of conversion. 

Delafield is subject to the same ownership
limitation in connection with the Additional Issuance Debenture as for the 2016 Warrants as described above. The Additional Issuance
Debenture includes customary event of default provisions and provides for a default interest rate of 18%. Upon the occurrence of
an event of default, Delafield may convert the Additional Issuance Debenture into shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal
to a thirty percent (30%) discount to the average volume weighted average price of the shares for the three trading days prior
to conversion. 

Subject to the conditions set forth in the Additional Issuance
Debenture, we have the right at any time after the earlier of (i) the six month anniversary of the original issuance of the Additional
Issuance Debenture or (ii) the date on which the New Underlying Shares are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement,
to redeem some or all of the total outstanding amount then remaining under the Additional Issuance Debenture in cash at a price
equal to 125% of the total amount of the Additional Issuance Debenture outstanding on the twentieth (20 th ) trading date
following the date the Company delivers notice of such redemption to Delafield. 

At the sole election of Delafield, in lieu
of receiving a cash payment for any principal amounts due on the Additional Issuance Debenture, Delafield may use all or any portion
of any principal amounts owed to it to exercise outstanding warrants of the Company held by Delafield. 

The issuance of the Additional Issuance
Debenture to the Purchaser under the Additional Issuance Agreement was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act pursuant to the exemption for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act. The Company made this determination based on the representations of Delafield that it was acquiring the Additional Issuance
Debenture for its own account with no intent to distribute the Additional Issuance Debenture. No general solicitation or general
advertising was used in connection with the sale of the Additional Issuance Debenture and the Company had a pre-existing relationship
with Delafield. 

Our obligations under the Additional Issuance
Debenture are secured by an unconditional and continuing, first priority security interest in all of the assets and property of
the Company until ten days following such time as the equity conditions set forth in the Additional Issuance Debenture are met,
pursuant to the terms of the existing Security Agreement. 

Agreement with Q-Biologicals NV  

We entered into a
Manufacturing Services Agreement (the  MSA ) and Quality Assurance Agreement (the  QAA ), each with an
effective date of August 12, 2016, with Q-Biologicals NV ( Q-Biologicals ), a contract manufacturing organization located
in Belgium. Pursuant to the MSA, Q-Biologicals will produce certain drug substances and product containing certain enzymes at its
facility in Belgium. We will use these substances and products for development purposes, including but not limited to clinical
trials. The MSA contemplates payment to Q-Biologicals pursuant to a pre-determined fee schedule based on the completion of certain
milestones that depend on our manufacturing requirements and final batch yield. We anticipate that our payments to Q-Biologicals
under the MSA will range between $2.5 million and $5.0 million over five years, with the majority of the expenditures occurring
during the first two years of the MSA when the finished drug product is manufactured and released for clinical trials, including
a pre-payment to Q-Biologicals of approximately $144,000, which has yet to be made. 

The MSA shall continue
for a term of three years unless extended by mutual agreement in writing. We can terminate the MSA early for any reason upon the
required notice period, however, in such event, the pre-payment paid upon signing the MSA is considered non-refundable. The QAA
sets forth the parties respective obligations and responsibilities relating to the manufacturing and testing of the products under
the MSA. 

The agreements with Q-Biologicals contain certain customary representations, warranties and limitations of liabilities,
and confidentiality and indemnity obligations. 

Completion of 28 Day Toxicology Study  

On October 25, 2016,
we announced the completion of a 28 day toxicokinetic study to support a determination of a safe starting dose in patients in progression
towards clinical trials for our lead product, PRP. Data from the Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) compliant, 28 day
repeat dose toxicokinetic study will form the basis of a clinical trial application in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the study
was to evaluate the toxicokinetic parameters of PRP following repeated, daily intravenous tail vein administration in rats and
to evaluate distribution and bioavailability of the test articles over an extended period. In addition, the pharmacological properties
and bioavailability of the treatment before and after repeat exposure were also evaluated. Data generated from this study will
define conditions for a planned four-week regulatory GLP compliant toxicology study. 

Eagle Equities Financing   

On October 31, 2016,
we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Eagle Equities, LLC ( Eagle Equities ), pursuant to which Eagle
Equities purchased two 8% convertible redeemable junior subordinated promissory notes for an aggregate of $200,000. For additional
information regarding the transaction with Eagle Equities, please see the disclosure under  Item 5. Other Information 
in this report. 

Critical Accounting
Estimates  

Below is a discussion of our more subjective
accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining (i) the methodology used in calculating the estimates, (ii) the inherent
uncertainties pertaining to such estimates and (iii) the possible effects of a significant variance in actual experience, from
that of the estimate, on the Company s financial condition. Estimates involve numerous assumptions that, if incorrect, could
create a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 

Foreign Currency
Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss) : The Company s functional currency is the AUD. For financial reporting
purposes, the AUD has been translated into USD as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange
rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during
the reporting period. Equity transactions are translated at each historical transaction date spot rate. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders  equity
(deficit) as  accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as other income (expense). 

Accounting
for Income Taxes:  The Company is governed by Australia and United States income tax laws, which are administered by the
Australian Taxation Office and the United States Internal Revenue Service, respectively. The Company follows FASB ASC 740 when
accounting for income taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statements and
tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and
rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable
for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

The Company adopted
provisions of ASC 740, Sections 25 through 60,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  These sections provide
detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in
the financial statements. Tax positions must meet a  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold at the effective date
to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740 and in subsequent periods. 

Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation : The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Stock
Compensation  and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB 107) issued by the SEC in March 2005 regarding its interpretation
of ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an
expense over the related requisite service period. The statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the
fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption. The Company values any employee or non-employee
stock based compensation at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. 

The Company accounts
for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50  Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.  

Derivative Instruments : ASC Topic
815,  Derivatives and Hedging  ( ASC Topic 815 ), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair
value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss) depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify and have been designated for
hedge accounting treatment. The Company does not have any derivative instruments for which it has applied hedge accounting treatment. 

Convertible Notes With Variable Conversion
Options : The Company has entered into convertible notes, some of which contain variable conversion options, whereby the outstanding
principal and accrued interest may be converted, by the holder, into common shares at a fixed discount to the price of the common
stock at the time of conversion. The Company treats these convertible notes as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and measures the
fair value of the notes at the time of issuance, which is the result of the share price discount at the time of conversion, and
records the put premium as accretion to interest expense to the date of first conversion. 

Research and Development Tax Credits : The
Company may apply for Research and Development tax concessions with the Australian Taxation Office on an annual basis. Although
the amount is possible to estimate at year end, the Australian Taxation Office may reject or materially alter the claim amount.
Accordingly, the Company does not recognize the benefit of the claim amount until cash receipt since collectability is not certain
until such time. The tax concession is a refundable credit. If the Company has net income then the Company can receive the credit
which reduces its income tax liability. If the Company has net losses, then the Company may still receive a cash payment for the
credit, however, the Company's net operating loss carry forwards are reduced by the gross equivalent loss that would produce the
credit amount when the income tax rate is applied to that gross amount. The concession is recognized as an income tax benefit,
in operations, upon receipt.

Pronouncements  

Reference is
made to  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  under Note 1 of the Unaudited Condensed Notes to the Unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements. 

Results of
Operations  

The following
discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q. The results discussed below are of the Company and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Propanc Pty
Ltd. 

For the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated no revenue because we are currently undertaking research and development
activities for market approval and there were no sales generated in this period. 

Administration
Expense  

Administration
expenses increased to $1,004,503 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $848,979 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in stock based expenses of approximately
$125,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase
in stock based expenses was a result of $498,000 of compensation in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to an officer and
director of the Company offset by a decrease of approximately $340,000 of stock compensation to consultants in the three months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Occupancy Expense  

Occupancy expense
increased by approximately $3,659 to $8,597 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. On May 4, 2016, the Company
entered into a new five-year operating lease agreement with a related party with monthly rent of $3,300 AUD, inclusive of GST.
The increase relates to the final payment for the old lease during the quarter and three months of lease expense for the new space
during the quarter. 

Research and
Development Expenses  

Research and development
was $161,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $153,474 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Research and development expenditures are primarily attributable to completing animal efficacy models on PRP and
to completing the manufacturing, production of drug substance and product for preclinical and clinical trials, as well as undertaking
formal toxicology studies and non clinical development. 

Interest Expense/Income  

Interest expense
increased to $471,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $418,644 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.  Interest expense is primarily comprised of $445,000 debt discount amortization and $21,000 in revised warrant
valuations. This decrease is primarily attributable to fewer convertible notes with discounted debt features issued by the Company
during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Change in Fair
Value of Derivative Liabilities  

Change in fair
value of derivative liabilities decreased by $426,480 to a gain of $369,373 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $795,853 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the issuance
of convertible notes with repricing options and variable conversion pricing and a decrease in our stock price during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Foreign Currency
Transaction Gain (Loss)  

Foreign currency
transaction gain (loss) increased to a gain of $173,989 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a loss of
$210,739 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in foreign currency transaction gain (loss) is primarily
attributable to a stronger US Dollar versus the Australian Dollar and increased operating activities in Australia during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net loss  

Net loss increased
to $1,101,969 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $838,894 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a $167,000 increase in operating expenses as well as the net affect of fluctuations
within interest expense/income, changes in fair value of derivative liabilities and foreign currency transactions gains. 

Liquidity and
Capital Resources  

Net cash used
in operations was $683,598 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $405,712 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.  This fluctuation relates to changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, a stock option expense paid
to an officer and director of approximately $500,000 in addition to fluctuations in changes related to the valuation of new derivative
liabilities and the revaluation of existing derivative liabilities offset by the amortization of the debt discount related to the
Delafield debenture in the three months ending September 30, 2016. 

Net cash used in investing activities was
$0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $679 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company
purchased equipment in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Cash flows provided
by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $614,286 compared to $415,338 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had proceeds from convertible promissory notes
of approximately $150,000 and proceeds from the exercise of warrants of approximately $464,000. During the three months ended September
30, 2015, we had proceeds from convertible promissory notes of approximately $552,500, offset by repayments of convertible promissory
notes of $104,000 and repayments of other loans of approximately $33,000. 

The effect of the exchange rate on cash resulted in a $26,845 negative adjustment to cash flows in the
three months ending September 30, 2016 compared to a negative adjustment of $39,116 to cash flows in the three months ending September
30, 2015. The reason for the fluctuation is due to the application of translation rates throughout the cash flow statement, the
volume of transactions within each period and the daily fluctuation in exchange rates. 

We have substantial
capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had $24,913
in cash. Based upon our current business plans, we will need considerable cash investments to be successful.  Such capital
requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and for which we currently have commitments. We continue
to seek various sources of financing. Therefore, we presently do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the
next twelve months. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, this may affect our operations and ability to complete ongoing
activities in connection with our research and development programs. 

Related Party Transactions  

Since inception,
Propanc Health Group Corporation has conducted transactions with directors and director related entities. These transactions included
the following: 

As of September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company owed certain directors a total of $56,736 and $54,767, respectively, for money loaned to
the Company throughout the years. 

As of September
30, 2016 and June 30 2016, the Company owed two directors a total of $35,163 and $33,943, respectively, related to expenses paid
on behalf of the Company related to corporate startup costs and intellectual property. 

Going Concern
Qualification  

We have incurred
significant losses and cash used in operations, and such losses and use of cash are expected to continue. Our Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm has included a  Going Concern Qualification  in their report for the years ended June 30, 2016
and 2015.  In addition, we have negative working capital. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans include seeking additional capital or debt financing. There is no guarantee
that additional capital or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on
terms acceptable to us. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.  The  Going Concern Qualification  might make it substantially more difficult to raise
capital. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

With the participation
of James Nathanielsz, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon such evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

The Company is
undertaking to improve its internal control over financial reporting and improve its disclosure controls and procedures. As of
September 30, 2016, we identified the following material weaknesses that still exist through the date of this report: 

As of September
30, 2016 and as of the date of filing this report, we did not maintain effective controls over the disclosure control environment.
Specifically, the Board does not currently have a director who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item
407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. The Company also lacks accounting personnel with technical knowledge in certain debt and equity
transactions. Additionally, because of the size of the Company s administrative staff, controls related to the segregation
of certain duties have not been developed and the Company has not been able to adhere to them. Since these entity level programs
have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. 

Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There were no
changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

To the best of
our knowledge, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information
set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors 
in the Company s Annual Report of Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, as filed with the SEC. These factors could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could
cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements
contained in this report.

In each issuance for services or
pursuant to warrants, the Company claimed an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the
exemption for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company
made this determination based on representations of the acquiror that it was acquiring the securities for its own account with
no intent to distribute the securities. No general solicitation or general advertising were used in connection with these issuances.

Item 5. Other Information.  

On October 31, 2016, the Company entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Eagle Equities, LLC ( Eagle Equities ), pursuant to which Eagle Equities
purchased two 8% convertible redeemable junior subordinated promissory notes, each in the principal amount of $100,000. The first
note (the  First Note ) was funded with cash and the second note (the  Eagle Back-End Note ) was initially
paid for by an offsetting promissory note issued by Eagle Equities to the Company (the  Note Receivable ). The terms
of the Eagle Back-End Note require cash funding prior to any conversion thereunder. The Note Receivable is due June 30, 2017,
unless certain conditions are not met, in which case both the Eagle Back-End Note and the Note Receivable may both be cancelled.
Both the First Note and the Eagle Back-End Note have a maturity date one year from the date of issuance upon which any outstanding
principal and interest is due and payable. The amounts cash funded plus accrued interest under both the First Note and the Eagle
Back-End Note are convertible into Common Stock at a conversion price equal to 60% of the lowest closing bid price of the common
stock for the ten trading days prior to the conversion, subject to adjustment in certain events. 

The First Note may be prepaid with certain
penalties within 180 days of issuance. The Eagle Back-End Note may not be prepaid. However, in the event the First Note is redeemed
within the first six months of issuance, the Eagle Back-End Note will be deemed cancelled and of no further effect. 

The Eagle Back-End Note will not be cash
funded and such note, along with the Note Receivable, will be immediately cancelled if the shares do not maintain a minimum trading
price during the five days prior to such funding and a certain aggregate dollar trading volume during such period. Upon an event
of default, principal and accrued interest will become immediately due and payable under the notes. Additionally, upon an event
of default, both notes will accrue interest at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or the highest rate of interest permitted
by law. Further, certain events of default may trigger penalty and liquidated damage provisions.

 8% CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
NOTE 

 DUE OCTOBER 31, 2017 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,
Propanc Health Group Corp. (the  Company ) promises to pay to the order of EAGLE EQUITIES, LLC and its authorized successors
and Permitted Assigns, defined below, (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face amount of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars exactly (U.S. $100,000.00) on October 31, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and to pay interest on the principal
amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on October 31, 2016. The interest will be paid to the Holder
in whose name this Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of this Note. The principal
of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 525 Norton Parkway, New Haven, CT 06511, initially, and if changed, last appearing
on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest
payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less any amounts required by law to be
deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing
on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal
hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum represented by such
check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. Permitted
Assigns means any Holder assignment, transfer or sale of all or a portion of this Note accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel as
provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement by and between the Holder and the Company dated as of October
31, 2016 (the  Securities Purchase Agreement ). 

____  Initials             

The Holder, for itself
and its successors and assigns, agrees that this Note, and the payment of amounts due hereunder, are junior to and subordinate
in all respects to the existing debt of the Company pursuant to that certain 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible
Debenture with an original issue date of October 28, 2015 (the  2015 Debenture ), and the 5% Original Issue Discount
Senior Secured Convertible Debenture with an original issue date of September 13, 2016 (the  2016 Debenture ), in each
case issued by the Company to Delafield Investments Limited ( Delafield ), as amended, modified, supplemented, restated,
refinanced or replaced from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in the Securities Purchase Agreement or this Note,
no payment pursuant to this Note will occur until such time as the 2015 and Debenture and 2016 Debenture have been fully repaid.
Any delay in the payment hereunder as a result of this subordination will not trigger any right to rescind, penalty or event of
default hereunder. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1.       This
Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder
shall pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in connection therewith. To the extent that Holder subsequently transfers,
assigns, sells or exchanges any of the multiple lesser denomination notes, Holder acknowledges that it will provide the Company
with Opinions of Counsel as provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement ( Opinions of Counsel ). 

2.       The
Company shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3.       This
Note may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ), applicable
state securities laws and Sections 2(f) and 5(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying
party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of
the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all
other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice
to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition
to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prequalified prospective transferee of this Note, also is required to give
the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (  Notice of Conversion  ) in the form annexed
hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date. All notices of conversion will be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel. 

4.        (a) The Holder of this Note
is entitled, at its option, at any time, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding
into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common Stock  ) at a price (  Conversion Price  )
for each share of Common Stock equal to  60%  of the   lowest closing bid price   of the Common Stock as reported
on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the
Common Stock may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ), for the    ten    prior trading days including
the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered together
with an Opinion of Counsel, by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or
Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). For purposes of the above calculations, a day
shall not be considered a trading day if there was no trading volume for the Company s Common Stock for that particular day.
If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall
be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company
of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued, but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing
fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.
To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take
all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law.
The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill 
on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 50% instead of 60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  If
the Company fails to maintain the share reserve at the 4x  discount  of the note 60 days after the issuance of the note, the
conversion discount shall be increased by 10%. In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion,
along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 4.99% of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company (which may be increased up to 9.9% upon 60 days  prior written notice
by the Investor). 

(b)       Interest
on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in
Common Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest
Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a
portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 

(c)       The
Note may be prepaid with the following penalties: (i) if the note is prepaid within 60 days of the issuance date, then at 130%
of the face amount plus any accrued interest; (ii) if the note is prepaid after 60 days after the issuance date but less than 121
days after the issuance date, then at 140% of the face amount plus any accrued interest and (iii) if the note is prepaid after
120 days after the issuance date but less than 180 days after the issuance date, then at 150% of the face amount plus any accrued
interest. This Note may not be prepaid after the 180 th  day. Such redemption must be closed and funded within 3 days
of giving notice of redemption of the right to redeem shall be null and void. 

(d)        Upon
(i) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization (excluding an increase in authorized capital) or other change or
exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity (other
than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification,
conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii)
being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the election
of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion Price. 

(e)        In
case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection with which
this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note
shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of
stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, capital reorganization or other change,
consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the
Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash,
the value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or entity acting in good faith. 

5.       No
provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal
of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed. 

6.       The
Company hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of
dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for hereunder
and shall be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto. 

7.       The
Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder
in collecting any amount due under this Note. 

8.       If
one or more of the following described  Events of Default  shall occur: 

(a)       The
Company shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the Company;
or 

(b)       Any
of the representations or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements
heretofore or hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Note, or
the Securities Purchase Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any respect; or 

(c)       The
Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation of
the Company under this Note or any other note issued to the Holder; or 

(d)       The
Company shall (1) become insolvent (which does not include a  going concern opinion); (2) admit in writing its inability
to pay its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commence proceedings for its
dissolution; (4) apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator or receiver for its or for a substantial part
of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy relief, consent to the filing of such petition or have filed against
it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal or state laws as applicable; or 

(e)       A
trustee, liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for a substantial part of its property or business without
its consent and shall not be discharged within sixty (60) days after such appointment; or 

(f)       Any
governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of any governmental agency shall assume custody or control
of the whole or any substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or 

(g)       One
or more money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)
in the aggregate, shall be entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain unpaid,
unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
any proposed sale thereunder; or 

(h)       The
Company has defaulted on or breached any term of any other note of similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and
failed to cure such default within the appropriate grace period; or 

(i)       The
Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the OTC Markets exchange) or, if the Common Stock trades
on an exchange, then trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases to file its 1934
act reports with the SEC; 

(j)       The
Company shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4 herein without restrictive legend within 3 business
days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion which includes an Opinion of Counsel expressing an opinion which supports the removal
of a restrictive legend; or 

(k)        The
Company shall not replenish the reserve set forth in Section 12, within 3 business days of the request of the Holder. 

(l)       The
Company shall be delinquent in its periodic report filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or 

(m)        The
Company shall cause to lose the  bid  price for its stock in a market (including the OTC marketplace or other exchange). 

Then, or at any time thereafter, unless
cured within 5 days, and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been waived in writing by the Holder
(which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice
of any kind (other than notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything herein or in any note or other
instruments contained to the contrary notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any period of
grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law.
Upon an Event of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or, if such rate is usurious or not
permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section 8(j) the parties
agree that damages shall be difficult to determine and agree on liquidated damages in the amount of $250 per day the shares are
not issued beginning on the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company. The agreed liquidated
damages shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th  day. In the event of a breach of Section 8(m), the parties
agree that damages shall be difficult to determine and hereby agree to an increase of the outstanding principal amounts by 20%
as a liquidated damages payment. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the parties agree that damages will be difficult to determine
and agree that the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 50% as a liquidated damages payment. If this Note
is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(l)
occurs or is continuing after the 6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to use the lowest closing
bid price during the delinquency period as a base price for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during
the delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is 50% the Holder may elect to convert future conversions
at $0.005 per share. 

If the Holder shall commence an action
or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if the Holder prevails
in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses incurred
in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding. 

9.       In
case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and
the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

10.       Neither
this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the
Company and the Holder. 

11.       The
Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and that if it previously has been a  shell  issuer
that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported Form 10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell
issuer. 

12.       The
Company shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 66,006,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under
this Note (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any shares remaining in the Share Reserve shall
be cancelled. The company should at all times reserve a minimum of four times the amount of shares required if the note would be
fully converted.  The Holder may reasonably request increases from time to time to reserve such amounts. The Company will
instruct its transfer agent to provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its conversions. 

13.       The
Company will give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations
etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 

14.       This
Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be performed
within the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company
hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New York or in
the Federal courts sitting in the county or city of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile
transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as an original.

and Permitted Assigns, defined below, (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face amount of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars exactly (U.S. $100,000.00) on October 31, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and to pay interest on the principal
amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on October 31, 2016. The interest will be paid to the Holder

on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest
payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less any amounts required by law to be
deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing
on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal
hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum represented by such
check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. Permitted

provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and the Holder dated as of October

____  Initials             

The Holder, for itself
and its successors and assigns, agrees that this Note, and the payment of amounts due hereunder, are junior to and subordinate
in all respects to the existing debt of the Company pursuant to that certain 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible
Debenture with an original issue date of October 28, 2015 (the  2015 Debenture ), and the 5% Original Issue Discount
Senior Secured Convertible Debenture with an original issue date of September 13, 2016 (the  2016 Debenture ), in each
case issued by the Company to Delafield Investments Limited ( Delafield ), as amended, modified, supplemented, restated,
refinanced or replaced from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in the Securities Purchase Agreement or this Note,
no payment pursuant to this Note will occur until such time as the 2015 Debenture and 2016 Debenture have been fully repaid. Any
delay in the payment hereunder as a result of this subordination will not trigger any right to rescind, penalty or event of default
hereunder. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1.       This
Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder
shall pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in connection therewith. To the extent that Holder subsequently transfers,
assigns, sells or exchanges any of the multiple lesser denomination notes, Holder acknowledges that it will provide the Company
with Opinions of Counsel as provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement ( Opinions of Counsel ). 

2.       The
Company shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3.       This
Note may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ), applicable
state securities laws and Sections 2(f) and 5(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying
party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of
the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all
other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice
to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition
to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prequalified prospective transferee of this Note, also is required to give
the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (  Notice of Conversion  ) in the form annexed
hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date. All notices of conversion will be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel. 

4.        (a) The Holder of this Note
is entitled, at its option, at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note
then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common Stock  ) at a price (  Conversion
Price  ) for each share of Common Stock equal to  60%  of the   lowest closing bid price   of the Common
Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange
upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ), for the    ten    prior trading
days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered
together with an Opinion of Counsel, by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard
or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). For purposes of the above calculations, a
day shall not be considered a trading day if there was no trading volume for the Company s Common Stock for that particular
day. If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall
be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company
of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued, but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing
fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.
To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take
all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law.
The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill 
on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 50% instead of 60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  If
the Company fails to maintain the share reserve at the 4x  discount  of the note 60 days after the issuance of the note, the
conversion discount shall be increased by 10%. In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion,
along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 4.99% of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company (which may be increased up to 9.9% upon 60 days  prior written notice
by the Investor). 

(b)       Interest
on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in
Common Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest
Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a
portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 

(c)       This
Note may not be prepaid, except that if the $100,000 Rule 144 convertible redeemable note issued by the Company of even date herewith
is redeemed by the Company within 6 months of the issuance date of such Note, all obligations of the Company under this Note and
all obligations of the Holder under the Holder issued Back End Note will be automatically be deemed satisfied and this Note and
the Holder issued Back End Note will be automatically be deemed cancelled and of no further force or effect. 

(d)        Upon
(i) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization (excluding an increase in authorized capital) or other change or
exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity (other
than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification,
conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii)
being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the election
of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion Price. 

(e)        In
case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection with which
this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note
shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of
stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, capital reorganization or other change,
consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the
Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash,
the value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or entity acting in good faith. 

5.       No
provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal
of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed. 

6.       The
Company hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of
dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for hereunder
and shall be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto. 

7.       The
Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder
in collecting any amount due under this Note. 

8.       If
one or more of the following described  Events of Default  shall occur: 

(a)       The
Company shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the Company;
or 

(b)       Any
of the representations or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements
heretofore or hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Note, or
the Securities Purchase Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any respect; or 

(c)       The
Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation of
the Company under this Note or any other note issued to the Holder; or 

(d)       The
Company shall (1) become insolvent (which does not include a  going concern opinion); (2) admit in writing its inability
to pay its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commence proceedings for its
dissolution; (4) apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator or receiver for its or for a substantial part
of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy relief, consent to the filing of such petition or have filed against
it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal or state laws as applicable; or 

(e)       A
trustee, liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for a substantial part of its property or business without
its consent and shall not be discharged within sixty (60) days after such appointment; or 

(f)       Any
governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of any governmental agency shall assume custody or control
of the whole or any substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or 

(g)       One
or more money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)
in the aggregate, shall be entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain unpaid,
unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
any proposed sale thereunder; or 

(h)       The
Company has defaulted on or breached any term of any other note of similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and
failed to cure such default within the appropriate grace period; or 

(i)       The
Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the OTC Markets exchange) or, if the Common Stock trades
on an exchange, then trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases to file its 1934
act reports with the SEC; 

(j)       The
Company shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4 herein without restrictive legend within 3 business
days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion which includes an Opinion of Counsel expressing an opinion which supports the removal
of a restrictive legend; or 

(k)        The
Company shall not replenish the reserve set forth in Section 12, within 5 business days of the request of the Holder; or 

(l)        The
Company shall cease to be  current  in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or 

(m) The Company shall
lose the  bid  price for its stock in a market (including the OTC marketplace or other exchange) 

Then, or at any time thereafter, unless
cured, in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole discretion,
the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any
kind (other than notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything herein or in any note or other instruments
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any period of grace, enforce

Section 8(m), the parties agree that damages shall be difficult to determine and in lieu of a penalty, the parties agree to an
increase of the outstanding principal amounts by 20% as a liquidated damages payment. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the
parties agree that damages shall be difficult to determine and in lieu of a penalty, the parties agree to an increase of the outstanding
principal amounts by 50% as a liquidated damages payment. Further, if a breach of Section 8(l) occurs or is continuing after the
6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period
as a base price for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period is $0.01 per share
and the conversion discount is 50% the Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per share. If this Note is not
paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%. 

If the Holder shall commence an action
or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if the Holder prevails
in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses incurred
in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding. 

9.       In
case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and
the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

10.       Neither
this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the
Company and the Holder. 

11.       The
Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it previously
has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information
indicating it is no longer a  shell issuer. 

12.       Prior
to cash funding of this Note, The Company will issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 3x the number of shares
of Common Stock necessary to allow the holder to convert this note based on the discounted conversion price set forth in Section
4(a) herewith. Upon full conversion of this Note, the reserve representing this Note shall be cancelled. The Company will pay all
transfer agent costs associated with issuing and delivering the shares. If such amounts are to be paid by the Holder, it may deduct
such amounts from the Conversion Price. Conversion Notices may be sent to the Company or its transfer agent via electric mail.
The Company will instruct its transfer agent to provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its
conversions. 

13.       The
Company will give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations
etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 

14.       This
Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be performed
within the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company

in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, with full power and authority (corporate and other)
to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to carry on its business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted. 

b.        Authorization;
Enforcement . (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement, the
Notes and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to issue the Securities, in accordance with the terms
hereof and thereof, (ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes by the Company and the consummation by it of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including without limitation, the issuance of the Notes and the issuance and
reservation for issuance of the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof) have been duly authorized by the
Company s Board of Directors and no further consent or authorization of the Company, its Board of Directors, or its shareholders
is required, (iii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company by its authorized representative, and such
authorized representative is the true and official representative with authority to sign this Agreement and the other documents
executed in connection herewith and bind the Company accordingly, and (iv) this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery
by the Company of the Notes, each of such instruments will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms. 

 c.        Issuance
of Shares . The shares reserved for conversion of the Note shall be duly authorized and reserved for issuance as soon as practicable
after the Company has increased its shares of authorized Common Stock in an amount equal to or greater than that permitting it
to reserve such shares. Upon conversion of the Note in accordance with its respective terms, Conversion Shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof
and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Company and will not impose personal
liability upon the holder thereof. 

d.        Acknowledgment
of Dilution . The Company understands and acknowledges the potentially dilutive effect to the Common Stock upon the issuance
of the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the Notes. The Company further acknowledges that its obligation to issue Conversion
Shares upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with this Agreement and the Notes is absolute and unconditional regardless of
the dilutive effect that such issuance may have on the ownership interests of other shareholders of the Company. 

e.        No
Conflicts . The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Notes by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance and reservation for issuance
of the Conversion Shares) will not (i) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation
or By-laws, (ii) violate or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which
with notice or lapse of time or both could become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture, patent, patent license or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state
securities laws and regulations and regulations of any self-regulatory organizations to which the Company or its securities are
subject) applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
is bound or affected (except for such conflicts, defaults, terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect). All consents, authorizations, orders, filings
and registrations which the Company is required to obtain pursuant to the preceding sentence have been obtained or effected on
or prior to the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of the eligibility requirements of the OTC Markets Exchange (the  OTC
Markets ) and does not reasonably anticipate that the Common Stock will be ineligible for quotation on the OTC MARKETS in
the foreseeable future, nor are the Company s securities  chilled  by DTC. The Company and its subsidiaries are
unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to any of the foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement,  Material
Adverse Effect  means an event or combination of events, which individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to (a) adversely affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Agreement or the Notes, or (b) have or result in a material

subsidiaries, or their officers or directors in their capacity as such, that could have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3(f)
contains a complete list and summary description of any pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened proceeding against
or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries, without regard to whether it would have a Material Adverse Effect. 

g.        Acknowledgment

with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and any statement made by the Buyer or any of its respective
representatives or agents in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is not advice or a recommendation
and is merely incidental to the Buyer  purchase of the Securities.

Integrated Offering . Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf, has directly

applicable to the Company or its securities. 

e.        Breach
