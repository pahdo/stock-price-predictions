1.               Organization and Business 
  Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on August 22, 2013, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. On September 3, 2013, the Company was initially capitalized with the sale of   13,500   shares of common stock to Steadfast REIT Investments, LLC (the  Sponsor ) at a purchase price of   $15.00   per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $202,500  . Steadfast Apartment Advisor, LLC (the  Advisor ), a Delaware limited liability company formed on August 22, 2013, invested   $1,000   in the Company in exchange for   1,000   shares of non-participating, non-voting convertible stock (the  Convertible Stock ) as described in Note 6. 
  Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through Steadfast Apartment REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 27, 2013. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company and Steadfast Apartment REIT Limited Partner, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Limited Partnership Agreement (the  Partnership Agreement ) on September 3, 2013. As the Company accepted subscriptions for shares of its common stock, the Company transferred substantially all of the net offering proceeds from its Public Offering (defined below) to the Operating Partnership as a contribution in exchange for limited partnership interests and the Company s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership increased proportionately.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   34   multifamily properties comprising a total of   11,601   apartment homes. For more information on the Company s real estate portfolio, see Note 3. 
  Public Offering 
  On December 30, 2013, the Company commenced its initial public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), to offer a maximum of   66,666,667   shares of common stock for sale to the public at an initial price of   $15.00   per share (with discounts available for certain categories of purchasers) (the  Primary Offering ). The Company also registered up to   7,017,544   shares of common stock for sale pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan (the  DRP,  and together with the Primary Offering, the  Public Offering ) at an initial price of   $14.25   per share. The Company terminated its Public Offering on March 24, 2016, but continues to offer shares of common stock pursuant to the DRP. As of the termination of the Public Offering, the Company had sold   48,625,651   shares of common stock in the Public Offering for gross proceeds of   $724,849,631  , including   1,011,561   shares of common stock issued pursuant to the DRP for gross offering proceeds of   $14,414,752  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued   49,430,739   shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of   $736,437,314  , including   1,816,711   shares of common stock issued pursuant to the DRP for gross offering proceeds of   $26,002,435  . 
  On March 24, 2016, the Company s board of directors determined an estimated value per share of the Company s common stock of   $14.46   as of December 31, 2015. In connection with the determination of an estimated value per share, the Company s board of directors determined a price per share for the DRP of   $14.46  , effective May 1, 2016. The Company s board of directors may again, from time to time, in its sole discretion, change the price at which the Company offers shares pursuant to the DRP to reflect changes in the Company s estimated value per share and other factors that the Company s board of directors deems relevant.  
  The business of the Company is externally managed by the Advisor, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement dated December 13, 2013, by and among the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor (as amended, the  Advisory Agreement ). The Advisory Agreement is subject to annual renewal by the Company s board of directors.  The current term of the Advisory Agreement expires on December 13, 2017. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor manages the Company s day-to-day operations, manages the Company s portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets, sources and presents investment opportunities to the Company s board of directors and provides investment management services on the Company s behalf. The Advisor has also entered into an Advisory Services Agreement with Crossroads Capital Advisors, LLC

( Crossroads Capital Advisors ), whereby Crossroads Capital Advisors provides advisory services to the Company on behalf of the Advisor. The Company retained Steadfast Capital Markets Group, LLC (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Sponsor, to serve as the dealer manager for the Public Offering. The Dealer Manager was responsible for marketing the Company s shares of common stock offered pursuant to the Public Offering. The Advisor, along with the Dealer Manager, provides offering services, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on the Company s behalf.  
  The Partnership Agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that will enable the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership will not be classified as a  publicly traded partnership  for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ), which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by the Operating Partnership in acquiring and operating real properties, the Operating Partnership will pay all of the Company s administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of the Operating Partnership. 
  The Company commenced its real estate operations on May 22, 2014, upon acquiring a fee simple interest in a multifamily property located in Spring Hill, Tennessee. 
   
  2.               Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , other than adopting Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-03, as amended by ASU 2015-15, as further described below. For further information about the Company s accounting policies, refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016.  
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of the Company s subsidiaries are prepared using accounting policies consistent with those of the Company. 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, the financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results of such periods. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The unaudited consolidated financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

Fair Value Measurements 
  Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1:   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 
                
    Level 2:   quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3:   prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
     When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and will classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the Company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When the Company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the Company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, the Company uses several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and will establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. 
  The following describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified. 
  Interest rate cap agreements   - These derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair value was based on a model-driven valuation using the associated variable rate curve and an implied market volatility, both of which were observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the interest rate cap agreements. Therefore, the Company s interest rate cap agreements were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements are recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  The following tables reflect the Company s assets required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets:

Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rents and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, distributions payable, due to affiliates and notes payable.  
  The Company considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rents and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and distributions payable to approximate the fair value of these financial instruments based on the short duration between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair value of amounts due to affiliates is not determinable due to the related party nature of such amounts. The Company has determined that its notes payable are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
  The fair value of the notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using borrowing rates available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the notes payable was   $949,901,475   and   $827,207,564  , respectively, compared to the carrying value of   $951,474,817   and   $850,766,025  , respectively.  
  Distribution Policy 
  The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company intends to make distributions each taxable year equal to at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income (which is determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). Distributions declared during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were based on daily record dates and calculated at a rate of   $0.002459   per share per day during the period from January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016.  
  Distributions to stockholders are determined by the board of directors of the Company and are dependent upon a number of factors relating to the Company, including funds available for the payment of distributions, financial condition, the timing of property acquisitions, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements in order for the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company declared distributions totaling   $0.226   and   $0.674   per share of common stock, respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company declared distributions totaling   $0.227   and   $0.673   per share of common stock, respectively. 
  Per Share Data 
  Basic loss per share attributable to common stockholders for all periods presented are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Distributions declared per common share assume each share was issued and outstanding each day during the period. Nonvested shares of the Company s restricted common stock and convertible stock give rise to potentially dilutive

shares of the Company s common stock but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during the period. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations of prior periods. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company adopted new accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs following ASU 2015-03, as amended by ASU 2015-15, as further described below. As a result, the Company reclassified net debt issuance costs of   $4,091,494   and   $1,375,244   from other assets as of December 31, 2015 to mortgage notes payable, net and revolving credit facility, net, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  Segment Disclosure 
  The Company has determined that it has   one   reportable segment with activities related to investing in multifamily properties. The Company s investments in real estate are in different geographic regions, and management evaluates operating performance on an individual asset level. However, as each of the Company s assets has similar economic characteristics, tenants and products and services, its assets have been aggregated into   one   reportable segment. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (  Topic 606  ). The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new guidance supersedes the revenue requirements in Revenue Recognition (  Topic 605  ) and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The new guidance does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of Leases (  Topic 840  ). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which delayed 
  the effective date of the new guidance by one year, which will result in the new guidance being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted, but can be no earlier than the original public entity effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  Until now, the requirement to perform a going concern evaluation existed only in auditing standards. The new guidance requires management to evaluate relevant conditions, events and certain management plans that are known or reasonably knowable as of the evaluation date when determining whether substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists. Management will be required to make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods. The standard states substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact from adopting this new guidance. 
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,   Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items  , that eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. The objective of the new guidance is to simplify the income statement presentation requirements of GAAP. Eliminating the extraordinary classification simplifies income statement presentation by altogether removing the concept of extraordinary items from consideration. The guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company did not experience a material impact from adopting this new guidance.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation  , that provides amendments to the consolidation analysis. The amendments in this new guidance affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. The guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company did not experience a material impact from adopting this new guidance. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , as amended in August 2015 by ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   that requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of a debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The FASB will permit debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements to be deferred and presented as an asset and subsequently amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs will not be affected by the new guidance. The guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified net debt issuance costs related to both mortgage notes payable and line-of-credit arrangements of   $4,361,001   and   $1,434,540  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   $4,091,494   and   $1,375,244  , respectively, as of December 31, 2015, from other assets to mortgage notes payable, net and revolving credit facility, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , amending the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early adoption. The Company is assessing whether the new standard will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  , that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified on the statement of cash flows. This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact from adopting this new guidance.

  Depreciation of the Company s buildings and improvements was   $14,334,454   and   $39,002,300   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $6,786,834   and   $13,534,142   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  Amortization of the Company s tenant origination and absorption costs was   $2,299,268   and   $10,913,593   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $5,706,193   and   $12,028,670   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Tenant origination and absorption costs had a weighted-average amortization period as of the date of acquisition of less than   one year  . 
  Operating Leases  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s real estate portfolio comprised   11,601   apartment homes and was   96.2%   leased by a diverse group of residents. The residential lease terms consist of lease durations equal to   twelve months   or less. 
  Some residential leases contain provisions to extend the lease agreements, options for early termination after paying a specified penalty and other terms and conditions as negotiated. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires security deposits from tenants in the form of a cash deposit. Amounts required as security deposits vary depending upon the terms of the respective leases and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally are not significant amounts. Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in accounts payables and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $3,276,304   and   $2,332,451   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   tenant represented over   10%   of the Company s annualized base rent.

  Revolving Line of Credit 
  On   May 18, 2016  , the Company entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility (the  Line of Credit ) with PNC Bank in an amount not to exceed   $65,000,000  . The Line of Credit provides for advances (each, an  LOC Loan  and collectively, the  LOC Loans ) solely for the purpose of financing the costs in connection with acquisitions and development of real estate projects and for general corporate purposes (subject to certain debt service and loan to value requirements).

    The purchase price per share for shares repurchased upon the death or disability of a stockholder will be equal to the average issue price per share for all of the stockholder s shares. 
              (4) 
    For purposes of the share repurchase plan, the  Estimated Value per Share  will equal the most recently publicly disclosed estimated value per share of the Company as determined by the Company s board of directors. 
     The purchase price per share for shares repurchased pursuant to the Company s share repurchase plan will be further reduced by the aggregate amount of net proceeds per share, if any, distributed to the Company s stockholders prior to the repurchase date as a result of the sale of   one   or more of the Company s assets that constitutes a return of capital as a result of such sales. 
  Repurchases of shares of the Company s common stock will be made quarterly upon written request to the Company at least   15   days prior to the end of the applicable quarter. Repurchase requests will be honored approximately   30   days following the end of the applicable quarter (the  Repurchase Date ). Stockholders may withdraw their repurchase request at any time up to   three   business days prior to the Repurchase Date. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased a total of   64,483   and   107,916   shares with a total repurchase value of   $892,515   and   $1,480,781   and received requests for the repurchase of   48,658   and   134,555   shares with a total repurchase value of   $675,918   and   $1,862,902  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased a total of   6,601   and   13,501   shares with a total repurchase value of   $98,862   and   $202,317   and received requests for the repurchase of   5,267   and   16,503   shares with a total repurchase value of   $76,750   and   $245,164  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   48,658   and   5,267   shares of outstanding and unfulfilled repurchase requests, and recorded   $675,918   and   $76,750   in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to these unfulfilled repurchase requests, respectively. The Company repurchased the outstanding repurchase requests as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $675,918   and   $76,750   on the October 31, 2016 and October 30, 2015 Repurchase Dates, respectively. 
  The Company cannot guarantee that the funds set aside for the share repurchase plan will be sufficient to accommodate all repurchase requests made in any quarter. In the event that the Company does not have sufficient funds available to repurchase all of the shares of the Company s common stock for which repurchase requests have been submitted in any quarter, priority will be given to redemption requests in the case of the death or disability of a stockholder. If the Company repurchases less than all of the shares subject to a repurchase request in any quarter, with respect to any shares which have not been repurchased, the Company will treat the shares that have not been repurchased as a request for repurchase in the following quarter pursuant to the limitations of the share repurchase plan and when sufficient funds are available, unless the stockholder withdraws the request for repurchase. Such pending requests will be honored among all requests for repurchases in any given repurchase period as follows: first, pro rata as to repurchases sought upon a stockholder s death or disability; and, next, pro rata as to other repurchase requests. 
  The Company is not obligated to repurchase shares of its common stock under the share repurchase plan. The share repurchase plan limits the number of shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to (1)   5%   of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year and (2) those that could be funded from the net proceeds from the sale of shares under the DRP in the prior calendar year, plus such additional funds as may be reserved for that purpose by the Company s board of directors. Such sources of funds could include cash on hand, cash available from borrowings and cash from liquidations of securities investments as of the end of the applicable month, to the extent that such funds are not otherwise dedicated to a particular use, such as working capital, cash distributions to stockholders or purchases of real estate assets. There is   no   fee in connection with a repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Company s share repurchase plan. 
  The Company s board of directors may, in its sole discretion, amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase plan at any time upon   30   days  notice to its stockholders if it determines that the funds available to fund the share repurchase plan are needed for other business or operational purposes or that amendment, suspension or termination of the share repurchase plan is in the best interest of the Company s stockholders. Therefore, a stockholder may not have the opportunity to make a repurchase

request prior to any potential termination of the Company s share repurchase plan. The share repurchase plan will terminate in the event that a secondary market develops for the Company s shares of common stock. 
  Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $4,996,560   and   $14,134,773  , net of   $892,515   and   $1,480,781   of fulfilled repurchase requests, and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   $2,645,676   and   $5,640,163  , net of   $98,862   and   $202,317   of fulfilled repurchase requests, respectively, from permanent equity to temporary equity, which is included as redeemable common stock on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  Distributions 
  The Company s long-term policy is to pay distributions solely from cash flow from operations. However, because the Company may receive income from interest or rents at various times during the Company s fiscal year and because the Company may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, the Company expects that at least during the early stages of the Company s development and from time to time during the Company s operational stage, the Company will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that the Company expects to receive during a later period, and the Company expects to pay these distributions in advance of its actual receipt of these funds. The Company s board of directors has the authority under its organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to fund distributions from sources such as borrowings, offering proceeds or advances and the deferral of fees and expense reimbursements by the Advisor, in its sole discretion. The Company has not established a limit on the amount of proceeds it may use to fund distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations. If the Company pays distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the Company will have fewer funds available for investments and stockholders  overall return on their investment in the Company may be reduced. 
  To maintain the Company s qualification as a REIT, the Company must make aggregate annual distributions to its stockholders of at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). If the Company meets the REIT qualification requirements, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the income that the Company distributes to its stockholders each year. 
  Distributions Declared 
  The Company s board of directors approved a cash distribution that accrues at a rate of   $0.002466   per day for each share of the Company s common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which, if paid over a 365-day period is equivalent to a   6.0%   annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of   $15.00   per share of the Company s common stock. During the period from January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016, cash distributions accrue at a rate of   $0.002459   per day for each share, which, if paid over a 366-day period, is equivalent to a   6.0%   annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of   $15.00   per share of the Company s common stock. The distributions declared accrue daily to stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day and are payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month. There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to pay distributions at this rate or at all.  
  Distributions declared for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $11,135,168   and   $31,140,959  , including   $5,899,834   and   $16,578,221  , or   408,011   and   1,155,416   shares of common stock, attributable to the DRP.  
  Distributions declared for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were   $5,586,074   and   $12,540,127  , including   $2,971,637   and   $6,597,098  , or   208,536   and   462,954   shares of common stock, attributable to the DRP. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $3,640,148   and   $2,563,769   of distributions declared were payable, which included   $1,928,379   and   $1,380,280  , or   133,360   shares and   96,862   shares of common stock, attributable to the DRP.

When recognized, organizational costs are expensed as incurred. From inception through   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor incurred   $42,882   of organizational costs on the Company s behalf, all of which was reimbursed to the Advisor.  
  Investment Management Fee 
  The Company pays the Advisor a monthly investment management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.0% of the cost of the Company s investments in real properties and real estate-related assets or the Company s proportionate share thereof in the case of investments made through joint ventures. Such fee is calculated including acquisition fees, acquisition expenses and any debt attributable to such investments.  
  Acquisition Fees and Expenses 
  The Company pays the Advisor an acquisition fee equal to   1.0%   of the cost of investment, which includes the amount actually paid or budgeted to fund the acquisition, origination, development, construction or improvement (i.e. value-enhancement) of any real property or real estate-related asset acquired. In addition to acquisition fees, the Company reimburses the Advisor for amounts directly incurred by the Advisor and amounts the Advisor pays to third parties in connection with the selection, evaluation, acquisition and development of a property or acquisition of real estate-related assets, whether or not the Company ultimately acquires the property or the real estate-related assets. 
  The Charter limits the Company s ability to pay acquisition fees if the total of all acquisition fees and expenses relating to the purchase would exceed   4.5%   of the contract purchase price. Under the Charter, a majority of the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, is required to approve any acquisition fees (or portion thereof) that would cause the total of all acquisition fees and expenses relating to an acquisition to exceed   4.5%   of the contract purchase price. In connection with the purchase of securities, the acquisition fee may be paid to an affiliate of the Advisor that is registered as a FINRA member broker-dealer if applicable FINRA rules would prohibit the payment of the acquisition fee to a firm that is not a registered broker-dealer.  
  Loan Coordination Fee 
  The Company pays the Advisor or its affiliate a loan coordination fee equal to   1.0%   of the initial amount of the new debt financed or outstanding debt assumed in connection with the acquisition, development, construction, improvement or origination of a property or a real estate-related asset. In addition, in connection with any financing or the refinancing of any debt (in each case, other than identified at the time of the acquisition of a property or a real estate-related asset), the Company will pay the Advisor or its affiliate a loan coordination fee equal to   0.75%   of the amount of debt financed or refinanced. 
  Property Management Fees and Expenses 
  The Company has entered into Property Management Agreements with Steadfast Management Company, Inc., an affiliate of the Sponsor (the  Property Manager ), in connection with the management of each of the Company s properties. The property management fee payable with respect to each property under the Property Management Agreements (each, a  Property Management Agreement ) at   September 30, 2016   ranges from   2.5%   to   3.0%   of the annual gross revenue collected at the property, as determined by the Advisor and approved by a majority of the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors. Each Property Management Agreement has an initial   one  -year term and will continue thereafter on a month-to-month basis unless either party gives a   60  -day prior notice of its desire to terminate the Property Management Agreement, provided that the Company may terminate the Property Management Agreement at any time upon a determination of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad acts of the Property Manager or its employees or upon an uncured breach of the Property Management Agreement upon   30   days  prior written notice to the Property Manager. 
  In addition to the property management fee, the Property Management Agreements also specify certain other fees payable to the Property Manager for benefit administration, information technology infrastructure, licenses, and support and training services.

Construction Management Fees and Expenses  
  The Company has entered into Construction Management Agreements with Pacific Coast Land   Construction, Inc., an affiliate of the Sponsor (the  Construction Manager ), in connection with capital improvements and renovation or value-enhancement projects for certain properties the Company acquires. The construction management fee payable with respect to each property under the Construction Management Agreements (each a  Construction Management Agreement ) has ranged from   8.0%   to   12.0%   of the costs of the improvements for which the Construction Manager has planning and oversight authority. Generally, each Construction Management Agreement can be terminated by either party with   30 days    prior written notice to the other party. Construction management fees are capitalized to the respective real estate properties in the period in which they are incurred as such costs relate to capital improvements and renovations for apartment homes taken out of service while they undergo the planned renovation. 
  The Company may also reimburse the Construction Manager for the salaries and related benefits of its employees for time spent working on capital improvements and renovations. 
  Insurance Deductible Reserve 
  The Company deposits with an affiliate of the Sponsor moneys to fund an insurance deductible reserve account to cover the cost of required insurance deductibles across all multifamily properties of the Company and other affiliated entities. Upon filing a major claim, proceeds from the insurance deductible reserve account may be used by the Company or another affiliate of the Sponsor. 
  Other Operating Expense Reimbursement 
  In addition to the various fees paid to the Advisor, the Company is obligated to pay directly or reimburse all expenses incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company, including the Company s allocable share of the Advisor s overhead, such as rent, employee costs, utilities and information technology costs. The Company will not reimburse the Advisor for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor or its affiliates receive acquisition fees or disposition fees or for the salaries the Advisor pays to the Company s executive officers. 
  The Charter limits the Company s total operating expenses during any   four   fiscal quarters to the greater of   2%   of the Company s average invested assets or   25%   of the Company s net income for the same period (the    2%  /  25%   Limitation ). The Company may reimburse the Advisor, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for operating expenses incurred by the Advisor; provided, however, that the Company shall not reimburse the Advisor at the end of any fiscal quarter for operating expenses that exceed the   2%  /  25%   Limitation unless the independent directors have determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. The Advisor must reimburse the Company for the amount by which the Company s operating expenses for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended exceed the   2%  /  25%   Limitation, unless such excess is approved by the independent directors. For purposes of determining the   2%  /  25%   Limitation amount,  average invested assets  means the average monthly book value of the Company s assets invested directly or indirectly in equity interests and loans secured by real estate during the   12  -month period before deducting depreciation, bad debts reserves or other non-cash reserves.  Total operating expenses  means all expenses paid or incurred by the Company that are in any way related to the Company s operation, including the Company s allocable share of Advisor overhead and investment management fees, but excluding (a) the expenses of raising capital such as organization and offering expenses, legal, audit, accounting, underwriting, brokerage, listing, registration and other fees, printing and other such expenses and taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, distribution, transfer, listing and registration of shares of the Company s common stock; (b) interest payments; (c) taxes; (d) non-cash expenditures such as depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves; (e) reasonable incentive fees based on the gain in the sale of the Company s assets; (f) acquisition fees and acquisition expenses (including expenses relating to potential acquisitions that the Company does not close); (g) real estate commissions on the resale of investments; and (h) other expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition, management and ownership of investments (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair and improvement of real property). 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s total operating expenses, as defined above, did not exceed the   2%  /  25%   Limitation.

Disposition Fee 
  If the Advisor or its affiliates provide a substantial amount of services in connection with the sale of a property or real estate-related asset as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors, the Company will pay the Advisor or its affiliates one-half of the brokerage commissions paid, but in no event to exceed   1.0%   of the sales price of each property or real estate-related asset sold. To the extent the disposition fee is paid upon the sale of any assets other than real property, it will be included as an operating expense for purposes of the   2%  /  25%   Limitation. In connection with the sale of securities, the disposition fee may be paid to an affiliate of the Advisor that is registered as a FINRA member broker-dealer if applicable FINRA rules would prohibit the payment of the disposition fee to a firm that is not a registered broker-dealer. As of   September 30, 2016   the Company had not sold or otherwise disposed of any properties or real estate-related assets. Accordingly, the Company had   not   incurred any disposition fees as of   September 30, 2016  .

  The Company paid the Dealer Manager up to   7%   and   3%   of the gross offering proceeds from the Primary Offering as selling commissions and dealer manager fees, respectively. The Company allowed a participating broker-dealer to elect to receive the   7%   selling commission at the time of sale or elect to have the selling commission paid on a trailing basis. A participating broker-dealer that elected to receive a trailing selling commission is paid as follows:   2%   at the time of sale and the remaining   5%   paid ratably (  1%   per year) on each of the first   five   anniversaries of the sale. A reduced sales commission and dealer manager fee was paid in connection with volume discounts and certain other categories of sales.   No   sales commission or dealer manager fee was paid with respect to shares of common stock issued pursuant to the DRP. The Dealer Manager reallowed   100%   of sales commissions earned to participating broker-dealers. The Dealer Manager could reallow to any participating broker-dealer a portion of the dealer manager fee that is attributable to that participating broker-dealer for certain marketing costs of that participating broker-dealer. The Dealer Manager negotiated the reallowance of the dealer manager fee on a case-by-case basis with each participating broker-dealer subject to various factors associated with the cost of the marketing program. The Company terminated the Public Offering on March 24, 2016, and as of   September 30, 2016  , expects to pay trailing selling commissions subsequent to that date of   $855,361  , which were charged to additional paid-in capital and are included within amounts due to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  8.                Incentive Award Plan and Independent Director Compensation 
  The Company has adopted an incentive plan (the  Incentive Award Plan ) that provides for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants and those of the Company s affiliates. The Incentive Award Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and other stock-based awards or cash-based awards. 
  Under the Company s independent directors  compensation plan, which is a sub-plan of the Incentive Award Plan, each of the Company s independent directors receives   3,333   shares of restricted common stock once the Company raised   $2,000,000   in gross offering proceeds in the Public Offering. Each subsequent independent director that joins the Company s board of directors receives   3,333   shares of restricted common stock upon election to the Company s board of directors. In addition, on the date following an independent director s re-election to the Company s board of directors, he or she receives   1,666   shares of restricted common stock. One-fourth of the shares of restricted common stock generally vest and become non-forfeitable upon issuance and the remaining portion will vest in   three   equal annual installments beginning on the date of grant and ending on the third anniversary of the date of grant; provided, however, that the restricted stock will become fully vested and become non-forfeitable on the earlier to occur of (1) the termination of the independent director s service as a director due to his or her death or disability or (2) a change in control of the Company. These awards entitle the holders to participate in distributions. 
  On   August 13, 2015   and   August 11, 2016  , the Company granted   1,666   shares of restricted common stock to each of its   three   independent directors upon their re-election to the Company s board of directors at each of the   2015   and   2016   annual meetings of stockholders. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of   $39,306   and   $76,797   for the   three and nine

months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $35,348   and   $63,482   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to the independent directors restricted common stock. 
  In addition to the stock awards, the Company pays each of its independent directors an annual retainer of   $55,000  , prorated for any partial term (the audit committee chairperson receives an additional   $10,000   annual retainer, prorated for any partial term). In addition, the independent directors are paid for attending meetings as follows: (i)   $2,500   for each board meeting attended in person, (ii)   $1,500   for each committee meeting attended in person in such director s capacity as a committee member, (iii)   $1,000   for each board meeting attended via teleconference (not to exceed   $4,000   for any one set of meetings attended on any given day). All directors also receive reimbursement of reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of the board of directors. Director compensation is an operating expense of the Company that is subject to the operating expense reimbursement obligation of the Advisor discussed in Note 7. The Company recorded an operating expense of   $60,750   and   $180,250   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $55,750   and   $180,250   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   related to the independent directors  annual retainer and board meeting attendance, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $60,750   and   $61,750   related to the independent directors  annual retainer and board meetings attendance is included in due to affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  9.                Commitments and Contingencies 
  Economic Dependency    
  The Company is dependent on the Advisor for certain services that are essential to the Company, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, purchase and disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments; management of the daily operations of the Company s real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that the Advisor is unable to provide such services, the Company will be required to obtain such services from other sources. The Company may not be able to retain services from such other sources on favorable terms or at all. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  The geographic concentration of the Company s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the Atlanta, Georgia, Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas and Nashville, Tennessee apartment markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, increased competition from other apartment communities, decrease in demand for apartments or any other changes, could adversely affect the Company s operating results and its ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
  Environmental    
  As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to the properties could result in future environmental liabilities. 
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is subject, or party, to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition nor is the Company aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies.

10.                Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses interest rate derivatives with the objective of managing exposure to interest rate movements thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes and the effect they could have on future cash flows. Interest rate cap agreements are used to accomplish this objective. The following table provides the terms of the Company s interest rate derivative instruments that were in effect at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

The interest rate cap agreements are not designated as effective cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the Company records any changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements as interest expense. The change in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted in an unrealized loss of   $73,518   and   $691,969   and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulted in an unrealized loss of   $1,038,080   and   $2,206,162  , respectively, which is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company acquired interest rate cap agreements of   $116,100   and   $2,248,826  , respectively. The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements of   $73,330   and   $649,199   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , is included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  11.                Pro Forma Information  
  The following table summarizes, on an unaudited basis, the consolidated pro forma results of operations of the Company for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company acquired   two   properties during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   four   properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . These properties contributed   $6,195,426   of revenues and   $3,337,541   of net loss, including   $5,626,692   of depreciation and amortization, to the Company s results of operations from the date of acquisition to   September 30, 2016  . The following unaudited pro forma information for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   has been provided to give effect to the acquisitions of the properties as if they had occurred on   January 1, 2015  . This pro forma information does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations of the Company would have been had these acquisitions occurred on this date, nor does it purport to predict the results of operations for future periods. 

The pro forma information reflects adjustments for actual revenues and expenses of the properties acquired during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   for the respective period prior to acquisition by the Company. Net loss has been adjusted as follows: (1) interest expense has been adjusted to reflect the additional interest expense that would have been

charged had the Company acquired the properties on   January 1, 2015   under the same financing arrangements as existed as of the acquisition date; (2) depreciation and amortization has been adjusted based on the Company s basis in the properties; and (3) transaction costs have been adjusted for the acquisition of the properties.

The distributions for each record date in January 2017, February 2017 and March 2017 will be paid in February 2017, March 2017 and April 2017, respectively. The distributions will be payable to stockholders from legally available funds therefor.

As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Steadfast Apartment REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our Operating Partnership and to their subsidiaries. 
   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Quarterly Report ) that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning investment objectives, other plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto) are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as  may,   should,   expect,   could,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   predict,   potential  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
  The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: 
             
    the fact that we have a limited operating history and commenced operations on May 22, 2014; 
                
    the fact that we have had a net loss for each quarterly and annual period since inception;  
                
    changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate and debt markets specifically;  
                
    our ability to successfully identify and acquire multifamily properties on terms that are favorable to us;  
                
    our ability to secure resident leases for our multifamily properties at favorable rental rates;  
                
    risks inherent in the real estate business, including resident defaults, potential liability relating to environmental matters and the lack of liquidity of real estate investments;  
                
    the fact that we pay fees and expenses to our Advisor and its affiliates that were not negotiated on an arm s length basis and the fact that the payment of these fees and expenses increases the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us;  
                
    our ability to retain our executive officers and other key personnel of our Advisor, our property manager and other affiliates of our Advisor;  
                
    our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to pay distributions for our stockholders; 
                
    legislative or regulatory changes (including changes to the laws governing the taxation of REITs);  
                
    the availability of capital;  
                
    changes in interest rates; and  
                
    changes to GAAP. 
     Any of the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements could be inaccurate. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report and the risk that actual results will differ materially from the expectations expressed in this Quarterly Report will increase with the passage of time. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. In light of the significant

uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report, the inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the objectives and plans set forth in this Quarterly Report will be achieved. 
  All forward looking statements included herein should be read in light of the factors identified in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. 
   
  Overview 
  We were formed on August 22, 2013, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to qualify as a REIT. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from our ongoing Public Offering, which terminated on March 24, 2016 (as further described below), to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of multifamily properties located in targeted markets throughout the United States. In addition to our focus on multifamily properties, we may also make selective strategic acquisitions of other types of commercial properties. We may also acquire or originate mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate loans and equity securities of other real estate companies. 
  On December 30, 2013, we commenced our Public Offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC, to offer a maximum of 66,666,667 shares of common stock for sale to the public at an initial price of $15.00 per share (subject to certain discounts). We also offered up to 7,017,544 shares of common stock pursuant to our DRP at an initial price of $14.25 per share.  
  On March 24, 2016, we terminated our Public Offering. As of   March 24, 2016  , we had sold   48,625,651   shares of common stock for gross proceeds of   $724,849,631  , including   1,011,561   shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRP for gross offering proceeds of   $14,414,752  . We continue to offer shares pursuant to our DRP. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold   49,430,739   shares of common stock for gross proceeds of   $736,437,314  , including   1,816,711   shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRP for gross offering proceeds of   $26,002,435  . 
  On March 24, 2016, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $14.46 as of December 31, 2015. In connection with the determination of our estimated value per share, our board of directors increased the purchase price of shares offered pursuant to our DRP to $14.46, effective May 1, 2016. Our board of directors may again, in its sole discretion and from time to time, change the price at which we offer shares pursuant to our DRP to reflect changes in our estimated value per share and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. 
  Steadfast Apartment Advisor, LLC is our advisor. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. Our Advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our Advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf. 
  Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the only limited partner of our Operating Partnership. As we accepted subscriptions for shares of common stock, we transferred substantially all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering to our Operating Partnership as a capital contribution. The limited partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership provides that our Operating Partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our Operating Partnership will not be classified as a  publicly traded partnership  for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in our Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a disregarded entity. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our Operating Partnership in acquiring and operating our investments, our Operating Partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our Operating Partnership.  
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations.

Market Outlook 
  During times of economic downturn, market conditions could negatively impact the multifamily real estate sector, resulting in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values. The economy in the United States has improved; however, there is no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future. We believe we currently have unique investment opportunities, particularly in the multifamily sector. Home ownership rates are the lowest they have been since 1967. Demographic and economic factors favor the flexibility of rental housing and discourage the potential financial burden associated with home ownership. Additionally, Millennials and Baby Boomers, the two largest demographic groups comprising roughly half of the total population in the United States, are increasingly choosing to live in a variety of rental housing. Our plan is to provide rental housing for these multi-generational groups as they age. Millennials are getting married and having children later and are choosing to live in apartment communities until their mid-30s. Today, 30% of Millennials are still living with their parents or are still in school. When they get a job, Millennials will likely rent moderate income apartments based upon an average income of $35,000. We believe this creates a demand for multifamily housing.  
  Our Real Estate Portfolio 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned the   34   multifamily properties listed below:

           (1) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was approximately   96.2%   leased, calculated using the number of occupied and contractually leased units divided by total units. 
              (2) 
    Average monthly rent is based upon the effective rental income after considering the effect of vacancies, concessions and write-offs.  
              (3) 
    Mortgage debt outstanding is net of deferred financing costs and loan discount associated with the loans for each individual property listed above but excludes the principal balance of   $15,000,000   and associated deferred financing costs of   $921,501   related to the revolving credit facilities at the company level. 
      
  Critical Accounting Policies    
  The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies during the period covered by this report other than described in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report in the discussion of our significant accounting policies. 
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  Organization and offering expenses included all expenses (other than sales commissions and the dealer manager fee) paid by us in connection with our Public Offering, including legal, accounting, tax, printing, mailing and filing fees, charges of our escrow agent and transfer agent, expenses of organizing our company, data processing fees, advertising and sales literature costs, transfer agent costs, out-of-pocket due diligence costs and amounts to reimburse our Advisor or its affiliates for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and providing other administrative services in connection with our Public Offering. Any such reimbursement did not exceed actual expenses incurred by our Advisor. Following the termination of our Public Offering, our Advisor had an obligation to reimburse us to the extent total organization and offering expenses borne by us (including selling commissions and dealer manager fees) exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised in our Public Offering. No amounts were owed to us by our Advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement because total organization and offering expenses did not exceed 15% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our Public Offering. 
  To the extent we did not pay the full sales commissions or dealer manager fee for shares sold in our Public Offering, we could also reimburse costs of training and education meetings held by us (primarily the travel, meal and lodging costs of registered representatives of broker-dealers), attendance and sponsorship fees and cost reimbursement of employees of our affiliates to attend seminars conducted by broker-dealers and, in certain cases, reimbursement to participating broker-dealers for technology costs associated with our Public Offering, costs and expenses related to such technology costs, and costs and expenses associated with the facilitation of the marketing of our shares and the ownership of our shares by such broker-dealers  customers. Through the termination of our Public Offering, underwriting compensation paid by us did not exceed 10% of the gross offering proceeds raised in our Public Offering. 
  When recognized, organization costs are expensed as incurred. Offering costs, including selling commissions and dealer manager fees, are deferred and charged to stockholders  equity as such amounts are reimbursed to the Advisor, the Dealer Manager or their affiliates from gross offering proceeds. 
  Income Taxes 
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. 
  We follow the income tax guidance under GAAP to recognize, measure, present and disclose in our consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We have not been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions. Our evaluation was performed for the tax years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  .  
  Distributions 
  Our board of directors has declared daily distributions that are paid on a monthly basis. We expect to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions or other factors prohibit us from doing so. We may declare distributions in excess of our funds from operations. As a result, our

  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90% of our  REIT taxable income  each year. 
  Distributions declared (1) accrue daily to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day, (2) are payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month and (3) were calculated at a rate of   $0.002466   per share per day during the year ended December 31, 2015, which if paid each day over a 365-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock. During the period from January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, distributions declared were calculated at a rate of   $0.002459   per share per day, which if paid over a 366-day period is equivalent to a 6.0% annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of $15.00 per share of common stock.  
  The distributions paid during each of the last five fiscal quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRP were as follows:

            (2) 
    Assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the period presented. 
              (3) 
    Distributions are paid on a monthly basis. Distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid approximately three days following month end. 
     For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate distributions of   $11,109,487   and   $30,064,580  , including   $5,220,413   and   $14,034,458   of distributions paid in cash and   407,266   and   1,116,900   shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our DRP for   $5,889,074   and   $16,030,122  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our net loss was   $9,888,814   and   $30,103,111  , we had funds from operations ( FFO ) of   $6,744,908   and   $19,812,782   and net cash provided by operations of   $9,504,533   and   $26,774,509  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we funded   $9,504,533  , or   86%  , and   $26,264,515  , or   87%  , of distributions paid respectively, from net cash provided by operating activities and   $1,604,954  , or   14%  , and   $3,800,065  , or   13%  , respectively, from net Public Offering proceeds, which includes net cash distributions and distributions reinvested by stockholders. For information on how we calculate FFO and the reconciliation of FFO to net loss, see   Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.  
  Our long-term policy is to pay distributions solely from cash flow from operations. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year and because we may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that at least during the early stages of our development and from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period, and we expect to pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, our board of directors has the authority under our organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to fund distributions from sources such as borrowings, offering proceeds or advances and the deferral of fees and expense reimbursements by our Advisor, in its sole discretion. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use from sources other than cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have fewer funds available for investments.

Inflation 
  Substantially all of our multifamily property leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally will minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore will expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had not entered into any leases as a lessee. 
  REIT Compliance 
  To qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We use secured borrowings, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured borrowings. Upon investing all of the net offering proceeds from our Public Offering, our borrowings were approximately 61% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 55% to 60% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent third party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our Charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets, though we may exceed this limit only under certain circumstances. 
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our Advisor and Dealer Manager. During our organization and offering stage, we made payments to the Dealer Manager for sales commissions and the dealer manager fees and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. Currently, during our operating stage, we make payments to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. 
  Our principal demand for funds will be to acquire investments in accordance with our investment strategy, to fund value-enhancement and other capital improvement projects, to pay operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. Over time, we intend to generally fund our cash needs, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Otherwise, we expect that our principal sources of working capital will include: 
              
    various forms of secured and unsecured financing; 
                
    borrowings under master repurchase agreements; 
                
    cash flow from operations; 
                
    equity capital from joint venture partners; and 
                
    proceeds from our DRP. 
     Over the short term, we believe that our sources of capital, specifically our cash balances, cash flow from operations, our ability to raise equity capital from joint venture partners and our ability to obtain various forms of secured and unsecured financing including financing pursuant to our Credit Facility and Line of Credit described below, will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments. 
  Over the longer term, in addition to the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, we may also conduct additional public or private offerings of our securities. We expect these resources will be adequate to fund our operating activities, debt service and distributions, and will be sufficient to fund our ongoing acquisition

activities as well as providing capital for investment in future development and other joint ventures along with potential forward purchase commitments. 
  On   August 26, 2015  , we entered into the Credit Facility with PNC Bank in an amount not to exceed   $200,000,000  , which provides for advances to purchase properties or refinance existing properties from time to time (subject to certain debt service and loan to value requirements). The Credit Facility has a Maturity Date of   September 1, 2020  , subject to extension. The maximum amount that may be drawn under the Credit Facility may be increased up to   $350,000,000   at any time during the period from January 1, 2016 to 12 months prior to the Maturity Date. Advances made under the Credit Facility will be secured by the property for which such advances are used. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $185,150,604   was outstanding on the Credit Facility, net. Interest on the outstanding principal balances of advances accrue at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus (1) the servicing spread of   0.05%   and (2) the net spread, based on the debt service coverage ratio, of between   1.80%   and   2.10%  , as further described in the applicable Notes. Monthly interest payments are due and payable on the first day of each month until the Maturity Date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on all advances are due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. For additional information on our Credit Facility, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report. 
    
  On   May 18, 2016  , we entered into the Line of Credit with PNC Bank in an amount not to exceed   $65,000,000  . The Line of Credit provides for advances solely for the purpose of financing the costs in connection with acquisitions and development of real estate projects and for general corporate purposes (subject to certain debt service and loan to value requirements). The Line of Credit has a LOC Maturity Date of   May 17, 2019  , subject to extension, as further described in the LOC Loan Agreement entered into by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with PNC Bank in connection with the acquisition of the Mortgaged Property, the Landings of Brentwood. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $14,714,856   was outstanding on our Line of Credit, net. We have the option to select the interest rate in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the LOC Loans from the following options as follows: (1) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the LOC Loan Agreement) plus   0.60%   or (2) a rate per annum fixed for the applicable LIBOR Interest Period (as defined in the LOC Loan Agreement) equal to the sum of LIBOR plus   1.60%  . Monthly interest payments are due and payable in arrears on the first day of each month and on the LOC Maturity Date. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on the LOC Loans are due and payable in full on the LOC Maturity Date. For additional information on our Line of Credit, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report. We continue to evaluate possible other sources of capital, including, without limitation, entering into additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms, if at all.  
  Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
  We commenced real estate operations with the acquisition of our first multifamily property on May 22, 2014. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   34   multifamily properties. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   net cash provided by operating activities   was   $26,774,509   compared to net cash used in operating activities of   $5,624,808   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization and restricted cash partially offset by a decrease in net loss, due to affiliates and accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with   34   multifamily properties owned as of   September 30, 2016   compared to the   24   multifamily properties owned as of   September 30, 2015  . We expect to continue to generate cash flows from operations as we stabilize the operations of our property portfolio and complete our value-enhancement program. 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   net cash used in investing activities   was   $251,421,297   compared to   $649,029,710   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in   net cash used in investing activities   was primarily the result of our acquisition of   four   multifamily properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   17   acquisitions of multifamily properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of the following: 
                
    $605,276   of cash provided by restricted cash accounts related to replacement reserves;

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   net cash provided by financing activities   was   $211,803,138   compared to   $676,010,974   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in   net cash provided by financing activities   is due primarily to the decrease in proceeds from issuance of mortgage notes payable, borrowings from credit facilities and issuance of common stock from   $331,070,500  ,   $114,600,000   and   $269,681,317  , respectively, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $41,850,000  ,   $15,000,000   and   $193,953,604  , respectively, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of the following:  
       Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  We use secured debt, and intend to use in the future secured and unsecured debt. We believe that the careful use of borrowings will help us achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. Upon investing all of the net offering proceeds from our Public Offering, our borrowings were approximately 61% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 65% of the value of our properties (after debt amortization) and other real estate-related assets. For valuation purposes, the value of a property will equal the value determined by an independent third party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our Charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets unless such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders, along with a justification for such excess, in our next quarterly report. In such event, we will monitor our debt levels and take action to reduce any such excess as practicable. Our aggregate borrowings are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. As of   September 30, 2016  , our aggregate borrowings were not in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. 
  In addition to using our capital resources for investing purposes and meeting our debt obligations, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our Advisor. We expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with the management of our asset portfolio and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had indebtedness totaling an aggregate principal amount of   $951,474,817  , including the net discount on a note payable of   $2,721,540   and the net deferred financing costs of $  5,795,541  . The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  :

    Projected principal payments on outstanding debt obligations are based on the terms of the notes payable agreements. Amounts exclude the amortization of the debt discount and net deferred financing costs associated with certain notes payable. 
      
  Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  The discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The ability to compare one period to another is significantly affected by acquisitions completed and distributions made during those periods. We commenced real estate operations on May 22, 2014 in connection with the acquisition of our first investment, the Villages at Spring Hill Apartments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   34   multifamily properties compared to owning   24   multifamily properties as of   September 30, 2015  . The increase in our property portfolio is the primary cause of the increases in operating income and expenses, as further discussed below. 
  Our results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are not indicative of those expected in future periods. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we continue the process of value-enhancement projects, which may have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In general, we expect that our income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of organic rent increases and anticipated value-enhancement projects. 
  To provide additional insight into our operating results, we are also providing a detailed analysis of same-store versus non-same-store net operating income ( NOI ). For more information on NOI and a reconciliation of NOI (a non-GAAP measure) to net loss, see   Net Operating Income.  
  Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

(1)  
    NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of our properties and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs, all of which are significant economic costs. For additional information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see   Net Operating Income.  
              (2)  
    GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. Additionally, we use modified funds from operations ( MFFO ) as defined by the Investment Program Association (the  IPA ) as a supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance. MFFO is based on FFO but includes certain adjustments we believe are necessary due to changes in accounting and reporting under GAAP since the establishment of FFO. Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as alternatives to net loss or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of our operating performance, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of liquidity. For additional information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see   Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.  
     Net loss  
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had a net loss of   $9,888,814   compared to a net loss of   $14,219,859   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in net loss of   $4,331,045   over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the   decrease   in acquisition costs of   $1,068,611   due to the acquisition of   two   multifamily properties during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the acquisition of   six   multifamily properties in three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the   decrease   in fees to affiliates of   $339,201   and the   increase   in total revenues of   $17,165,253  , offset by the   increase   in operating, maintenance and management expenses of   $4,147,756  , the   increase   in real estate taxes and insurance of   $2,844,332  , the   increase   in depreciation and amortization expense of   $4,140,695  , the   increase   in interest expense of   $2,460,510   and the   increase   in general and administrative expenses of   $648,727  . The increase in these expenses was due primarily to the increase in our property portfolio from   24   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2015   to   34   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Total revenues 
  Total revenues were   $37,357,939   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $20,192,686   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $17,165,253   was primarily due to owning   34   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2016   compared to   24   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2015  . Our total units increased by   3,710   from   7,891   at   September 30, 2015   to   11,601   at   September 30, 2016  . Average monthly rents per unit increased from   $1,000   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $1,091   as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases, improved occupancy and the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy. 
  Operating, maintenance and management expenses 
  Operating, maintenance and management expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $9,754,819   compared to   $5,607,063   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $4,147,756   was primarily due to operating   34   multifamily properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   24   multifamily properties as of   September 30, 2015  . We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties. 
  Real estate taxes and insurance 
  Real estate taxes and insurance expenses were   $5,083,703   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2,239,371   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $2,844,332   was due to the acquisition of   10   multifamily properties since   September 30, 2015   and real estate taxes and insurance expenses for a full reporting period on properties acquired during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We expect these amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax rate increases as well as increases in the assessed value of our property portfolio.

Fees to affiliates 
  Fees to affiliates were   $7,412,526   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7,751,727   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $339,201   was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition fees and loan coordination fees as a result of the acquisition of   two   multifamily properties during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the acquisition of   six   multifamily properties in three months ended   September 30, 2015  , partially offset by an increase in investment management and property management fees as a result of the growth in our portfolio.  
  We expect fees to affiliates related to the on-going management of our real estate portfolio to increase in future periods as a result of a full period of operations for the   two   multifamily properties acquired during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . We expect fees to affiliates related to initial acquisition and financing activities to decrease in future periods as a result of the termination of the Public Offering and the decrease in anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses were   $16,633,722   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $12,493,027   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $4,140,695   was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of   $531,044,028   since   September 30, 2015  . We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio. 
  Interest expense 
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6,547,052   compared to   $4,086,542   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $2,460,510   was primarily due to the increase in the notes payable balance (before deducting deferred financing fees and loan discount) of   $289,860,339   since   September 30, 2015   due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of seven multifamily properties since   September 30, 2015  . Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of   $242,077   and   $117,487  , the unrealized loss on derivative instruments of   $73,518   and   $1,038,080   and credit facility commitment fees of   $56,597   and   $11,968   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives. 
  General and administrative expenses 
  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,259,368   compared to   $610,641   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The   increase   of   $648,727   was primarily due to the acquisition of   10   multifamily properties since   September 30, 2015   and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of   September 30, 2015  . We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues. 
  Acquisition costs 
  Acquisition costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $555,563   compared to   $1,624,174   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $1,068,611   was due primarily to the acquisition of   two   multifamily properties with an aggregate purchase price of   $121,822,500   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the acquisition of   six   multifamily properties with an aggregate purchase price of   $245,230,000   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We expect acquisition costs to decrease in future periods as we expect to acquire substantially fewer properties and real estate-related investments in future periods.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

     Net loss  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had a net loss of   $30,103,111   compared to   $33,183,194   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in net loss of   $3,080,083   over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the   increase   in total revenues of   $63,861,828   and the   decrease   in acquisition costs of   $2,989,258   offset by the   increase   in operating, maintenance and management expenses of   $14,725,548  , the   increase   in real estate taxes and insurance of   $10,212,197  , the   increase   in fees to affiliates of   $1,746,213  , the   increase   in depreciation and amortization expense of   $24,353,081  , the   increase   in interest expense of   $11,345,064   and the   increase   in general and administrative expenses of   $1,388,900  . The increase in these expenses was due primarily to the increase in our property portfolio from   24   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2015   to   34   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Total revenues  
  Total revenues were   $104,549,081   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $40,687,253   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .   The   increase   of   $63,861,828   was primarily due to owning   34   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2016   compared to   24   multifamily properties at   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, our total units increased by   3,710   from   7,891   at   September 30, 2015   to   11,601   at   September 30, 2016  . Average monthly rents per unit increased from   $1,000   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $1,091   as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases, improved occupancy and the implementation of our value-enhancement strategy.  
  Operating, maintenance and management expenses 
  Operating, maintenance and management expenses were   $25,807,704   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $11,082,156   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $14,725,548   was primarily due to operating   34   multifamily properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   24   multifamily properties as of   September 30, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties. 
  Real estate taxes and insurance 
  Real estate taxes and insurance expenses were   $15,483,039   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $5,270,842   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $10,212,197   was due to the acquisition of   10   multifamily properties since   September 30, 2015   and real estate taxes and insurance expenses for a full reporting period on properties acquired during the nine months   September 30, 2015  . We expect these amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax increases as well as increases in the assessed value of our property portfolio. 
  Fees to affiliates  
  Fees to affiliates were   $19,081,916   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $17,335,703   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $1,746,213   was primarily due to the increase in investment management and property management fees as a result of the growth of our portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition fees and loan coordination fees as a result of the acquisition of   four   multifamily properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the acquisition of   17   multifamily properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  We expect fees to affiliates related to the on-going management of our real estate portfolio to increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments and a full period of operations for the four multifamily properties acquired during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . We expect fees to affiliates related to initial acquisition and financing activities to decrease in future periods as a result of the termination of the Public Offering and the decrease in anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments. 
  Depreciation and amortization  
  Depreciation and amortization expenses were   $49,915,893   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $25,562,812   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $24,353,081   was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of   $531,044,028   since   September 30, 2015  . We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio. 
  Interest expense  
  Interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $19,283,573   compared to   $7,938,509   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $11,345,064   was primarily due to the increase in the notes payable balance (before deducting deferred financing fees and loan discount) of   $289,860,339   since   September 30, 2015   due to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of seven multifamily properties since   September 30, 2015  . Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of   $676,447   and   $220,287  , the unrealized loss on derivative instruments of   $691,969   and   $2,206,162   and credit facility commitment fees of   $71,514   and   $11,968   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives. 
  General and administrative expenses  
  General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $3,406,931   compared to   $2,018,031   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees and independent director compensation. The   increase   of   $1,388,900   was primarily due to the acquisition of   10   multifamily properties since   September 30, 2015   and the continuing operation of the properties owned as of   September 30, 2015  . We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues. 
  Acquisition costs  
  Acquisition costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $1,673,136   compared to   $4,662,394   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $2,989,258   was due primarily to the acquisition of   four   multifamily properties with an aggregate purchase price of   $264,222,500   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the acquisition of   17   multifamily properties with an aggregate purchase price of   $657,945,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We expect acquisition costs to decrease in future periods as we expect to acquire fewer properties and real estate-related investments in future periods.

Property Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  For purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance, we categorize our properties as  same-store  or  non-same-store.  A  same-store  property is a property that was owned at July 1, 2015. A  non-same-store  property is a property that was acquired, placed into service or disposed of after July 1, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   18   properties were categorized as same-store properties. 
  The following table presents the same-store and non-same-store results from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

________________ 
           (1) 
    See    Net Operating Income  below for a reconciliation of NOI to net loss. 
     Net Operating Income 
  Same-store net operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $10,729,773   compared to   $10,489,752   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   2.3%     increase   in same-store net operating income was due to a   6.1%     increase   in same-store rental revenues offset by a   11.1%     increase   in same-store operating expenses. 
  Revenues 
  Same-store revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $19,400,743   compared to   $18,293,821   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   6.1%     increase   in same-store revenues was primarily due to average rent increases at the same-store properties from   $939   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $999   as of   September 30, 2016  , as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Same-store operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $8,670,970   compared to   $7,804,069   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in same-store operating expenses was primarily attributable to property tax increases at Preston Hills at Mill Creek, The Residences on McGinnis Ferry and Reveal on Cumberland for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Net Operating Income  
  NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (5) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to us. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner.  
  Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.  
  However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.  
  NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in   Results of Operations  regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
  The following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net loss for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   computed in accordance with GAAP: 

____________________ 
            (2) 
    Other gains and losses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   include non-recurring insurance claim recoveries that are not included in NOI. 
     Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations  
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.  
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 ( White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and non-cash impairment charges of real estate related investments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above.  
  The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO, and MFFO as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.  
  Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that public, non-listed REITs, like us, are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Our board of directors will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that the then-current market conditions are favorable. However, our board of directors does not anticipate evaluating a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of our company or another similar transaction) until five years after the completion of our offering stage. Thus, as a limited life REIT, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.  
  Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a public, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.  
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the  Practice Guideline ), issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we rely on our Advisor for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do not retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such non-recurring gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations.  
  Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the event that proceeds from our Public Offering are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our Advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to our Advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to our stockholders. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.  
  Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other public, non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to public, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.  
  Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance to that of other public, non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all public, non-listed REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other public, non-listed REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no regular net asset value determination during the early stage of the offering. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.  
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.  
  Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

________________ 
           (1) 
    By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties. Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. In the event that proceeds from our Public Offering are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our Advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to the Advisor from other sources, including debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to its stockholders.

  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

FFO and MFFO may be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  We have entered into agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, financing coordination fees, organization and offering costs, sales commissions, dealer manager fees, asset and property management fees and expenses, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. Refer to Note 7 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund the acquisition, expansion and refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. We may be also exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of the acquisition and origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We have managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level. In addition, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, collars, floors and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. 
  We borrow funds and make investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate debt was   $73,697,142   and the carrying value of our fixed rate debt was   $67,769,550  . The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated at   September 30, 2016  . As we expect to hold our fixed rate instruments to maturity and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our operations. 
  Conversely, movements in interest rates on our variable rate debt will change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. However, changes in required risk premiums will result in changes in the fair value of floating rate instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our variable rate debt was   $876,204,333   and the  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

carrying value of our variable rate debt was   $883,705,267  . Based on interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , if interest rates are 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending   September 30, 2017  , interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by   $9,042,227   and if interest rates are 100 basis points lower during the 12 months ending   September 30, 2017  , interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease by   $4,802,417  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt was   4.51%   and   2.60%  , respectively. The weighted-average interest rate of our blended fixed and variable rates was   2.73%   at   September 30, 2016  . The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect at   September 30, 2016   (consisting of the contractual interest rate), using interest rate indices as of   September 30, 2016  , where applicable. 
  We may also be exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have counterparty risk on our interest rate cap agreements as the underlying variable rates for each of our interest rate caps as of   September 30, 2016   were not in excess of the capped rates. See also Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act). Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in Part I, Item 1A set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
  Our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-191049), registering a public offering of up to $1,100,000,000 in shares of our common stock, was declared effective under the Securities Act on December 30, 2013 at which time we commenced our Public Offering. Our Public Offering terminated on March 24, 2016. Upon termination of our Public Offering, we had sold   48,625,651   shares of our common stock, including   1,011,561   shares issued pursuant to the DRP for gross offering proceeds of   $724,849,631  . 
  On April 5, 2016, we registered with the SEC up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock to be issued to existing shareholders pursuant to the DRP. 
  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we had recognized selling commissions, dealer manager fees and organization and other offering costs in our Public Offering in the amounts set forth below. The Dealer Manager for our Public Offering reallowed all of the selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers. 

From the commencement of our Public Offering through   September 30, 2016  , the net offering proceeds to us, after deducting the total expenses incurred as described above, were   $651,557,298  , including net offering proceeds from our DRP of   $26,002,435  . For the period from inception through   September 30, 2016  , the ratio of the cost of raising equity capital to the gross amount of equity capital raised was approximately   11.95%  . 
  The net proceeds from our Public Offering have been used to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of multifamily properties located in targeted markets throughout the United States. In addition to our focus on multifamily properties, we may also make selective strategic acquisitions of other types of commercial properties with the remaining proceeds from our Public Offering. We may also acquire or originate mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate loans and equity securities of other real estate companies. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had invested in   34   multifamily properties for a total purchase price of   $1,499,381,750  . These property acquisitions were funded from proceeds of our Public Offering and   $890,965,019   in secured financings.

  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION (continued) 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we fulfilled repurchase requests and repurchased shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan as follows: 

____________________ 
            (2) 
    Pursuant to the plan, as amended, we currently repurchase shares at prices determined as follows: 
                
    92.5% of the estimated value per share for stockholders who have held their shares for at least one year; 
                
    95.0% of the estimated value per share for stockholders who have held their shares for at least two years; 
                
    97.5% of the estimated value per share for stockholders who have held their shares for at least three years; and 
                
    100% of the estimated value per share for stockholders who have held their shares for at least four years. 
     Notwithstanding the above, the repurchase price for repurchases sought upon a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  will initially be the amount paid to acquire the shares from us.  
           (3) 
    The number of shares that may be repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase plan during any calendar year is limited to: (1) 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year and (2) those that can be funded from the net proceeds we received from the sale of shares under the DRP during the prior calendar year, plus such additional funds as may be reserved for that purpose by our board of directors.
