The

for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures

have:

others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared; 

b) 

Designed such

Evaluated the

reporting.

persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a) 

All significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and

Any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the registrant s internal control
