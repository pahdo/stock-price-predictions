  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. Nature of Business 
  BroadSoft, Inc. ( BroadSoft  or the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1998. The Company is the leading global provider of software and services that enable telecommunications service providers to deliver hosted, cloud-based Unified Communications, or UC, to their enterprise customers.  
   
  2. Financial Statement Presentation 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Interim Financial Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) as contained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual fiscal reporting periods. In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders  equity and cash flows. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or any other period. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic   606 ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard's core principle is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The standard allows entities to apply either of two adoption methods: (a) retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (b) retrospective application with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606   ("ASU 2015-14"), which defers the effective date for ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard on its financial statements and the method of adoption.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,   Leases: Topic 842   ("ASU 2016-02"), which provides updated guidance on lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard on its financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation: Topic 718   ("ASU 2016-09"), which provides updated guidance on several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017 and is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial statements.   
   
  3. Investments and Fair Value Disclosures 
  Investments in Marketable Securities 
  Marketable securities that the Company does not intend to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale, are carried at fair value and are included on the Company s balance sheet as either short-term or long-term investments depending on their maturity. Investments with original maturities greater than   three months   that mature less than one year from the consolidated balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities greater than   one year   from the consolidated balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. Available-for-sale investments are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period, with unrealized holding gains or losses, which represent temporary changes in the fair value of the investment, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders  equity. The Company s primary objective when investing excess cash is preservation of principal. The following table summarizes the Company s investments:

Fair Value 
  The following table summarizes the carrying and fair value of the Company s financial assets (in thousands): 

* Excludes   $56.6 million   and   $52.7 million   of operating cash balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The carrying amounts of the Company s other financial instruments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. (See Note 8   Borrowings   for additional information on the fair value of debt.) 
  The Company uses a three-tier fair value measurement hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The three tiers are defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1  . Observable inputs based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments and include the Company s investments in money market funds and certificates of deposit; 
                
    Level 2  . Inputs valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments, nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data and include the Company s investments and marketable securities in U.S. agency notes, commercial paper, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities; and 
                
    Level 3  . Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The Company evaluates its financial assets subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level of classification for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made. There were no transfers between classification levels during the periods. The following tables summarize the values (in thousands): 

* Excludes   $56.6 million   and   $52.7 million   of operating cash balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  The Company measures certain assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be impaired. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after  initial recognition. 
   
  4. Acquisitions 
  Transera Communications, Inc. 
  On February 4, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the stock of Transera Communications, Inc. ("Transera"), which was renamed BroadSoft Contact Center, Inc. Transera provides cloud-based contact center software and the acquisition enables the Company to offer its customers a comprehensive cloud contact center solution that is complementary to, and integrates with, its BroadWorks and BroadCloud platform. The total consideration paid for Transera was   $19.8 million  , which was funded with cash on hand. The Company incurred   $0.5 million   of transaction costs for financial advisory and legal services related to the acquisition, which costs are included in general and administrative expenses as incurred, in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of Transera from the date of acquisition. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date.

     Table of Contents  
  BroadSoft, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date of February 4, 2016 (in thousands): 

The trade name represents the fair value of the Transera trade name that the Company intends to use for a fixed period of time.  Customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships and agreements with Transera customers. Developed technology represents the fair value of Transera's intellectual property. The trade name, customer relationships and developed technology are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of   three   years,   seven   years and   five   years, respectively, which in general reflects the estimated cash flows to be generated from such assets. The weighted-average amortization period for depreciable intangible assets acquired is approximately   six   years. 
  The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of   $7.8 million   was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill balance is attributable to the assembled workforce and the synergies expected as a result of the acquisition. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill associated with this acquisition will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill associated with this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.  
  Pro Forma Financial Information for Acquisition of Transera (unaudited) 
  Transera contributed revenue of   $5.7 million   and a net loss of   $2.8 million   for the period from the date of acquisition to   September 30, 2016  . 
  The unaudited pro forma statement of operations data below gives effect to the acquisition of Transera as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The following data includes adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and acquisition costs. This pro forma data is presented for information purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of future operations or of the results that would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on January 1, 2015.

5. Goodwill 
  The following table provides a summary of the changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill (in thousands): 

The increase in goodwill related to acquisitions consists of   $7.8 million   of goodwill related to the acquisition of Transera in February 2016,   $1.0 million   of goodwill related to the acquisition of an enterprise messaging-based team communication and collaboration software application company in May 2016 and a   $(0.2) million   measurement period adjustment related to a cloud-based communications provider in Japan acquired in November 2015. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as  Other  in the above table. 
   
  6. Deferred Revenue 
  Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to or collected from customers for which the related revenue has not been recognized because one or more of the revenue recognition criteria have not been met. The current portion of deferred revenue is expected to be recognized as revenue within   12 months   from the balance sheet date. Deferred revenue consisted of the following (in thousands):       

7. Software Licenses 
  The Company has entered into an agreement with a third-party that provides the Company the right to distribute its software on an unlimited basis through December 2020. 
  For the period from June 2012 to May 2016, the Company had a fixed cost associated with these distribution rights of   $10.2 million  , which was amortized to cost of revenue over the   four  -year period beginning in June 2012, based on the straight line method. 
  For the period from June 2016 to December 2020, the Company has a fixed cost associated with these distribution rights of   $17.3 million  , and to the extent billed license software revenue over the extended term exceeds   $850 million  , the Company would be required to pay additional fees. The   $17.3 million   is being amortized to cost of revenue over the extended term beginning June 2016, based on the straight line method. 
  Amortization expense related to this agreement was   $0.9 million   and   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $2.3 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  8. Borrowings 
  2022 Convertible Senior Notes 
  In September 2015, the Company issued   $201.3 million   aggregate principal amount of   1.00%   convertible senior notes due in 2022 (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company, with interest payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of   1.00%   per annum, and will mature on September 1, 2022, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
  The 2022 Notes may be converted by the holders at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (a) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on December 31, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of   30   consecutive trading days ending  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  
  BroadSoft, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (b) during the   five   business day period after any   ten   consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price, as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Notes (the "2022 Indenture"), per   $1,000   principal amount of 2022 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (c) if the Company calls any or all of the 2022 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date; or (d) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.     The 2022 Notes will be convertible, regardless of the foregoing circumstances, at any time from, and including, June 1, 2022 through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
  The initial conversion rate for the 2022 Notes is   25.8249   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of 2022 Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $38.72   per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company issues a notice of redemption on or after September 1, 2019 as described below, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or during the related redemption period in certain circumstances.     Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election. It is the Company's current intent to settle conversions through combination settlement with a specified dollar amount per   $1,000   principal amount of 2022 Notes of   $1,000  . While the 2022 Notes were not convertible as of   September 30, 2016  , if the 2022 Notes were convertible,   shares would have been distributed upon conversion because the conversion price was below the stock price as of such date  . 
  Holders of the 2022 Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of the 2022 Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, as defined in the 2022 Indenture, at a repurchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. 
  The Company may not redeem the 2022 Notes prior to September 1, 2019. Beginning September 1, 2019, the Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the 2022 Notes, at the Company's option, if the last reported sale price of the common stock is equal to or greater than   140%   of the conversion price then in effect for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any   30   consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending within the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes to be redeemed,   plus   accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2022 Notes. 
  The Company has separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instrument by allocating the gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes between the liability component and the embedded conversion option, or equity component. This allocation was done by first estimating an interest rate at the time of issuance for similar notes that do not include the embedded conversion option. This interest rate, estimated at   7.4%  , was used to compute the initial fair value of the liability component of   $131.3 million  . The excess of the gross proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Notes over the initial amount allocated to the liability component of   $70.0 million   was allocated to the embedded conversion option, or equity component. This excess is reported as a debt discount and will be subsequently amortized as interest expense, using the interest method, through September 2022, the maturity date of the 2022 Notes. Offering costs, consisting of the initial purchasers  discount and offering expenses payable by the Company, were   $6.4 million  . These offering costs were allocated to the liability component and the equity component based on the relative valuations of such components. As a result,   $4.2 million   of the offering costs were classified as debt issuance costs and recorded on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. The remaining   $2.2 million   of offering costs were allocated to the equity component. 
  The fair value of the 2022 Notes as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 was   $266.6 million   and   $221.1 million  , respectively. The carrying amount of the equity component of the 2022 Notes was   $61.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The unamortized offering costs classified as debt issuance costs and recorded as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt liability at   September 30, 2016   were   $3.6 million  , which are being amortized as interest expense through the September 2022 maturity date of the 2022 Notes.  
  2018 Convertible Senior Notes 
  In June 2011, the Company issued   $120.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   1.50%   convertible senior notes due in 2018 (the  2018 Notes ). The 2018 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, with interest payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of   1.50%   per annum, and will mature on   July 1, 2018  , unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. 
  Concurrently with the closing of the 2022 Notes offering, the Company repurchased   $50.9 million   principal amount of the 2018 Notes in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of   $53.4 million  . The Company recorded an extinguishment loss of   $4.2 million   on the repurchase, including   $0.5 million   associated with unamortized issuance costs. This

loss was recorded in other expense within the consolidated statement of operations. The remaining purchase price was allocated between the liability component and the equity component based upon the fair value of the debt immediately prior to the repurchase at   $42.4 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively.  
  The 2018 Notes may be converted by the holders at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (a) during the   five   business-day period after any   ten   consecutive trading-day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per 2018 Note for each day of that measurement period was less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day; (b) during any calendar quarter (and only during such quarter) after the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2012, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for   20   or more trading days in a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds   130%   of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (c) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or (d) if the Company calls the 2018 Notes for redemption. The 2018 Notes will be convertible, regardless of the foregoing circumstances, at any time from, and including, April 1, 2018 through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
  The initial conversion rate for the 2018 Notes is   23.8126   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of 2018 Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $41.99   per share of common stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes (the  2018 Indenture ), occurs prior to the maturity date, the Company will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes to be converted and deliver shares of the common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes being converted. While the 2018 Notes were not convertible as of   September 30, 2016  , if the 2018 Notes were convertible,   shares would have been distributed upon conversion because the conversion price was below the stock price as of such date  .  
  Holders of the 2018 Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of the 2018 Notes for cash, subject to certain exceptions, upon a fundamental change, as defined in the 2018 Indenture, at a repurchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the relevant repurchase date. 
  Beginning July 1, 2015, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2018 Notes (except for the 2018 Notes that the Company is required to repurchase as described above) if the last reported sale price of the common stock exceeds   140%   of the applicable conversion price for   20   or more trading days in a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of the redemption notice. The redemption price will equal the sum of   100%   of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus a  make-whole premium  payment. The Company must make the make-whole premium payments on all 2018 Notes called for redemption prior to the maturity date, including 2018 Notes converted after the date the Company delivered the notice of redemption. 
  The Company has separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instrument by allocating the gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes between the liability component and the embedded conversion option, or equity component. This allocation was done by first estimating an interest rate at the time of issuance for similar notes that do not include the embedded conversion option. This interest rate, estimated at   8%  , was used to compute the initial fair value of the liability component of   $79.4 million  . The excess of the gross proceeds received from the issuance of the 2018 Notes over the initial amount allocated to the liability component, of   $40.6 million  , was allocated to the embedded conversion option, or equity component. This excess is reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized as interest expense, using the interest method, through July 2018, the maturity date of the 2018 Notes. Offering costs, consisting of the initial purchasers  discount and offering expenses payable by the Company, were   $4.3 million  . These offering costs were allocated to the liability component and the equity component based on the relative valuations of such components. As a result,   $2.9 million   of the offering costs were classified as debt issuance costs and recorded on the balance sheet in other assets. The remaining   $1.4 million   of offering costs were allocated to the equity component. 
  The fair value of the 2018 Notes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $84.3 million   and   $75.3 million  , respectively. The carrying amount of the equity component of the 2018 Notes was   $7.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The unamortized offering costs classified as debt issuance costs and recorded as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt liability at   September 30, 2016   were   $0.4 million  , which is being amortized as interest expense through the July 2018 maturity date of the 2018 Notes.

  The fair value for the Company s borrowings is estimated using quoted market prices of the Notes at   September 30, 2016  , quoted market prices for similar instruments and by observable market data. The Company believes its creditworthiness and the financial market in which it operates have not materially changed since entering into the arrangements. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The aggregate maturities of borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

9. Stock-based Compensation 
  Equity Incentive Plans 
  In 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the  1999 Plan ). The 1999 Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights. The 1999 Plan terminated in June 2009 whereby no new options or awards are permitted to be granted. In April 2009, the Company adopted the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. This plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and stock appreciation rights. In June 2010, in connection with the Company s initial public offering ( IPO ), the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan was amended and restated to provide for, among other things, annual increases in the share reserve (as amended and restated, the  2009 Plan ).  
  The term of stock-based grants is up to   ten years  , except that certain stock-based grants made after 2005 have a term of   five years  . For grants made under the 2009 Plan prior to January 1, 2015, the requisite vesting period is typically   four years   and for grants made subsequent to January 1, 2015, the requisite vesting period is typically   three years  . On each of January 1,   2015   and   2016  ,   1,250,000   shares were added to the 2009 Plan. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   794,538   shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2009 Plan.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Company was as follows (in thousands): 

Stock Options 
  The following table presents summary information related to stock options: 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company granted stock options with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $16.14   and   $15.73  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the intrinsic value of stock options exercised was   $4.3 million   and   $3.7 million  , respectively, and cash received from stock options exercised was   $13.9 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options was   $13.6 million  , which is scheduled to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.94   years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different than what the Company has anticipated at   September 30, 2016  , stock-based compensation expense will be different from expectations.  
  Restricted Stock Units 
  The following table presents a summary of activity for RSUs (excluding RSUs that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions ( PSUs )): 

17 

     Table of Contents  
  BroadSoft, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The RSUs generally vest over   three   or   four years   from the vesting commencement date and on vesting the holder receives   one   share of common stock for each RSU.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested RSUs was   $61.0 million  , which is scheduled to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.97   years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different than what the Company has anticipated at   September 30, 2016  , stock-based compensation expense will be different from expectations.  
  Performance Stock Units 
  The following table presents a summary of activity for PSUs: 

The PSUs generally vest over   three   or   four   years from the vesting commencement date, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, and on vesting the holder receives   one   share of common stock for each PSU. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reversed   $1.4 million   of expense related to the change in estimate of the number of shares expected to vest based upon the satisfaction of certain financial performance conditions. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested PSUs was   $0.2 million  , which is scheduled to be recognized over a weighted average period of   0.66   years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate or estimated financial performance conditions are different than what the Company has anticipated at   September 30, 2016  , stock-based compensation expense will be different from expectations.  
  Tax Benefits 
  In accordance with the FASB s guidance on stock-based compensation, the Company elected the alternative transition method (short cut method) provided for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ( APIC pool ) related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash flows related to the tax effect of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance of the Company s APIC pool related to tax windfall benefits from stock option exercises was   $10.9 million  . 
  The Company applies a with-and-without approach in determining its intra-period allocation of tax expense or benefit attributable to stock-based compensation deductions. Tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits (windfalls) included in net operating loss carryforwards but not reflected in deferred tax assets were   $53.5 million   and   $50.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  10. Commitments and Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that may contain representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made in the future, but have not yet been made. The Company has not paid any material claims related to indemnification obligations to date. 
  In accordance with its bylaws and certain agreements, the Company has indemnification obligations to its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they are serving at the Company s request in such capacity. There have been no claims to date under these indemnification obligations.

In addition, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company is not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in the opinion of management, is reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  11. Taxes 
  The Company s provision for income taxes is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes. Where the Company has entities with losses and does not expect to realize the tax benefits in the foreseeable future, those entities are excluded from the effective tax rate calculation. Non-recurring and discrete items that impact tax expense are recorded in the period incurred. 
  The effective tax rate was   33.7%   and   31.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rate differs from the computed U.S. statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible expenses related to stock-based compensation, other compensation items and losses from certain foreign jurisdictions with no associated tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance, partially offset by research and development and business credits. Included in the effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is a discrete benefit of   $2.1 million   related to additional U.S. research and development credits claimed for the prior years. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of   $10.8 million   of certain foreign subsidiaries, since such earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. If the earnings were distributed, the Company would be subject to federal income and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of an unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.  
  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets in each relevant jurisdiction. The Company provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based upon the weight of available evidence, we do not believe it is  more-likely-than-not  that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets in any jurisdictions depends on various factors, including the expectation of future profitability in that jurisdiction.  
  Realization of the U.S. deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of these U.S. loss carryforwards.  During the prior years and currently, the Company experienced losses in its U.S. jurisdiction, driven largely by significant stock-based compensation expense recorded in those years. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the results of U.S. operations will generate sufficient taxable income to support the realization of the existing deferred tax asset and any excess stock-based compensation deduction carryforwards prior to the expiration of those losses. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. 
   
  12. Income (loss) per share data 
  Basic income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted income per common share adjusts the basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, RSUs and convertible securities were exercised or converted into common stock. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation. In the table below, net loss represents the numerator and weighted average common shares outstanding represent the denominator: 

Due to the settlement features of the Notes, the Company only includes the impact of the premium feature in the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the average stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted loss per share does not include the effect of the premium feature of the 2022 Notes convertible into   686,211   and   167,570   shares for the three and nine months ended   September 30,     2016  , respectively, and does not include the effect of the premium feature of the 2018 Notes convertible into   96,636   share for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as the effect would have been anti-dilutive given the Company's loss for these  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

periods. The average stock price did not exceed the conversion price for the 2022 Notes for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015   or exceed the conversion price for the 2018 Notes for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2015  . 
  The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted loss per share does not include the effect of stock-based awards convertible into   923,561   and   508,377   shares for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and into   888,171   and   633,990   shares for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive given the Company s losses for these periods.  
  The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted loss per share also does not include the effect of certain additional stock-based awards exercisable into   265,546   and   1,488,820   shares for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and into   1,090,717   and   1,606,984   shares for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive because their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of the Company's common stock during these periods. 
   
  13. Segment and Geographic Information 
  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer (the  CEO ). The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, along with information about revenue by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Discrete information on a geographic basis, except for revenue, is not provided below the consolidated level to the CEO. The Company has concluded that it operates in   one   segment and has provided the required enterprise-wide disclosures. 
  The Company engages in business across three geographic regions: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia Pacific, the Caribbean and Latin America ("Emerging Markets"). Revenue by geographic area is based on the location of the service provider. The following tables present revenue and long-lived assets, net, by geographic area (in thousands):          

  North America includes   $38.5 million   and   $36.9 million   of United States revenue for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $119.4 million   and   $107.9 million   for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   

  North America includes   $20.3 million   and   $20.9 million   of United States long-lived assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  14. Subsequent Events 
  On October 28, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding units of VoIP Logic, LLC, a wholesale provider of BroadWorks-based cloud communications services. This cloud offering will be added to the Company's BroadCloud portfolio and addresses the needs of service providers who want greater control of their platform and to maintain their own administrative systems. The total consideration paid for VoIP Logic was   $13.4 million  , funded with cash on hand. The Company has not yet allocated the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities.

  Overview 
  We are the leading global provider of software and services that enable telecommunications service providers to deliver hosted, cloud-based Unified Communications, or UC, to their enterprise customers. 
  Traditionally, many enterprises have utilized premise-based private branch exchanges, or PBX s, to connect their offices and people to public telephony networks. Hosted UC enables the delivery of PBX features without the need for premise-based equipment. Hosted UC can be delivered through service providers using their own internet protocol, or IP-based networks and their mobile networks, as well as over the public internet (also known as "over the top" or OTT). In addition to voice telephony, UC offers additional features such as full integration with mobile devices, high definition, or HD, voice and video calling and conferencing, instant messaging and presence, or IM P, and web collaboration.

     Table of Contents  

We believe we are well positioned to enable service providers to capitalize on increasing demand by enterprises for such UC services by enabling them to efficiently and cost-effectively offer a broad suite of services to their end-users. Our service provider customers, who are located in more than   80   countries, are delivering services and have deployed over   13 million   UC subscriber lines worldwide using our software. We count among our customers   25   of the top 30 telecommunications service providers globally, as measured by revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  UC-One 
  UC-One, our UC solution, is a communications and collaboration offering that enables telecommunications service providers to offer businesses and other enterprises UC features and functionalities on a hosted basis without the need for traditional premise-based PBX equipment. Our technology is designed to meet service providers  stringent requirements for service availability, network integration and scale and to address the needs of various business segments, such as micro, small, medium and large enterprises; market segments such as hospitality, government, education, contact centers and healthcare; and industries requiring call center functionality.  
  Our UC-One services include HD voice and video calling, audio conferencing, IM P, desktop sharing and collaboration and call center capabilities.  Because these capabilities can be accessed through desk phones, smartphones, tablets, laptops and PCs, UC-One provides full support for today s distributed workforce and mobile employees. Our solution can also be deployed across multiple access networks and technologies, including fixed line/fiber and traditional mobile 3G networks, as well as voice over LTE, or VoLTE, networks and voice over wifi, or VoWiFi. 
  The benefits of UC-One to enterprises and end users include: 
             
    Solution Breadth and Flexibility  . UC-One is scalable and can be used by businesses of varying sizes, from very small businesses of two employees to the largest global enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees in multiple locations. Capacity can be purchased as needed by enterprises in response to business and operational needs. 
                
    Multi-Location and Ease of Use  . Because UC-One is cloud and IP-based, an enterprise can provide uniform communications functionality across its entire organization, enabling a consistent and simplified user experience. It also provides a single console to manage all the communication and collaboration needs for businesses with geographically dispersed offices and mobile workers, greatly streamlining business operations and reducing operational costs. 
                
    Enhanced Mobility  .  Our solution provides the flexibility to work from the office, at home or on the move, with the full range of UC-One services available irrespective of location or end user device. 
                
    Business Continuity  .  Because UC-One is cloud-based, in the event an enterprise has a business interruption issue, the enterprise s core communications and collaboration services would remain unaffected. 
                
    Openness  .  We have an active ecosystem of development partners who use our open APIs to create complementary offerings designed for specific market segments or industry verticals. 
                
    Lower Total Cost of Ownership  .  We believe that enterprises will experience a lower total cost of ownership compared to legacy premise-based solutions.  Because it is cloud-based, there are significantly lower capital investment requirements, fewer highly trained personnel required and reduced costs given the inherent flexibility of per-user based costs.  
     We offer service providers two deployment options, software and software-as-a-service, or SaaS, to enable them to offer UC services to their enterprise customers:  
  Software.   BroadWorks is our application server software offering, with the software generally deployed on industry-standard servers located in the service provider s data centers.  With BroadWorks implemented as an application server in its infrastructure, the service provider is responsible for the development and implementation of the overall solution and integration with the service provider s network, operations, support and billing systems.  This deployment model gives the service provider the maximum flexibility to define its UC-One offering.  In this model, revenue is derived from perpetual software license and annual maintenance and support fees, as well as associated professional services. Since our inception, the majority of our revenue has been derived from such software licensing. 
  SaaS.   The second deployment option is our BroadCloud SaaS offering. BroadCloud provides a managed services offering for service providers.  In this model, we have implemented UC-One and other BroadWorks capabilities within our own data centers and provide operations capabilities covering sales and order management, service delivery, device provisioning, customer service and billing. We believe that through BroadCloud, service providers can accelerate their deployments of UC-One services and reduce their capital expenditures and the internal costs of implementing UC services. Generally, service providers

     Table of Contents  

utilizing our BroadCloud offering pay us on a monthly recurring basis based on the total number of subscriber lines the service provider has deployed.  
  Other Products 
  We also offer to our service provider customers SIP Trunking and Voice over IP, or VoIP, consumer solutions based on our BroadWorks software. 
  SIP Trunking.    Our BroadWorks  SIP Trunking solution enables service providers to provide IP interconnectivity and additional services to enterprises that already have premise-based PBXs. With SIP Trunking, service providers are able to bundle voice and data over a single converged IP pipe, creating a more economical offering than can be achieved with separate voice and data connections. We believe our solution enables service providers to differentiate their SIP Trunking service offerings and increase revenue by offering enhanced services such as UC, video, mobility, global four-digit dialing and business continuity. 
  BroadSoft Consumer Applications.    Our consumer IP applications allow service providers to offer consumers voice and multimedia telephony services with voice calling, video calling, enhanced messaging and content sharing over broadband and VoLTE networks. 
  Company 
  We were incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and we began selling BroadWorks in 2001. We sell our products to service providers both directly and indirectly through distribution partners, such as telecommunications equipment vendors, value-added resellers, or VARs, and other distributors. 
   
  Industry 
  Traditionally, many enterprises have used premise-based PBX s to connect their offices and people to the public telephone network. These PBX offerings were primarily voice communications based. We believe several trends are driving enterprises of all sizes to embrace the change from premise-based to cloud-based delivery of PBX functionality: 
             
    The increasing demand by enterprises to move business applications to the cloud for operational savings, flexibility and expanded services; 
                
    The desire by enterprises to drive greater team collaboration and workplace productivity through communications and collaboration tools; 
                
    The demand by enterprises to offer broader communications services such as HD voice and video calling and conferencing across their organizations; 
                
    The increasingly distributed nature of enterprises  operations and workforces and the desire to provide fully integrated UC to them; 
                
    The proliferation of mobile devices used by employees and other workers; and 
                
    The rapid expansion of high quality IP bandwidth, particularly the expansion of wireless bandwidth such as Wi-Fi and VoLTE. 
     We believe that service providers are well-positioned to address these market demands.  A number of our service provider customers have made significant investments in their IP-based and mobile networks and are already offering standard communications services such as broadband access and fixed and mobile calling plans.  Many have a long track record of reliably delivering these business critical services. We believe that as UC solutions are increasingly being offered over fixed- 
  line and mobile networks, service providers can achieve significant competitive advantages in delivering such services over their networks. Further, we believe service providers have a significant incentive to offer UC services to their enterprise customers as competitive and regulatory pressures have commoditized their historical revenue streams.  
  In addition, we believe that larger service providers are becoming more focused on implementing transformations of their fixed and mobile networks from traditional circuit switched networks to their IP-based broadband networks. As these service providers embark on such projects, they are incorporating application servers like BroadWorks to enable them to offer enhanced business services that were previously offered over their circuit switched networks.  We believe this emerging trend is evident in both fixed-line transformations and increasingly in service providers  investment in their mobile VoLTE networks. We believe this trend is a positive development for us, as service providers both replace services to their business users on their traditional networks and provide new business services. 
   
  Our Strategy 
  Our goal is to strengthen our position as the leading provider of software and services that enable service providers to deliver cloud-based UC to their enterprise customers.  To achieve this goal, our strategy is to deliver an increasingly feature rich set of services to address the needs of a broader spectrum of business customer types.  Key elements of our strategy include: 
             
    Extend our technology leadership and product depth and breadth  .  We intend to continue to provide industry leading UC solutions through product innovation and substantial investment in research and development for new features, applications and services. 
                
    Accelerate the adoption of UC solutions by providing communications centric UC and collaboration capabilities.   Project Tempo is our vision of extending UC to help drive how enterprises and people communicate, interact and collaborate by integrating their communication and collaborative tools with contextual intelligence. We also intend to accelerate UC adoption and our service provider customers  time to market by promoting and expanding our UC offerings.  Our BroadCloud solution enables our service providers to offer UC features and functions through a service offering that we host and manage. We also intend to expand the geographic availability of our BroadCloud offerings beyond the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and France. 
                
    Broaden demand by enterprises and assist our service provider customers by developing more market segment directed UC offerings  . We enable service providers to develop UC offerings targeted towards specific business segments, including small, medium and large enterprises and market segments such as hospitality, government, education, contact center and healthcare.  
                
    Drive revenue growth by  : 
                
    Assisting our current service provider customers to sell more of their currently deployed BroadWorks and BroadCloud offerings  . We support our service provider customers by regularly offering enhanced and new features to their current applications, as well as providing tools and training to help them market their services to subscribers. 
                
    Expanding our BroadCloud offering  . We believe that service providers will increasingly find that using our BroadCloud offering to deliver UC solutions to their customers will accelerate their time to market and product introduction cycles.  
                
    Continuing to acquire new customers  . Our customers are located around the world and include many of the top telecommunications services providers globally. We believe we are well positioned to continue to acquire new customers, particularly with the addition of our BroadCloud offering and our focus on developing UC solutions based on enterprise size and vertical market segments. 
                
    Pursuing selected acquisitions and collaborations that complement our strategy  .    We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and collaborations that we believe are strategic to strengthen our industry leadership position, expand our geographic presence or allow us to offer new or complementary products or services. 
      
  Executive Summary 
  Our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key industry trends and performance indicators to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. 
  We believe the trend towards adoption of cloud-based unified communications by enterprises will continue and even accelerate over the next several years. We also believe that service providers using our products and services are strongly positioned to  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

take advantage of this demand. Our objective is to provide our service provider customers with the service and software offerings they need to effectively address this market opportunity and their end-user customer needs.  
  We expect continued revenue growth from our UC solutions during the remainder of 2016, which growth we believe is largely driven by increased market acceptance of hosted UC offerings and our continued market leadership. We believe converged and mobile operators desire to deliver UC solutions to their enterprise customer base to grow revenue, reduce subscriber turnover, or churn, and raise average revenue per user. Our UC-One solutions, which are either delivered through our SaaS UC offerings or through our BroadWorks server software that resides within the service provider s network, enable service providers to rapidly and efficiently deliver a UC experience regardless of end-user device and whether or not the end-user has fixed-line or wireless access. In addition, we believe that mobile network centric UC offerings will become an increasingly important trend in the UC market, and we believe that our service provider customers are in a strong position to take advantage of this market trend. This year, major service provider customers of ours, such as Verizon Wireless, Rogers Communications and Vodafone Germany, have announced and are marketing such mobile centric offerings based on our BroadWorks platform. 
  During 2016, our SaaS offerings have been, and for the remainder of this year will continue to be a particularly important area of investment and marketing focus for us. Many of our service provider customers are interested in accessing the capabilities of our BroadWorks features and functions through a service offering hosted and managed by us. We believe that service providers choose our SaaS offerings to accelerate their time to market and reduce their capital and implementation costs and that delivering innovative solutions to our customers will drive our revenue growth. While our SaaS business continues to grow, we do not expect the same pace of growth during the remainder of 2016. We expect this growth rate to decline, in part due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union on our pound-denominated cloud revenue in the United Kingdom. During the remainder of 2016, we expect to continue to invest in our SaaS offerings and expand the geographic availability of these offerings.  
  We are expanding our UC-One capabilities by enabling enterprises and people to be more flexible and dynamically communicate, interact and collaborate by helping them integrate their communication and collaborative tools. Our goal is to enable service providers to adopt UC-One as the centerpiece in what we have entitled "The Future of Work." As an example, we are adding team (or enterprise) messaging capabilities into our UC-One communications experience, increasing the collaboration and communications capabilities of our UC-One offerings. We expect that during the remainder of 2016, we will continue our strategic investments in these and other initiatives and in research and development of existing and new products, such as client and portal software, mobility and cloud-based services, and products acquired in connection with our acquisitions.  
  We believe that many of the largest carriers in the world are embarking on projects to ultimately transform most, if not all, of their legacy fixed and mobile circuit switched networks to IP-based networks, driven in part by the movement to migrate their wireless networks to VoLTE. We think that we are well-positioned to meet such carrier demand for these transformation projects, especially with regard to our UC and UC for VoLTE offerings. We have achieved thus far this year, and expect to achieve during the remainder of 2016, significant positive revenue impact from these projects and believe transformation projects by certain of our largest service provider customers could drive significant growth for us over the next several years.

      For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, please refer to  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  included elsewhere in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
   
  Components of Operating Results 
  Revenue 
  We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of license software, subscription and maintenance support and professional services. We recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met in accordance with revenue recognition guidance. This guidance provides that revenue should be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
  Our total revenue consists of the following: 
  License software  . We derive license software revenue primarily from the sale of perpetual software licenses. We generally price our software based on the packages of features and applications provided and on the number of subscriber licenses sold. These factors impact the average selling price of our licenses and the comparability of average selling prices. Our license software revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year as a result of long sales and deployment cycles, variations in customer ordering practices and the application of management s judgment in applying complex revenue recognition rules. Our deferred license software revenue balance consists of software orders that do not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition. We are unable to predict with certainty the proportion of orders that will meet all the criteria for revenue recognition relative to those orders that will not meet all such criteria and, as a result, it is difficult to forecast whether recognized license software revenue and deferred license software revenue will continue to increase or decrease in a given period. As of   September 30, 2016  , our deferred license software revenue balance was   $19.5 million  , the current portion of which was   $19.3 million  . 
  Subscription and maintenance support  . Subscription and maintenance support revenue includes recurring revenue from annual maintenance support contracts for our software licenses and from subscriptions related to our delivery of SaaS offering.  
  Rates for maintenance support, including subsequent renewal rates, are typically established based upon a specific percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement with the customer. Maintenance support revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance support period, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our annual maintenance support contracts provide for software updates, upgrades and technical support. Our typical warranty on licensed software is 90 days and, during this period, our customers are entitled to receive maintenance and support without the purchase of a maintenance contract. After the expiration of the warranty period, our customers must purchase maintenance support services to continue receiving such support. 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

With respect to our SaaS subscriptions, we are paid a recurring fee typically calculated based on the number of seats and type of services purchased or a usage fee based on the actual number of transactions. The recurring fee is typically billed monthly. 
  Our deferred subscription and maintenance support revenue balance consists of maintenance support and subscription orders that do not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition. As of   September 30, 2016  , our deferred subscription and maintenance support revenue balance was   $58.2 million  , the current portion of which was   $53.0 million  . 
  Professional services and other  . Professional services and other revenue primarily includes revenue from professional service engagements consisting of implementation, training, consulting and design and customization services. Our professional services and other deferred revenue balance consists of orders that do not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition. As of   September 30, 2016  , our deferred professional services and other revenue balance was   $24.4 million  , the current portion of which was   $23.6 million  . 
  Cost of Revenue 
  Our total cost of revenue consists of the following: 
             
    Cost of license software revenue  . A majority of the cost of license software revenue consists of amortization of acquired intangibles, personnel-related expenses and royalties paid to third parties whose technology or products are sold as part of BroadWorks. A significant amount of the royalty fees are for the underlying embedded data base technology within BroadWorks for which we currently incur a fixed expense per quarter. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, benefits, bonuses, reimbursement of expenses and stock-based compensation. Such costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
                
    Cost of subscription and maintenance support revenue  . Cost of subscription and maintenance support revenue consists primarily of personnel-related expenses and other direct costs associated with support and maintenance obligations to our customers who have licensed our software and SaaS offerings, including maintenance and support expenses due to our use of third party software, amortization of acquired intangibles and operating and depreciation expenses associated with the delivery of SaaS offerings. 
                
    Cost of professional services and other revenue  . Cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related expenses and other direct costs associated with the delivery of our professional services, which are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
     Gross Profit 
  Gross profit is the calculation of total revenue minus cost of revenue. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including: 
             
    Mix of license software, subscription and maintenance support and professional services and other revenue  . We generate higher gross margins on license software revenue compared to subscription and maintenance support or professional services and other revenue. 
                
    Growth or decline of license software revenue  . A significant portion of cost of license software revenue is fixed and is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. This cost consists primarily of royalty fees to our embedded database provider and amortization of acquired technology. If license software revenue increases, these fixed fees will decline as a percentage of revenue. If license software revenue declines, these fixed fees will increase as a percentage of revenue. 
                
    Impact of deferred revenue  . If any revenue recognition criteria have not been met, the applicable revenue derived from the arrangement is deferred, including license software, subscription and maintenance support, and professional services and other revenue, until all elements of revenue recognition criteria have been met. However, the cost of revenue, including the costs of license software, subscription and maintenance support and professional services and other, is typically expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Therefore, if relatively more revenue is deferred in a particular period, gross margin would decline in that period. Because the ability to recognize revenue on orders depends largely on the terms of the sale arrangement and we are not able to predict with certainty the proportion of orders that will not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition, we cannot forecast whether any historical trends in gross margin will continue. 
                
    Intangible amortization related to mergers and acquisitions.   Over the last several years, our business combinations resulted in a number of intangibles assets. These intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, resulting in  
     
   26 

     Table of Contents  

additional expense impacting gross profit over the applicable period. We may undertake additional strategic transactions in the future that would result in additional intangible amortization expense. 
  Billings (Revenue Plus Net Change in Deferred Revenue) 
  We believe billings, which we calculate as revenue plus the net change in our deferred revenue balance for a particular period, is a key measure of our sales activity for that period. 
  Billings are as follows (in thousands): 

Operating Expenses 
  We grew our total headcount to 1,522 employees at   September 30, 2016   from 1,247 employees at   December 31, 2015  , and we expect to continue hiring additional employees to support our anticipated growth. 
  Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and other personnel costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect our operating expenses to increase in 2016 primarily due to increases in headcount and personnel-costs, including stock-based compensation expense. 
  Sales and marketing expenses  . Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees, including stock-based compensation, commissions, benefits and bonuses. Additional expenses include marketing programs, consulting, travel and other related overhead.  
  Research and development expenses  . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for development employees, including stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses. Additional expenses include costs related to development, quality assurance and testing of new software and enhancement of existing software, consulting, travel and other related overhead. We engage third-party international and domestic consulting firms for various research and development efforts, such as software development, documentation, quality assurance and software support. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts, including by hiring additional development personnel and by using third-party consulting firms for various research and development efforts. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position.  
  General and administrative expenses  . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and personnel costs for administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources employees, including stock-based compensation, benefits and bonuses. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, travel, insurance and other administrative expenses.  
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  We include stock-based compensation as part of cost of revenue and operating expenses in connection with the grant of stock-based awards to our directors, employees and consultants. We apply the fair value method in accordance with authoritative guidance for determining the cost of stock-based compensation. The total cost of the grant is measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the date of grant. The fair value of service-only awards is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, of the award. The fair value of awards with a performance condition is recognized as stock-based compensation on a graded basis over the requisite vesting period of the award. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded stock-based compensation expense of   $14.0 million   and   $9.2 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded stock-based compensation expense of   $38.3 million   and   $30.4 million  , respectively.  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Based on stock-based awards outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , we expect to recognize future expense related to the non-vested portions of such stock-based awards in the amount of   $74.8 million   over a weighted average period of approximately   1.96 years  . 
  Other Expense, Net 
  Other expense, net, consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest related to our 2018 convertible senior notes, or the 2018 Notes, and our 2022 convertible senior notes, or the 2022 Notes. Loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes relates to the fair value in excess of the carrying value of the portion of the 2018 Notes repurchased. Foreign exchange gains and losses relate to the revaluation of foreign currency denominated trade receivables.   
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. We are required to pay income taxes in certain states and foreign jurisdictions. Historically, we have not been required to pay significant U.S. federal income taxes due to our accumulated net operating losses.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic   606 ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The standard allows entities to apply either of two methods: (a) retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (b) retrospective application with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606   ("ASU 2015-14"), which defers the effective date for ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard on our financial statements and our method of adoption.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,   Leases: Topic 842   ("ASU 2016-02"), which provides updated guidance on lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard on our financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation: Topic 718   ("ASU 2016-09"), which provides updated guidance on several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017 and we are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to a   $15.2 million   increase due to the aggregate change in non-cash items, a   $7.9 million   increase from the net change in other current and long-term assets and liabilities and a decrease in net loss of   $6.4 million  . Non-cash items primarily consist of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, provision for deferred income taxes, tax windfall benefits from stock option exercises, non-cash interest on convertible debt and amortization of software licenses.

  Borrowings and Credit Facilities 
  2022 Convertible Senior Notes 
  In September 2015, we issued $201.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, with net proceeds of $195.2 million. The 2022 Notes are general unsecured obligations, with interest payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 1.0% per annum, and will mature on September 1, 2022, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. 
  The initial conversion price for the 2022 Notes is approximately $38.72 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we issue a notice of redemption on or after September 1, 2019 as described below, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or during the related redemption period in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle conversions through combination settlement with a specified dollar amount per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes of $1,000. See Note 8,   Borrowings  , contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details about the 2022 Notes. 
  2018 Convertible Senior Notes 
  In June 2011, we issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes, with net proceeds of $116 million. The 2018 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, with interest payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 1.50% per annum, and will mature on July 1, 2018, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we repurchased an aggregate of $50.9 million principal amount in outstanding 2018 Notes. We have not repurchased any additional outstanding 2018 Notes.   
  The initial conversion price for the 2018 Notes is approximately $41.99 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes to be converted and deliver shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes being converted. See Note 8,   Borrowings  , contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details about the 2018 Notes. 
  Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements 
  We believe that the cash generated from operations, our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investment balances and interest income we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. In the future, we expect our operating and capital expenditures to grow, through organic growth and

     Table of Contents  

acquisitions, as we increase headcount, expand our business activities, grow our customer base and implement and enhance our information technology and enterprise resource planning systems. As sales grow, we expect our accounts receivable balance to increase. Any such increase in accounts receivable may not be completely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which would likely result in greater working capital requirements. 
  If our available cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or enter into a credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  We have contractual obligations for non-cancelable office space, notes payable and other short-term and long-term liabilities. The following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   and periods in which payments are due (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.0 million, including interest and penalties of $0.4 million. We do not expect to recognize any of these benefits in   2016  . Furthermore, we are not able to provide a reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these unrecognized benefits. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In addition to our GAAP operating results, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of certain non-cash expenses, such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, non-cash interest expense on our convertible senior notes and non-cash tax benefit or expense included in our tax provision, so management and investors can compare our core business operating results over multiple periods. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. 
  The presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating expenses and other non-GAAP financial measures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is not meant to be a substitute for  net income,   net income per share,   cost of revenue,   gross profit,   income from operations,  "operating expenses" or other financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such data. Our definition of  non-GAAP net income,   non-GAAP net income per share,   non-GAAP gross profit,   non-GAAP income from operations," "non-GAAP operating expenses" and other non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies and may differ from period to period. In reporting non-GAAP measures in the future, we may make other adjustments for expenses and gains we do not consider reflective of core operating performance in a particular period and may modify  non-GAAP net income,   non-GAAP net income per share,   non-GAAP gross profit,   non-GAAP income from operations  and such other non-GAAP measures by excluding these expenses and gains. 
  Non-GAAP cost of revenue, license software cost of revenue, subscription and maintenance cost of revenue and professional services and other cost of revenue.   We define non-GAAP cost of revenue as a cost of revenue less stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. We consider non-GAAP cost of revenue to be a useful metric for management and our investors because it excludes the effect of certain non-cash expenses so management and investors can compare our cost of revenue over multiple periods. 
  Non-GAAP gross profit, license software gross profit, subscription and maintenance support gross profit and professional services and other gross profit  . We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit plus stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. We consider non-GAAP gross profit to be a useful metric for management and our investors because it excludes the effect of certain non-cash expenses so management and investors can compare our sales margins over multiple periods. 
  Non-GAAP income from operations  . We define non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations plus stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. We consider non-GAAP income from operations to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of certain non-cash expenses so management and investors can compare our core business operating results over multiple periods.

Non-GAAP operating expenses, sales and marketing expense, research and development expense and general and administrative expense  . We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expense less stock-based compensation expense allocated to sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Similarly, we define non-GAAP sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses as the relevant GAAP measure less stock-based compensation expense allocated to the particular expense item. 
  Non-GAAP net income and net income per share  . We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, non-cash interest expense on our convertible senior notes, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, loss on repurchase of our convertible senior notes and non-cash tax expense included in the GAAP tax provision. We define non-GAAP income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding.

ITEM 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative, hedging or trading purposes, although in the future we may enter into interest rate or exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described below. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The interest rate is fixed on all our outstanding loan balances; consequently, we do not have exposure to risks due to increases in the variable rates tied to indexes. We maintain a short-term investment portfolio consisting mainly of highly liquid short-term money market funds, which we consider to be cash equivalents. These securities and investments earn interest at variable rates and, as a result, decreases in market interest rates would generally result in decreased interest income. At   September 30, 2016  , we had long-term debt of $270.4 million associated with our convertible senior notes, which are fixed rate instruments. We would not expect a 10% change in interest rates to have a material impact on our results of operations. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro and British Pound, the currencies of countries where we currently have our most significant international operations. On a historical basis, invoicing has largely been denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we expect an increasing proportion of our future business to be conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In particular, invoices for our SaaS offerings are denominated in local currencies, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk, and we expect this risk to increase as SaaS revenue grows as a proportion of our total revenue. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, with our most significant operations at present located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and India. As a result, our results of operations would generally be adversely affected by a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies. However, we believe this net exposure is not material at this time. As we continue to grow our international operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely become more significant. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. 
  Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in U.S. Dollars would be impacted by a significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.  Based on our cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currencies at   September 30, 2016  , if overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $2.6 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash and cash equivalents balances  ,   although the actual effects may differ materially from this hypothetical analysis.

ITEM 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    Legal Proceedings 
     From time to time, we are a defendant in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcomes of these cases, we are not a party to any material, pending legal proceeding, nor are we aware of any pending legal proceeding to which any of our officers, directors, or any beneficial holders of 5% or more of our common stock are adverse to us or have a material interest adverse to us. 
   
           ITEM 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in risk factors from those disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on   February 25, 2015  . 
  Any significant disruption in our SaaS hosting network infrastructure, interruptions or delays in services, whether caused by us or third parties on whom we rely, could impair the delivery of our products and harm our business.  
  We currently host our BroadCloud service and provide such services on a SaaS basis to our service provider customers. This hosting network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations and we rely on third parties to provide certain portions of this infrastructure. We do not control the operations of the third-party infrastructure providers on which some of our cloud services are deployed and BroadCloud, and these facilities, are vulnerable to any information security breaches, power outages, telecommunications failures or other issues that the data center may experience. Our third party data center providers are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these disasters or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Furthermore, the availability of our platform could be interrupted by a number of additional factors, including our customers  inability to access the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems due to human or other error, security breaches or ability of the infrastructure to handle spikes in customer usage. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to such factors. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties under our agreements with certain customers, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.
