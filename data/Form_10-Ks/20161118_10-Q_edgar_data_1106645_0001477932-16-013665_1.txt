     Table of Contents            DEBT RESOLVE, INC.     NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016       NOTE 1   BASIS AND BUSINESS PRESENTATION      Debt Resolve, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 21, 1997. The Company offers its service as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, enabling clients to introduce this collection or payment software option with no modifications to their existing collections computer systems. Its products capitalize on using the Internet as a tool for communication, resolution, settlement and payment of delinquent or defaulted consumer debt and as part of a complete accounts receivable management solution for consumer creditors.     In December 2014, the Company, jointly with LSH, LLC, organized Progress Advocates LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose to provide services in the student loan document preparation industry with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and LSH, LLC, respectively.      In February 2016, the Company, jointly with Patient Online Services, LLC, organized Payment Resolution Systems LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of assisting Medical Groups and Hospitals in the online negotiation and settlement of delinquent accounts, with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and Patient Online Services, LLC, respectively.      In May 2016, the Company, jointly with Hutton Ventures LLC, organized Student Loan Care LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of providing document preparation services for holders of Federal Direct Student Loans, with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and Hutton Ventures LLC, respectively.      The Company operates Payment Resolution Systems within Debt Resolve, Inc., whereas Progress Advocates LLC and Student Loan Care LLC operate as independent subsidiaries.       Basis of Presentation      These unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and therefore, do not include all the information necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated December 31, 2015 financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interest represents the minority owners' share of its net operating results.                  7       
     Table of Contents          DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016       NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements follows:       Restatement      During the preparation of its financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company identified errors in the presentation of our Accounts Receivable reported as of December 31, 2015. Based on our reassessment of relevant accounting guidelines, we have corrected the error and characterized a portion of Accounts Receivable, as a long term asset, rather than current asset. The effect of these adjustments is a reclassification of $2,508,573 of reported accounts receivable as a long term asset. There was no change to any other asset or liability accounts. There was no effect on the Statements of Stockholders  Deficiency, Operations or Cash Flows.     The following tables show the principal financial statement line items originally reported and restatement adjustments as of December 31, 2015:            The above accounts receivable is reported, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $600,000.        Revenue Recognition      In recognition of the principles expressed in Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned, and given the element of doubt associated with collectability of an agreed settlement on past due debt, the Company postpones recognition of all contingent revenue until the client receives payment from the debtor. As is required by SAB 104, revenues are considered to have been earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the successful collection of past due debts using the Company's system and/or, for clients under a flat fee arrangement, the successful availability of the Company's system to its customers.      Revenues for the preparation of student loan documentation are earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the completed, delivered and accepted student loan package by the Department of Education and subsequent yearly re-certifications to DoE. The Company may sell its products separately or in various bundles that include multiple elements such as initial fees, monitoring, re-certification, and other services.     The Company also earns revenue from collection agencies, healthcare providers and lenders that implemented our online system. The Company's current contracts provide for revenue based on a percentage of the amount of debt collected, a fee per settlement or through a flat monthly fee. Although other revenue models have been proposed, most revenue earned to date has been determined using these methods, and such revenue is recognized when the settlement amount of debt is collected by the client or at the beginning of the month for a flat fee. While the percent of debt collected will continue to be a revenue recognition method going forward, other payment models are also being offered to clients. Dependent upon the structure of future contracts, revenue may be derived from a combination of set up fees or flat monthly or annual fees with transaction fees upon debt settlement, fees per account loaded or fees per settlement.                  8       
     Table of Contents          DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016      Payment Resolution Systems, the Company's 51% owned subsidiary, works as an extended business office to medical groups around the U.S. Revenue is earned in this business by the online negotiations and collection of group's accounts receivable and paid via a service fee.     Revenues for set-up fees, percentage contingent collection fees, fixed settlement fees, monthly fees, etc. are accounted for as Multiple-Element Arrangements under ASC 605-10 which incorporates Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements ("ASC 605-25"). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.     The Company defers any revenue for which the product or service has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred revenues of $1,131,221 and $1,260,137, respectively      Estimates      The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and certain disclosures. The most significant estimates are those used in determination of the carrying value of accounts receivable, revenue recognition, derivative liabilities and stock compensation. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.      Concentrations and Credit Risk      The Company extends credit to large, mid-size and small companies for the use of its software solutions along with customers in the student loan industry. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have an accounts receivable concentration and no sales concentrations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Net Loss per Common Share, basic and diluted      The Company computes earnings (loss) per share under Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ("ASC 260-10"). Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the "treasury stock" and/or "if converted" methods as applicable.     The computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share as of September 30, 2016 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period.      Potentially dilutive securities as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:                       9       
     Table of Contents          DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016        Reclassification      Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period's data to conform to the current period's presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income or losses.      Stock-based compensation      The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by the Company in the same expense classifications in the statements of operations, as if such amounts were paid in cash. As of September 30, 2016, there were outstanding stock options to purchase 18,742,434 shares of common stock, 13,592,434 shares of which were vested.       Defined Contribution (401k) Plan      The Company maintains a defined contribution (401k) plan for our employees. The plan provides for a company match in the amount of 100% of the first 3% of pre-tax salary contributed and 50% of the next 3% of pre-tax salary contributed. Due to the severe cash limitations that the Company has experienced, the match was suspended from mid-2008 to the present and will only be re-instated when business conditions warrant.      Derivative Liability      The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges. See Note 10 for discussion of the Company's derivative liabilities.      Recent accounting pronouncements      There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       NOTE 3   LIQUIDITY      The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,587,953 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company has negative working capital (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) of $11,267,418 as of September 30, 2016. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.            DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016       The Company has undertaken further steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and beyond to address its lack of liquidity by raising additional funds, either in the form of debt or equity or some combination thereof. However, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and or business plans, and it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations and be able to obtain additional financing.     The Company's continued existence is dependent upon management's ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems. There can be no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. In the event that the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, it may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy.     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.      NOTE 4   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DUE TO FACTOR      Accounts receivable are receivables generated from sales to customers and progress billings on performance type contracts. Amounts included in accounts receivable are deemed to be collectible within the Company's operating cycle. Management provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company's historical losses, specific customer circumstances, and general economic conditions. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance based on current circumstances and charges off uncollectible receivables when all attempts to collect have been exhausted and the prospects for recovery are remote. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's accounts receivable was $4,444,177 and $3,463,161, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,086,473 and $600,000, respectively.     The Company's majority owned subsidiaries, Progress Advocates LLC and Student Loan Care, LLC entered into a factoring agreements which had certain provisions that factor advances were based on either a non-recourse and recourse basis. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company agreed to modify the terms of the outstanding factoring agreement whereby the outstanding advances which were originally based upon a non-recourse basis will be reclassified to a full recourse advances. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the outstanding advances of $1,128,701 to a full recourse liability to the factor, increased the carrying value of accounts receivable by $1,128,701, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $212,388.     The recourse agreements provide for the Company to receive an advance of between 30% - 96% of any accounts receivable that it factors with 62% - 0% held in reserve. The average amount received from these recourse agreements was 50.9% and the average amount reserved was 42.1%. The factoring agreements also provide for discount fees of 4% - 8% of the face value of any accounts receivable factored, plus additional charges for other transaction fees. The agreements may be terminated by either party at any time and will continue unless either party formally cancels.      The Company's majority owned subsidiary, Student Loan Care LLC, entered into a similar recourse factoring agreement during the second quarter of 2016. This agreement provides for the Company to receive an advance of between 45% - 90% of any accounts receivable that it factors with 45% - 5% held in reserve. The average amount received was 64% and the average amount reserved was 30%. The factoring agreement also provides for discount fees of 3% - 6% of the face value of any accounts receivable factored, plus additional charges for other transaction fees. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time and will continue unless either party formally cancels. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's outstanding obligation under the factoring agreements were $3,666,931 and $2,442,935, respectively.             DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016       NOTE 5   ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES      Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are comprised of the following:           On April 19, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the former Chief Executive officer whereby the Company issued a convertible note for $75,000 and 2,225,000 warrants to purchase the Company's common stock at $0.10 per share for three years as part settlement of the outstanding salary due of $153,750. The remaining balance is to be paid monthly installments of $2,500 to the extent of available cash flows as determined by the Board of Directors.

At inception of the May 15, 2016 note, the Company determined the aggregate fair value of $73,697 of embedded derivatives. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%; (2) expected volatility of 336.12%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.55%, (4) expected life from 2 years, and (5) estimated fair value of the Company's common stock of $0.02 per share.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION   ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Overview       Business Growth Strategy Update      During the quarter ending September 30, 2016, significant progress was made in the implementation of our new strategies. While individual setbacks were expected and did occur, each was addressed and positive momentum resumed for the respective strategy. The following is a brief review of the important progress achieved in each strategy:                       Student Loan Care LLC was launched in June 2016 and established itself as a financially viable company in the quarter ending September 30, 2016.  This new joint venture is a partnership with Hutton Ventures LLC., a California based company with extensive experience in the federal student loan document preparation industry. The business model for Student Loan Care, specifically addresses the issues of high marketing costs and customer churn, two significant issues realized by the Company s majority owned joint venture, Progress Advocates LLC. From its first month of operation in June 2016, Revenue grew every month from $104,818 in June, to $466,349 in September. Over the same period, operating income turned positive and grew every month from ($170,305) June to $122,678 in September. Gross margins were positive in every month of the quarter, growing sequentially to 26.3% of sales. These margins were over 10% higher than the best monthly margin achieved by Progress Advocates in 2015. These margin improvements are a direct result of Student Loan Care s new marketing model that reduced the cost of customer acquisition by 40% as compared to the customer acquisition cost at Progress Advocates.                        Progress Advocates continues to support its current customers as it evaluates other business options.  As previously reported in both the Company's 2015 form 10-K and form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31,2016, the Company suspended all marketing and sales activities during the first quarter of 2016. After continued discussions with our joint venture partner who was also the operator of Progress Advocates, the Company reached the conclusion that the changes necessary to reach profitability were not going to be made by our partner. By the beginning of 2016, it was evident that high marketing and sales costs, along with a higher than expected default of customer payments, resulted in a business cost structure that was unsupported by current revenues. Progress Advocates will continue to support its current customers and provide to them all contracted services. In September, Progress Advocates initiated discussions to explore the sale of its loan portfolio. Initial response has been positive. However, no offers have been made to indicate the relative market value of this asset.                            Enhance the Debt Resolve Solution by integrating it with other services to become a total solution for the medical ARM market.  Our majority owned joint venture, Payment Resolution Systems offers a service to Medical Practices and Hospitals looking to give patients with unpaid accounts one last chance to pay. The one last chance will be a negotiated settlement offering using Debt Resolve's patented double blind bidding technology. A pilot of this business was run in March and April of 2016 with a NYC Anesthesiology practice. The results were better than expected and a second pilot was run for an Atlanta GA Anesthesiology Group. This effort confirmed our initial results and demonstrated our ability to negotiate settlements for high and low account balances. A national sales effort has been initiated with significant interest by healthcare providers, however, the sales cycle has been longer than anticipated due to push back from the prospective client s current ARM vendors.                            Leverage our technology and knowledge of consumer debt collection to launch a new internet based product in the consumer to consumer debt resolution and collection space.  As resources were diverted to support the launch and development of Student loan Care LLC (see above). The development effort on Settl.it/Pro was postponed to the fourth quarter of 2016. A soft launch of this small business product is scheduled for January 2017. Pending market response, national availability is anticipated in March 2017.                                   Leverage our public equity financial structure by purchasing equity interests in private companies that will benefit from the experience and skills of our management and consultants as well as from holding our publicly traded equity.  During the second quarter of 2016, , Student Loan Care LLC was formed with Hutton Ventures LLC to offer document preparation services for Federal student loan holders wanting to apply for various U.S. Department of Education Student loan payment modification programs. The principles of Hutton Ventures are experienced in the federal student loan document preparation industry and in the use of advanced communications techniques to increase productivity and profitability in a traditional people based business environment. To reward their successful participation in Student Loan Care, goals for Student Loan Care revenue growth and net profit attainment have been established. Hutton Venture partners will be granted warrants for Debt Resolve common stock upon the attainment of each of these goals.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenues       Revenues totaled $1,336,870 and $2,242,686 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We earned revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as a percent of debt collected, on a fee per settlement and on a flat monthly fee basis. In addition, we earn revenue from fees for providing student loan document preparation services. The decreased revenue mainly resulted from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC of $170,201 for the three month ending September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,213,059 for the same period last year. To offset this revenue loss, our majority owned subsidiary, Student Loan Care LLC started offering services in June, 2016 and had revenues of $1,154,074 in the three months ending September 30, 2016.        Costs and Expenses        Payroll and related expenses.  Payroll and related expenses amounted to $598,941 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $640,334 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $41,393. Stock based compensation was $90,121 and $107,051 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       Selling and marketing expenses.  Selling and marketing expenses decreased from $636,280 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $262,562 for the same period in 2016. The significant decrease is due to the reduced sales and marketing activities of Progress Advocates LLC., our majority owned subsidiary.       General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses amounted to $483,783 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $445,399 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $38,384. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the most significant expense increase was the addition of Student Loan Care, LLC in 2016, net with the reduction in Progressive Advocates LLC activity.      Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  In 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes with certain embedded derivatives, as such, any issued convertible instruments issued subsequent require us to fair value the conversion feature as derivatives each reporting period and mark to market as a non-cash adjustment to our current period operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $122,901 loss on change in fair value of our derivative liabilities. On August 17, 2016, eliminated the embedded derivatives through note amendments.      During the three months September 30, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to reclassify the derivative from equity to a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a loss on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $1,238,479.            Interest (expense).  We recorded interest expense of $296,582 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to interest expense of $485,198 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense decreased primarily from our reduced financing of accounts receivable with Progressive Advocates.      Amortization of deferred debt discount.  Amortization expense of $69,545 and $24,089 was incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the amortization of the value of the deferred debt discount associated with certain of our notes payable. Amortization expense increased due to new notes added in 2015 and 2016.      Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenues       Revenues totaled $2,342,344 and $4,152,453 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We earned revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as a percent of debt collected, on a fee per settlement and on a flat monthly fee basis. In addition, we earn revenue from fees for providing student loan document preparation services. The decreased revenue mainly resulted from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC of $1,009,434 for the nine month ending September 30, 2016 as compared to $4,066,123 for the same period last year. As noted above, this reduction in revenue was a result of suspending the new sales operations of Progress Advocates in February, 2016. To offset this revenue loss, our majority owned subsidiary, Student Loan Care LLC started offering services in June, 2016 and had revenues of $1,258,892 in the nine months ending September 30, 2016.       Costs and Expenses        Payroll and related expenses.  Payroll and related expenses amounted to $1,214,507 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,462,792 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $248,285. Stock based compensation was $244,200 and $125,257 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease mainly resulted from our staffing reductions from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC from $1,113,896 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $192,881 for the same period, current year, offset with an increase in Student Loan Care LLC of $594,984 in the current period.       Selling and marketing expenses.  Selling and marketing expenses decreased from $1,562,880 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $387,062 for the same period in 2016. The significant decrease is due to the reduced sales and marketing activities of Progress Advocates LLC., our majority owned subsidiary.       General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses amounted to $1,683,916 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $945,161 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $738,755. Of the increase, $243,531 was incurred from our subsidiary, Student Loan Care, LLC, in the current year, as compared to $-0- for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the most significant expense incurred by Progress Advocates was an increased provision for Accounts Receivables bad debt reserves of $432,506.             Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  In 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes with certain embedded derivatives, as such, any issued convertible instruments issued subsequent require us to fair value the conversion feature as derivatives each reporting period and mark to market as a non-cash adjustment to our current period operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $30,317 gain on change in fair value of our derivative liabilities. On August 17, 2016, eliminated the embedded derivatives through note amendments.  During the nine months September 30, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to reclassify the derivative from equity to a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a loss on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $897,648.      Interest (expense).  We recorded interest expense of $745,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to interest expense of $1,133,999 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense decreased primarily due to our factoring arrangement we have with our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates. In the current period, we incurred $124,515 as compared to $774,848 in 2015.       Amortization of deferred debt discount.  Amortization expense of $152,555 and $66,065 was incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the amortization of the value of the deferred debt discount associated with certain of our notes payable. Amortization expense increased due to new notes added in 2015 and 2016.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) in the amount of $11,267,418 and cash and cash equivalents totaling $135,050. We reported a net loss of $1,587,953 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $587,186 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash flow provided by in financing activities was $691,756 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficiency (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) in the amount of $10,313,663 and cash and cash equivalents totaling $30,480.     Our working capital as of the date of this report is negative and is not sufficient to fund our plan of operations for the next year. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     We have successfully raised capital for our day-to-day operations since our inception; however, no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds secured will be sufficient to enable us to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that we are unsuccessful, we may need to curtail our operations and implement a plan to extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. At any time until substantial capital is raised or we reach cash flow breakeven, there is also a significant risk of bankruptcy. There can be no assurance that any plan to raise additional funding will be successful. It is quite challenging in the current environment to raise money given our delay in generating meaningful revenue. Unless our revenue grows quickly, it may not be possible to demonstrate the progress investors require to secure additional funding. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.            Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on our management's judgment and available information and, consequently, actual results could be different from these estimates. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are as follows:      Revenue Recognition      We earn revenue from collection agencies, collection law firms and lenders that implemented our online system. Our current contracts provide for revenue based on a percentage of the amount of debt collected, a fee per settlement or through a flat monthly fee. Although other revenue models have been proposed, most revenue earned to date has been determined using these methods, and such revenue is recognized when the settlement amount of debt is collected by the client or at the beginning of the month for a flat fee. For the early adopters of our product, we have waived set-up fees and other transactional fees that we anticipate charging in the future. While the percent of debt collected will continue to be a revenue recognition method going forward, other payment models are also being offered to clients and may possibly become our preferred revenue model. Dependent upon the structure of future contracts, revenue may be derived from a combination of set up fees or flat monthly or annual fees with transaction fees upon debt settlement, fees per account loaded or fees per settlement. We are currently marketing our system to three primary markets. The first and second are financial institutions and collection agencies or law firms, our traditional markets. We are also expanding into healthcare, particularly hospitals, which is our third market.     Revenues for the preparation of student loan documentation are earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the completion and delivery of the student loan modification and consolidation documentation package on behalf of the client to the U.S. Department of Education. The Company may sell its products separately or in various bundles that include multiple elements such as initial fees, monitoring, annual renewals and other services.     We defer any revenue for which the product or service has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.       Accounts Receivable      Accounts receivable are receivables generated from sales to customers and progress billings on performance type contracts. Amounts included in accounts receivable are deemed to be collectible within the Company's operating cycle. Management provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company's historical losses, specific customer circumstances, and general economic conditions. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance based on current circumstances and charges off uncollectible receivables when all attempts to collect have been exhausted and the prospects for recovery are remote.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's accounts receivable was $4,444,177 and $3,463,161, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,086,473 and $600,000, respectively.     The Company's majority owned subsidiaries, Progress Advocates LLC and Student Loan Care LLC entered into a factoring agreements which had certain provisions that factor advances were based on either a non-recourse and recourse basis. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company agreed to modify the terms of the existing factoring agreement whereby the outstanding advances which were originally based upon a non-recourse basis will be reclassified to a full recourse advances. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the outstanding advances of $1,128,701 to a full recourse liability to the factor, increased the carrying value of accounts receivable by $1,128,701, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $212,388.             Stock-based compensation      We follow Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10, Stock-based Compensation ("ASC 718-10"). The standards require the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee's requisite service period.      Fair Values      Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10") requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.     We follow Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10") and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. None of these statements had an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.      Derivative Liability      We account for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.      Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements      See recently adopted and issued accounting standards in "Note 2 Significant accounting policies" in Item 1. Financial statements of this report.      Statement Relating to Forward-Looking Statements      This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions and information currently available to us. When used in this report, the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "potential" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties concerning our recent research and development activities; the risks and uncertainties concerning acceptance of our services and products, if and when fully developed, by our potential customers; our present financial condition and the risks and uncertainties concerning the availability of additional capital as and when required; the risks and uncertainties concerning the Limited License Agreement with Messrs. Brofman and Burchetta; the risks and uncertainties concerning our dependence on our key executives; the risks and uncertainties concerning technological changes and the competition for our services and products; the risks and uncertainties concerning general economic conditions; and the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on April 14, 2016, in the section labeled "Risk Factors."

We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, all of which speak only as of the date of this report.             ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not applicable.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that we disclose required information in a timely manner and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Our Chief Executive Officer has participated in such evaluation. Management concluded, based on such review, that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The ineffectiveness of these disclosure controls is due to the matters described below in "Internal Control over Financial Reporting."      Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls      We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that such controls and procedures are not effective at the "reasonable assurance" level. The ineffectiveness of these disclosure controls is due to the matters described below in "Internal Control over Financial Reporting."      Internal Control over Financial Reporting      Segregation of duties within our Company is limited due to the small number of employees that are assigned to positions that involve the processing of financial information. Specifically, certain key financial accounting and reporting personnel had an expansive scope of duties that allowed for the creation, review, approval and processing of financial data without independent review and authorization for preparation of consolidation schedules and resulting financial statements and related disclosures. We did not maintain a sufficient depth of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the selection and application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles commensurate with financial reporting requirements.      Accordingly, we place undue reliance on the finance team at corporate headquarters, specifically the executive who is our Chief Executive Officer and outside accounting professionals.      Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This material weakness could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, due to limited staffing, we are not always able to detect minor errors or omissions in reporting.     Going forward, management anticipates that additional staff will be necessary to mitigate these weaknesses, as well as to implement other planned improvements. Additional staff will enable us to document and apply transactional and periodic controls procedures, permit a better review and approval process and improve quality of financial reporting. However, the potential addition of new staff is contingent on obtaining additional financing, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.     Management believes that its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are fairly presented, in all material respects, its financial condition and results of operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II     OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS        Lawsuits from Noteholders      On July 20, 2015, the Company received a complaint concerning a promissory note dated December 21, 2007 that matured on June 21, 2009. See, Commitments and Contingencies Note 13 (Litigation).       Lawsuits from vendors      From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. There are currently no lawsuits from vendors.      New York State Attorney General Subpoena      In December 2015, the Company and Progress Advocates, its majority owned subsidiary, received a subpoena requesting documents regarding the operations of Progress Advocates. It is our understanding that this request was one of several requests sent to companies operating in the Federal Student Loan document preparation space in New York State. We have provided the requested information that was available, both from Progress Advocates and its vendors. Additional information has been provided subsequent to the Company's initial response. We are confident that our compliance with payments aligned to the consumer's receipt of benefit and our vendor's responsible marketing will be accurately demonstrated in the information provided.        ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       As a "small reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item.       ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       None.       ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES       Investor Note 1:     On December 21, 2007, an unaffiliated investor loaned us $125,000 on an unsecured 18-month note with a maturity date of June 21, 2009. The note has a provision requiring repayment once we raised an aggregate of $500,000 following issuance of this note. As a result, this note is currently in default as it has not been repaid and we reached the $500,000 threshold in September, 2008. The note carries interest at a rate of 12% per annum, with interest accruing and payable at maturity. In conjunction with the note, we granted to the investor a warrant to purchase 37,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.07 and an expiration date of December 21, 2012. This note is guaranteed by, a shareholder and former Company director. On April 10, 2008, we borrowed an additional $198,000 from this investor. Please see discussion below.     On April 10, 2008, an unaffiliated investor loaned us an additional $198,000 on an amendment of the prior unsecured note with a maturity date of June 21, 2009 for the entire balance of the first note plus the amendment ($323,000 total). The note carries interest at a rate of 12% per annum, with interest accruing and payable at maturity. The outstanding principal and interest may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without prepayment penalty. In conjunction with the note, we also issued a warrant to purchase 99,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.45 and an expiration date of April 10, 2013. This warrant has a "cashless" exercise feature. This note is guaranteed by a Director of the Company. The amended note maintains the provision requiring repayment of the note upon raising gross proceeds of $500,000 subsequent the issuance of the note.            At September 30, 2008, we had raised in excess of $500,000 subsequent to this amended note, and as a result, this note is in default. We also issued 50,000 shares of common stock valued at $122,130 in order to induce the investor to forbear on the note, which was included in expenses.      On February 12, 2010, we converted $74,867 of accrued interest through January 2010 and $65,133 of principal on the note to stock.     On August 27, 2010, the investor was paid $80,000 in principal through partial sale of the note, leaving a remaining balance of $177,867 plus accrued interest due on the note as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, this note has matured and is still outstanding and is in default at this time.
