ZEV VENTURES, INC  

  NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Zev Ventures Inc. (the  Company ) is a Nevada Corporation,
incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 22, 2014. The Company's business plan involves purchasing tickets
online for popular sport's events and reselling them through online marketplaces. 

Basis of Presentation  

The Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). 

These financial statements are presented in US dollars. 

Fiscal Year End  

The Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The interim financial statements of the
Company as of September 30, 2016, and for the period then ended, are unaudited. However, in the opinion of management, the interim
financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for three and
nine month period ended September 30, 2016. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the calendar
year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying financial statements and notes thereto do not reflect all disclosures required
under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Refer to the Company s audited financial statements
as of December 31, 2016, for additional information, including significant accounting policies. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The principal accounting policies are
set out below, these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented, unless otherwise stated:  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Going concern  

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities
in the normal course of business. As at September 30, 2016 the Company has a deficit from operations of $39,677 and has not earned
sufficient revenues to cover operating costs and has a working capital deficit of $39,377. The Company intends to fund operations
through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash
requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage
is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan.
In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. 

These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Cash and cash equivalents  

Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities
of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. 

F- 4  

Inventory  

The Company purchases online tickets to
sporting events that are held as inventory. Inventories are presented at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are expensed
through cost of sales when sold. The company plans to utilize the specific identification method of accounting for inventory since
each ticket is identifiable by a unique ticket number and is easy to track from purchase up to sale. As at September 30, 2016 the
Company has $7,205 in inventories. 

Property, plant and equipment  

The Company does not own any property, plant and equipment. 

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses  

Accounts payable and accrued expenses are
carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial
year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods
and services. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue when all
of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer exists, delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the selling price is reasonably assured. 

The Company recognizes revenue when the
online sale has been processed as delivery has occurred, the selling price has been determined and proceeds have been collected. 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers. 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic
740,  Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred
tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Earnings per Share  

The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC
260,  Earnings Per Share  ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS )
on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders
of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting
the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects
of all potential dilutive common shares, which comprise options granted to employees. As September 30, 2016, the Company had no
potentially dilutive shares. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based
on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that
would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on
either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. 

The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure
fair value: 

 - Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments; 

 - Level 2: Other significant observable inputs (including quoted
prices in active markets for similar instruments); 

 - Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs (including assumptions
in determining the fair value of certain investments). 

F- 5  

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued ASU No. 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  guidance which requires inventory within the scope
of the standard to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Previous guidance required inventory to be measured
at the lower of cost or market (where market was defined as replacement cost, with a ceiling of net realizable value and floor
of net realizable value less a normal profit margin). The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. There were various other updates recently issued, none of which
are expected to a have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 3   LOAN FROM RELATED PARTY  

NOTE 4   STOCKHOLDER S DEFICIT  

Common Stock  

On December 22, 2014, the Company issued
3,000,000 shares of common stock to the director of the Company at a price of $0.0001 per share, for $300 cash. 

NOTE 5   INCOME TAXES  

The benefit for income taxes for the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 differ from the amount which would be expected as a result of applying the statutory
tax rates to the losses before income taxes due primarily to changes in the valuation allowance to fully reserve net deferred tax
assets. 

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to
be available to reduce taxable income. 

F- 6  

The components of these differences are
as follows: 

The Company has provided a valuation allowance
against the full amount of the deferred tax asset due to management s uncertainty about its realization. As of September
30, 2016 the Company had approximately $39,677 in tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized future periods to reduce taxable
income, and expire by the year 2036. 

NOTE 6   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Details of transactions between the Corporation
and related parties are disclosed below. 

The following entities have been identified
as related parties:  

Zev Turetsky 
     Director and greater than
10% stockholder  

The following transactions were carried
out with related parties:  

From time to time, the president and stockholder of the Company
provides advances to the Company for its working capital purposes. These advances bear no interest and are due on demand. 

NOTE 7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In accordance with ASC 855-10, Company
management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and determined that there are no additional material subsequent
events to report.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management s Discussion and
Analysis includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like:  believe,   expect,   estimate, 
 anticipate,   intend,   project,   will,   should  and similar expressions,
or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements,
which apply only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. We undertake no obligation to
update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.  

Our financial statements are stated in
United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 

In this quarterly report, unless otherwise
specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to  common stock  refer to the
common shares in our capital stock. 

As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms
 we,   us,   Company,   our  and  Spirit  mean Zev Ventures, Inc.,
unless otherwise indicated. 

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT
OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AS A GOING CONCERN. 

Results of Operations   

Our results of operations are presented
below: 

Results of Operations for the Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016.   

Revenue for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $2,094 and $3,694. 

Total Operating expenses for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,689 and $15,155. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016 we had $6,447
in cash and $13,652 in total assets, and $53,029 in total liabilities as compared to $5,174 in cash, and $8,040 in total assets,
and $28,303 in total liabilities as of December 31, 2015. 

We are dependent on our revenues for cash
flow, as we have minimized cash flow requirements through equity or debt financing.  However, as we intend to expand
operations, it is likely that we will require cash flow from financing in the future which could affect our ability to become cash
flow positive. 

For the nine months ending September
30, 2016 net cash of $(22,927) was provided by operating activities, compared to net cash of $(15,775) provided by operating activities
for the nine months ending September 30, 2015. 

During the nine months ending September
30, 2016, net cash of $24,200 was provided by financing activities compared to net cash of $19,164 for the nine months ending September
30, 2015. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no significant off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Inflation   

The amounts presented in the financial
statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would
be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement
costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e), our management
has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of Zev Turetsky our President and Principal Accounting
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2016.
Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, Zev Turetsky determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

During the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
