The Receiving Party shall use the Disclosing Party s Confidential Information solely for the purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not disclose or disseminate any such Confidential Information to any Person at any time, except for disclosure to those of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, accountants, attorneys, advisers and agents that have a need to know such information to permit the Receiving Party to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Agreement,  provided that  such Persons are bound to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information to the same extent as if they were parties hereto.

The Indemnifying Party shall assume and diligently pursue the defense of such claim, at its cost, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.  The Indemnifying Party shall have absolute control of the conduct of the litigation;  provided ,  however ,  that   
     
  12.4.1.     the Indemnified Party may, nevertheless, participate therein through counsel of its choice and at its cost, and shall be permitted to effectively associate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense, the prosecution and the negotiation of any settlement of the claim or demand;

 66   

Indemnifying Party shall consider in good faith any input provided by the Indemnified Party with respect to the Pleadings; and  
     
  12.4.4.     if the suit includes a defense of Momenta IP or the Joint Collaboration IP or an Invalidity Claim with respect to Momenta IP or the Joint Collaboration IP (in the event Momenta is the Indemnified Party), then the Indemnifying Party s conduct of the litigation with respect to such claim(s) shall be subject to:  
     
  12.4.4.a.      the approval of Momenta (solely in relation to Momenta IP or Joint Collaboration IP); and/or  
     
  12.4.4.b.     any contractual obligations as of the Effective Date (or thereafter if otherwise agreed by the Parties) to, or restrictions existing as of the Effective Date (or thereafter if otherwise agreed by the Parties) imposed by, the relevant Third Party Licensor or the Existing US Lovenox Agreement.  
     
  The Party not assuming the defense of any such claim or demand shall render all reasonable assistance to the Party assuming such defense as requested by such defending Party, and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such assistance shall be for the account of the Indemnifying Party.  No such claim or demand shall be settled other than by the Party defending the same, and then only with the consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;  provided that  the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to consent to any settlement of any such claim which imposes on the Indemnified Party any liability or obligation which cannot be assumed and performed in full by the Indemnifying Party or which agrees that any element of any of Momenta IP or Joint Collaboration IP (in the event Momenta is the Indemnified Party) is invalid, not infringed or unenforceable.  The Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.  
     
  12.5.         Sharing of Legal Expenses .  
     
  12.5.1.

  12.5.2.     Under no circumstances shall the Profit Interest payable to Momenta, as a result of this Section 12.5, in any Quarter be reduced to less than [**] percent ([**]%) of the Profit Interest amount otherwise payable to Momenta in such Quarter under this Agreement.  Sandoz may offset any portion of the Legal Expenses not deductible from

the Profit Interest payable to Momenta as a result of such limitation against future Profit Interests due to Momenta with respect to such Product (or the other Collaboration Product, to the extent such offset is permitted by the proviso in Section 12.5.1).  
     
  12.6.         Insurance .  Sandoz shall be self-insured.

Momenta shall comply with the insurance obligations imposed on Momenta pursuant to the MIT Agreement.

All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence.  If such Executive Officers cannot resolve such dispute within [**] days after their initial meeting pursuant to this Section 13.2, then each Party reserves its right to pursue any and all remedies available under law or equity with respect to such dispute.  
     
  13.3.         Legal Remedies .

Each Party agrees that, notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that this Agreement is assigned by either Party as provided in the foregoing clause (c) or a transaction described in clause (c) occurs with respect to a Party, such assignment or transaction shall not provide the other Party with rights or access to intellectual property rights of the acquirer of such Party which were not already Patent Rights or Know-How Controlled by such Party prior to such assignment or transaction.

SCHEDULE 1.89    NET SALES   
     
  Net Sales Concepts  
     
  The Novartis Group s principal accounting policies are set out in note 1 of the Group s consolidated financial statements and conform to International Financial Reporting Standards (  IFRS  ).  Significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which, to the extent that actual outcomes and results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, could affect the accounting in the areas described in this section.  
     
   REVENUE   
     
  Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss for the products are transferred to the customer. Provisions for rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, managed care and other customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment. They are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of invoicing. Wholesaler shelf-inventory adjustments are granted to customers based on the existing inventory of a product at the time of decreases in the invoice or contract price of a product or at the point of sale if a price decline is reasonably estimable.  Where there is a historical experience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns, Novartis records a provision for estimated sales returns by applying historical experience of customer returns to the amounts invoiced and the amount of returned products to be destroyed versus products that can be placed back in inventory for resale.  
     
    Optional    
     
  DEDUCTIONS FROM REVENUES: As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Novartis  gross sales are subject to various deductions, primarily comprised of rebates and discounts to retail customers, government agencies, wholesalers and managed health care organizations. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
