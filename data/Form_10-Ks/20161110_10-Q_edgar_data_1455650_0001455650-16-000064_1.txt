           1. 
    Business and Organization 
     NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed to originate, acquire and asset manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate ( CRE ) debt, select equity and securities investments, predominantly in the United States.  The Company may also invest in CRE investments internationally.  CRE debt investments include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests.  Real estate equity investments include the Company s direct ownership in properties, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner s equity, as well as indirect interests in real estate through real estate private equity funds ( PE Investments ).  CRE securities primarily consist of commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and may include unsecured real estate investment trust ( REIT ) debt, collateralized debt obligation ( CDO ) notes and other securities.  In addition, the Company may own investments through joint ventures.  The Company was formed in January 2009 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in October 2010.  The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ), commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.  The Company conducts its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
  The Company is externally managed and has   no   employees.  Prior to June 30, 2014, the Company was managed by an affiliate of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) ( NorthStar Realty ).  Effective June 30, 2014, NorthStar Realty spun-off its asset management business into a separate publicly traded company, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM) (the  Sponsor ).  The Sponsor and its affiliates provide asset management and other services to the Company, NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. (NYSE: NRE), other sponsored public retail-focused companies and any other companies the Sponsor and its affiliates may manage in the future (collectively, the  NSAM Managed Companies ), both in the United States and internationally.  Concurrent with the spin-off, affiliates of the Sponsor entered into a new advisory agreement with the Company and each of the other NSAM Managed Companies.  Pursuant to the Company s advisory agreement, NSAM J-NSI Ltd, an affiliate of the Sponsor (the  Advisor ), agreed to manage the day-to-day operations of the Company on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the Company s prior advisory agreement with NS Real Estate Income Trust Advisor, LLC (the  Prior Advisor ).  References to the  Prior Advisor  herein refer to the services performed by and fees paid and accrued to the Prior Advisor during the period prior to June 30, 2014.  The spin-off of NorthStar Realty s asset management business had no impact on the Company s operations.   
  In June 2016, the Sponsor announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. ( Colony ), providing for the combination of the Sponsor, NorthStar Realty and Colony into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sponsor, as the surviving publicly-traded company for the combined organization that, upon and following the effective time of the mergers, will be named Colony NorthStar, Inc. ( Colony NorthStar ).  As a result of the mergers, Colony NorthStar will be an internally-managed equity REIT, with a diversified real estate and investment management platform.  In addition, following the mergers, the Advisor will be a subsidiary of Colony NorthStar.  This transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by the Sponsor s, NorthStar Realty s and Colony s respective shareholders.  There is no guarantee this transaction will close on the contemplated terms or within the anticipated timeframe, or at all.  The Company does not expect that this transaction will have a material impact on its operations. 
  Substantially all the Company s business is conducted through NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust Operating Partnership, LP (the  Operating Partnership ).  The Company is the sole general partner and a limited partner of the Operating Partnership.  The other limited partners of the Operating Partnership are the Prior Advisor and NorthStar OP Holdings, LLC (the  Special Unit Holder ), each an affiliate of the Sponsor.  The Prior Advisor invested   $1,000   in the Operating Partnership in exchange for common units and the Special Unit Holder invested   $1,000   in the Operating Partnership and was issued a separate class of limited partnership units (the  Special Units ), which are collectively recorded as non-controlling interests on the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  As the Company accepted subscriptions for shares in its continuous, public offering which closed in July 2013, it contributed substantially all of the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership as a capital contribution.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership was   99.98%  .   
  The Company s charter authorizes the issuance of up to   400,000,000   shares of common stock with a par value of   $0.01   per share and up to   50,000,000   shares of preferred stock with a par value of   $0.01   per share.  The board of directors of the Company is authorized to amend its charter, without the approval of the stockholders, to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of capital stock or the number of shares of any class or series that the Company has authority to issue.   
  The Company initially registered to offer up to   100,000,000   shares pursuant to its primary offering to the public (the  Primary Offering ) and up to   10,526,315   shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the  DRP ), which are herein collectively

referred to as the Offering.  In April 2013, the board of directors of the Company authorized the reallocation of shares available under the DRP to the Primary Offering.  The Primary Offering (including   7.6 million   shares reallocated from the DRP, the  Total Primary Offering ) was completed on July 1, 2013 and all of the shares initially registered for the Offering were issued.  As a result of an additional registration statement to offer up to   10.0 million   shares pursuant to the DRP, the Company continues to offer DRP shares beyond the Total Primary Offering. 
  The Company raised total gross proceeds of   $1.1 billion   in the Offering.  In addition, from the close of the Primary Offering through   November 4, 2016  , the Company has raised an additional   $0.2 billion   in gross proceeds pursuant to the DRP. 
   
           2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Quarterly Presentation  
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.  The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 17, 2016. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities ( VIEs ), if any, where the Company is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by the Company.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.   
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  The Company bases its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.  The Company reassesses its initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.   
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Company or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of the Company and the other interests.  The Company reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.   
  The Company evaluates its investments and financings, including investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions, if any, to determine whether each investment or financing is a VIE.  The Company analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company adopted the new consolidation guidance (refer to Recent Accounting Pronouncements) on January 1, 2016, which resulted in the identification of several VIEs.  Prior to the adoption of the standard, these entities were consolidated under the voting interest model.  The most significant consolidated VIEs are the Operating Partnership and certain properties that have non-controlling interests.  These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights.  The Company consolidates these entities because it controls all significant business activities. 
  The Operating Partnership consolidates certain properties that have non-controlling interests.  Included in operating real estate, net on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   is   $356.7 million   related to such consolidated VIEs.  Included in mortgage notes payable, net on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   is   $316.2 million   collateralized by the real estate assets of the related consolidated VIEs. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company identified unconsolidated VIEs related to its securities investments, PE investments and CRE debt investments.  Assets of each of the VIEs may only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIE.  Creditors of each of the VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the Company. 
  The following table presents the Company s classification, carrying value and maximum exposure of unconsolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

_________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Includes loan collateral receivable, related party of $  52.7 million   .   
     Based on management s analysis, the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs.  Accordingly, the VIEs are not consolidated in the Company s financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company did not provide financial support to the unconsolidated VIEs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   explicit arrangements or implicit variable interests that could require the Company to provide financial support to the unconsolidated VIEs outside of the future funding commitments disclosed above. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If the Company has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  The Company does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or a simple majority vote. 
  The Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.   
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  A non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.   
  Under the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity s net income (loss).  Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents.  An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of preferred returns and allocation formulas, if any, as described in such governing documents.  Equity method investments are recognized using a cost accumulation model in which the investment is recognized based on the cost to the investor, which includes acquisition fees.  The Company records as an expense certain acquisition costs and fees

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

associated with consolidated investments deemed to be business combinations and capitalizes these costs for investments deemed to be acquisitions of an asset, including an equity method investment. 
  The Company may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option.  The Company elected the fair value option for PE Investments.  The Company records the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).   
  The Company may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if the Company determines the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant.  Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.   
  Non-controlling Interests 
  A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.  A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to controlling and non-controlling interests.  An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The Company reports consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in separate statements following the consolidated statements of operations.  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI.  The only component of OCI is unrealized gain (loss) on CRE securities available for sale for which the fair value option was not elected. 
  Fair Value Option 
  The fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition.  The Company will generally not elect the fair value option for its assets and liabilities.  However, the Company has elected the fair value option for PE Investments.  Any change in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made is recognized in earnings.   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash, including amounts restricted, may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limit of $250,000 per institution.  The Company mitigates credit risk by placing cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions.  To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents. 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  CRE debt investments are generally intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees, premium and discount.  CRE debt investments that are deemed to be impaired are carried at amortized cost less a loan loss reserve, if deemed appropriate, which approximates fair value.  CRE debt investments where the Company does not have the intent to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until its expected payoff are classified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated value.   
  The Company may syndicate a portion of the CRE debt investments that it originates or sell the CRE debt investments individually.  When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, the Company will no longer recognize the CRE debt investment sold as an asset and will recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the CRE debt

investment sold.  Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in interest income on the consolidated statement of operations.  Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of interest income. 
  Operating Real Estate  
  Operating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life.  The Company accounts for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, improvements and other identified intangibles.  Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations.   
  The Company refers to real estate acquired in connection with a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or a consensual modification of a loan as real estate owned ( REO ).  The Company evaluates whether an REO, herein collectively referred to as taking title to collateral, constitutes a business and whether business combination accounting is appropriate.  Any excess upon taking title to collateral between the carrying value of a loan over the estimated fair value of the property is charged to provision for loan losses. 
  Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, summarized as follows: 
                   Category: 
      
    Term: 
      Building  
      
    30 to 40 years 
      Building improvements 
      
    Lesser of the useful life or remaining life of the building 
      Land improvements 
      
    10 to 30 years 
      Tenant improvements 
      
    Lesser of the useful life or remaining term of the lease 
      Furniture, fixtures and equipment 
      
    3 to 10 years 

Real Estate Securities 
  The Company classifies its CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value.  Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.  
  Deferred Costs 
  Deferred costs primarily include deferred financing costs and deferred lease costs.  Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing.  Costs related to revolving credit facilities are recorded in deferred costs and other asset, net and are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line basis over the term of the facility.  Costs related to other borrowings are recorded net against the carrying value of such borrowings and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.  Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated facility is repaid before maturity.  Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions, which do not close, are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not occur.  Deferred lease costs consist of fees incurred to initiate and renew operating leases, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and are recorded to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Identified Intangibles 
  The Company records acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as the value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below market leases), based on estimated fair value.  The value allocated to the identified intangibles are amortized over the remaining lease term.  Above/below-market leases are amortized into rental income, below-market ground leases are amortized into real estate properties-operating expense and in-place leases are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense.  Identified intangible assets are recorded in deferred costs and other assets, net, and identified intangible liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred Costs and Other Assets, Net and Other Liabilities 
  The following table presents a summary of deferred costs and other assets, net and other liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

_________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents in-place leases and above-market leases, net.  
              (2) 
    Represents below-market leases, net.  
     Acquisition Fees and Expenses 
  The total of all acquisition fees and expenses for an investment, including acquisition fees to the Advisor, cannot exceed, in the aggregate,   6.0%   of the contract purchase price of such investment unless such excess is approved by a majority of the directors, including independent directors.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total acquisition fees and expenses did not exceed the allowed limit for any investment.  An acquisition fee incurred related to an equity investment will generally be expensed as incurred.  An acquisition fee paid to the Advisor related to the acquisition of an equity or debt investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is included in investments in unconsolidated ventures on the consolidated balance sheets.  An acquisition fee paid to the Advisor related to the origination or acquisition of debt investments is included in debt investments, net on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  The Company records as an expense certain acquisition costs and fees associated with transactions deemed to be business combinations in which it consolidates the asset and capitalizes these costs for transactions deemed to be acquisitions of an asset, including an equity investment. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.  The amortization of a premium or accretion of a discount is discontinued if such loan is reclassified to held for sale. 
  Operating Real Estate  
  Rental and other income from operating real estate is derived from the leasing of space to various types of tenants.  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments.  Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective

  (Unaudited) 

leases.  The excess of rent recognized over the amount contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in receivables on the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company amortizes any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Other income represents revenue from tenant/operator leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by the Company on behalf of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred. 
  In a situation in which a lease(s) associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above- and below-market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and deferred leasing costs).  Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, the Company may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group.  Such amounts are included within rental and other income for above- and below-market lease intangibles and depreciation and amortization for the remaining lease related asset groups in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security.  Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income.   
  Credit Losses and Impairment on Investments 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms.  The Company assesses the credit quality of the portfolio and adequacy of loan loss reserves on a quarterly basis or more frequently as necessary.  Significant judgment of the Company is required in this analysis.  The Company considers the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition of the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located.  Because this determination is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date.  If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the loan, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.  The loan loss reserve for each loan is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses.   
  Income recognition is suspended for a loan at the earlier of the date at which payments become   90  -days past due or when, in the opinion of the Company, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash basis method until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed.  A loan is written off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any impaired CRE debt investments.   
  Operating Real Estate 
  The Company s real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of its operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  A property s value is considered impaired if the Company s estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow generated by the property is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, the Company considers U.S. macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions and asset specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value and recorded in impairment on operating real estate in the consolidated statements of operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any impaired operating real estate.

  (Unaudited) 

An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenants to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, the Company establishes, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.   
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated ventures for which the Company did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, the Company considers U.S. macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any impaired investments in unconsolidated ventures.   
  Real Estate Securities 
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) as any change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.  Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized gain (loss) on investments and other as losses occur.   
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly.  Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security.  When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.  In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses.  The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.  The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.  The portion of OTTI recognized through earnings is accreted back to the amortized cost basis of the security through interest income, while amounts recognized through OCI are amortized over the life of the security with no impact on earnings.  CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow.  The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any OTTI recorded on its CRE securities.   
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  The Prior Advisor, or its affiliates, was entitled to receive reimbursement for costs paid on behalf of the Company in connection with the Offering.  The Company was obligated to reimburse the Prior Advisor for organization and offering costs to the extent the aggregate of selling commissions, dealer manager fees and other organization and offering costs do not exceed   15.0%   of gross offering proceeds from the Total Primary Offering.  The Prior Advisor initially expected reimbursable organization and offering costs would not exceed   $15.0 million  , or   1.5%   of the total proceeds available to be raised from the Total Primary Offering.  Based on gross proceeds raised of   $1,072.9 million   from the Total Primary Offering, the Company incurred reimbursable organization and offering costs, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, of   1.0%  , which was less than the   1.5%   expected.  The Company recorded organization and offering costs each period based upon an allocation determined by the expectation of total organization and offering costs to be reimbursed.  Organization costs were recorded as an expense in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and offering costs were recorded as a reduction to equity.   
  Income Taxes 
  The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT and to comply with the related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code beginning in its taxable year ended December 31, 2010.  Accordingly, the Company will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders as long as certain asset, income and share ownership tests are met.  To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain other requirements.  The Company believes that all of the criteria to maintain the Company s REIT qualification have been met for the applicable periods, but there can be no assurance that these criteria will continue to be met in subsequent periods.   
  
   18 

Table of Contents  
  NORTHSTAR REAL ESTATE INCOME TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and potential interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distributions to its stockholders.  The Company s accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties is to classify these amounts as a component of income tax expense, where applicable. 
  The Company may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes.  Under certain circumstances, federal income and excise taxes may be due on its undistributed taxable income.   
  The Company made a joint election to treat a subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) which may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.  In general, a TRS of the Company may perform non-customary services for tenants, hold assets that the REIT cannot hold directly and may engage in most real estate or non-real estate-related business.   
  Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to taxation by federal, state and local authorities for the periods presented.  Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.  Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted.  A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred taxes.  Current and deferred taxes are recorded on the portion of earnings (losses) recognized by the Company with respect to its interest in TRSs.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the Company s U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements and the federal, state and local tax basis of assets and liabilities as of the consolidated balance sheet date.  The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets (e.g., net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards) and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.  When evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers estimates of expected future taxable income, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available and the general and industry specific economic outlook.  This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general economic environment in future periods.  Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any, are included in income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.   
  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded income tax expense of $  0.8 million   and $  2.3 million  , respectively.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax benefit of $  1.2 million   and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax expense of $  0.4 million  . 
  Other 
  Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   for further disclosure of the Company s significant accounting policies.   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for the Company will be January 1, 2018.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined the Company s Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,

beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, of the guidance on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting.  The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly more information including information used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.

     As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average maturity, including extensions, of CRE debt investments was   4.1 years  . 
  Credit Quality Monitoring 
  CRE debt investments are typically loans secured by direct senior priority liens on real estate properties or by interests in entities that directly own real estate properties, which serve as the primary source of cash for the payment of principal and interest.  The Company evaluates its debt investments at least quarterly and differentiates the relative credit quality principally based on: (i) whether the borrower is currently paying contractual debt service in accordance with its contractual terms and (ii) whether the Company believes the borrower will be able to perform under its contractual terms in the future, as well as the Company s expectations as to the ultimate recovery of principal at maturity.  The Company categorizes a debt investment for which it expects to receive full payment of contractual principal and interest payments as  performing.   The Company will categorize a weaker credit quality debt investment that is currently performing, but for which it believes future collection of all or some portion of principal and interest is in doubt, into a category called  performing with a loan loss reserve.   The Company will categorize a weaker credit quality debt investment that is not performing, which the Company defines as a loan in maturity default and/or past due at least   90 days   on its contractual debt service payments, as a non-performing loan ( NPL ).  The Company s definition of an NPL may differ from that of other companies that track NPLs.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   all   CRE debt investments were performing in accordance with the contractual terms of their governing documents in all material respects and were categorized as performing loans.  There were no CRE debt investments with contractual payments past due as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   two   CRE debt investment contributed more than   10%   of interest income. 
  In connection with a pre-negotiated agreement, in May 2016, as a result of a borrower s inability to pay amounts due under   one   of the Company s debt investments, the Company and the borrower agreed to transfer title of the real estate via deed in lieu of foreclosure to the Company.

PE Investment I 
  In February 2013, the Company completed the initial closing ( PE I Initial Closing ) of PE Investment I which through a preferred investment owns a portfolio of limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds managed by institutional-quality sponsors.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, at the PE I Initial Closing, the full purchase price was funded, excluding future capital commitments.  Accordingly, the Company funded   $118.0 million   and NorthStar Realty (together with the Company, the  NorthStar Entities ) funded   $282.1 million  .  The NorthStar Entities have an aggregate ownership interest in PE Investment I of   51.0%  , of which the Company owns   29.5%   and NorthStar Realty owns   70.5%  .  Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (the  Class B Partner ) contributed its interests in   49   funds subject to the transaction in exchange for all of the Class B partnership interests in PE Investment I.   
  PE Investment I provides for all cash distributions on a priority basis to the NorthStar Entities as follows: (i) first,   85.0%   to the NorthStar Entities and   15.0%   to the Class B Partner until the NorthStar Entities receive a   1.5  x multiple on all of their invested capital, including amounts funded in connection with future capital commitments; (ii) second,   15.0%   to the NorthStar Entities and   85.0%   to the Class B Partner until the Class B Partner receives a return of its then remaining June 30, 2012 capital; and (iii) third,   51.0%   to the NorthStar Entities and   49.0%   to the Class B Partner.  All amounts paid to and received by the NorthStar Entities are based on each partner s proportionate interest.   
  PE Investment IIA 
  In June 2013, the Company, NorthStar Realty and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management ( Vintage Funds ) (each a  Partner ) formed joint ventures and entered into an agreement with Common Pension Fund E, a common trust fund created under New Jersey law ( PE II Seller ), to acquire a portfolio of limited partnership interests in   24   real estate private equity funds managed by institutional-quality sponsors.  The aggregate reported NAV acquired was   $910.0 million   as of September 30, 2012.  The Company, NorthStar Realty and the Vintage Funds each had an initial ownership interest in PE Investment IIA of   15.0%  ,   70.0%   and   15.0%  , respectively.  All amounts paid and received are based on each Partner s proportionate interest.   
  PE Investment IIA paid   $504.8 million   to PE II Seller for all of the fund interests, or   55.0%   of the September 30, 2012 NAV (the  Initial Amount ), and will pay the remaining   $411.4 million  , or   45.0%   of the September 30, 2012 NAV (the  Deferred Amount ), by the last day of the fiscal quarter after the   four   year anniversary following the closing date of each fund interest.  The Company funded all of its proportionate share of the Initial Amount at the initial closing on July 3, 2013.  The Deferred Amount is a liability of PE Investment IIA.  Each Partner, directly or indirectly, guaranteed its proportionate interest of the Deferred Amount.  The Company determined there was an immaterial amount of fair value related to the guarantee.   
  On March 31st of each year, commencing on March 31, 2015 and for a period of   two years   thereafter, PE Investment IIA will pay, within   10   business days of March 31st, an amount necessary to reduce the Deferred Amount by the greater of   15.0%   of the then outstanding Deferred Amount or   15.0%   of the aggregate distributions received by PE Investment IIA during the preceding 12 month period.   
  On the last day of the fiscal quarter after the   four  -year anniversary of the applicable closing date of each fund interest, PE Investment IIA will be required to pay to PE II Seller the then outstanding unpaid Deferred Amount.  PE Investment IIA will receive   100%   of all distributions following the payment of the Deferred Amount.   
  PE Investment IIB 
  In February 2016, the Company s board of directors, including all of its independent directors, approved the purchase of an additional   14.0%   of the PE Investment II transaction ( PE Investment IIB ) from a company managed by the Sponsor, NorthStar Realty.  The Company purchased PE Investment IIB on the same terms and conditions negotiated by another existing and purchasing co-investor in the transaction.  This increased the Company s total ownership from   15.0%   to   29.0%  .  The Company acquired PE Investment IIB for   $26.5 million   based on a NAV of   $660.6 million   as of   September 30, 2015  , adjusted for distributions and contributions.   
  With this add-on investment, the Company will be responsible for   29.0%   of the Deferred Amount.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the combined Deferred Amount for PE Investment IIA and PE Investment IIB was   $85.7 million  .  In April 2016, PE Investment IIA and PE Investment IIB collectively paid   $15.1 million   of the Deferred Amount.

Securitization Financing Transactions 
  The Company entered into   two   securitization financing transactions collectively referred to as securitization financing transactions, collateralized by CRE debt investments originated by the Company and NorthStar Realty.  In January 2015, the outstanding obligations with respect to one of the securitizations were repaid in full. 
  In the event of breaches of certain representations and warranties or a defect in the document of any of the contributed assets to securitization financing transactions provided at the time the Company entered into such securitization financing transactions and contributed the loans that serve as collateral for the securitization, the Company may be required to repurchase certain of those loans or replace the affected contributed asset or make a loss of value payment.  These obligations do not relate to the credit performance of the loans contributed to the securitizations, but only to breaches of specific representations and warranties or a defect in the document of any of the contributed assets to the securitization financing transactions.  Since inception, the Company has not been required to make any repurchases or replace the affected contributed asset or make a loss of value payment nor has the Company received any notice of assertion of a potential breach of representation and warranty or a defect in the document of any of the contributed assets to the securitization financing transactions.  Any payment to repurchase a loan or replace the affected contributed asset or make a loss of value payment would impact the Company s liquidity.  Depending upon the size of any such payment, the impact to liquidity could be material.   
  Securitization 2013-1 
  In August 2013, the Company entered into a   $531.5 million   securitization financing transaction ( Securitization 2013-1 ).

Subsequent to the closing of Securitization 2013-1, the Company contributed   four   additional CRE debt investments with a   $105.5 million   aggregate principal amount.  NorthStar Realty contributed   three   senior loans with an aggregate principal amount of   $79.1 million   at cost to Securitization 2013-1.  The Company accounts for such loans transferred by NorthStar Realty, as loan collateral receivable, related party.  A total of   $382.7 million   of permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market investment-grade securitization bonds were issued, representing an advance rate of   72.0%   with a current weighted average coupon of LIBOR plus   2.97%  .  The Company retained all of the below investment-grade securitization bonds, which the Company refers to as the Company s retained equity interest in Securitization 2013-1.  The Company used the proceeds to repay   $222.7 million   of borrowings on its term loan facilities.  The collateral is used to service the interest payments on the investment-grade securitization bonds and the Company receives the excess cash flow on its retained equity interest.  Securitization 2013-1 is considered a voting interest entity and since the Company has all of the controlling financial interest in Securitization 2013-1, the entity is consolidated by the Company.  As of   September 30, 2016   the principal amount of the loans contributed by NorthStar Realty was $  52.7 million  .

    Related Party Arrangements 
     Advisor 
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor is responsible for managing the Company s affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, originating, acquiring and asset managing investments on behalf of the Company.  The Advisor may delegate certain of its obligations to affiliated entities, which may be organized under the laws of the United States or foreign jurisdictions.  References to the Advisor include the Advisor and any such affiliated entities.  For such services, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, the Advisor receives fees and reimbursement from the Company.  Below is a description and table of the fees and reimbursements incurred to the Advisor.   
  In June 2016, the advisory agreement was renewed for an additional   one  -year term commencing on June 30, 2016, with terms identical to those in effect through June 30, 2016. 
  Fees to Advisor 
  Asset Management Fee 
  The Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to   one  -  twelfth   of   1.25%   of the sum of the amount funded or allocated for CRE investments, including expenses and any financing attributable to such investments, less any principal received on debt and securities investments (or the proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture).   
  Incentive Fee 
  The Advisor is entitled to receive distributions equal to   15.0%   of net cash flows of the Company, whether from continuing operations, repayment of loans, disposition of assets or otherwise, but only after stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their invested capital plus an   8.0%   cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such invested capital.   
  Acquisition Fee 
  The Advisor also receives fees for providing structuring, diligence, underwriting advice and related services in connection with real estate acquisitions equal to   1.0%   of the amount funded or allocated by the Company to originate or acquire investments, including acquisition costs and any financing attributable to such investments (or the proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture).  A fee paid to the Advisor in connection with the origination or acquisition of CRE debt investments is included in CRE debt investments, net on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  A fee incurred related to an equity investment will generally be expensed as incurred.  A fee paid to the Advisor in connection with the acquisition of an equity or debt investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is included in investments in unconsolidated ventures on the consolidated balance sheets.

Disposition Fee 
  For substantial assistance in connection with the sale of investments and based on the services provided, as determined by the Company s independent directors, the Advisor receives a disposition fee of   1.0%   of the contract sales price of each CRE investment sold.  The Company does not pay a disposition fee upon the maturity, prepayment, workout, modification or extension of a CRE debt investment unless there is a corresponding fee paid by the borrower, in which case the disposition fee is the lesser of: (i)   1.0%   of the principal amount of the CRE debt investment prior to such transaction; or (ii) the amount of the fee paid by the borrower in connection with such transaction.  If the Company takes ownership of a property as a result of a workout or foreclosure of a CRE debt investment, the Company will pay a disposition fee upon the sale of such property.  A disposition fee from the sale of an investment is generally expensed and included in asset management and other fees - related party in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.  A disposition fee for a CRE debt investment incurred in a transaction other than a sale is included in CRE debt investments, net on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.   
  Reimbursements to Advisor 
  Operating Costs 
  The Advisor is entitled to receive reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs incurred by the Advisor in connection with administrative services provided to the Company.  The Advisor allocates, in good faith, indirect costs to the Company related to the Advisor s and its affiliates  employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the advisory agreement with the Advisor.  The indirect costs include the Company s allocable share of the Advisor s compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing the Company s affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to the Company s affairs.  The indirect costs also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses.  However, there is no reimbursement for personnel costs related to executive officers (although there may be reimbursement for certain executive officers of the Advisor) and other personnel involved in activities for which the Advisor receives an acquisition fee or a disposition fee.  The Advisor allocates these costs to the Company relative to its and its affiliates  other managed companies in good faith and has reviewed the allocation with the Company s board of directors, including its independent directors.  The Advisor updates the board of directors on a quarterly basis of any material changes to the expense allocation and provides a detailed review to the board of directors, at least annually, and as otherwise requested by the board of directors.  The Company reimburses the Advisor quarterly for operating costs (including the asset management fee) based on a calculation for the   four   preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i)   2.0%   of its average invested assets; or (ii)   25.0%   of its net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period.  Notwithstanding the above, the Company may reimburse the Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if a majority of the Company s independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.  The Company calculates the expense reimbursement quarterly based upon the trailing   twelve  -month period.

PE Investment IIB 
  In February 2016, the Company s board of directors, including all of its independent directors, approved the purchase of an additional   14.0%   of the PE Investment IIA transaction ( PE Investment IIB ) from a company managed by the Sponsor, NorthStar Realty.  The Company purchased PE Investment IIB on the same terms and conditions negotiated by another existing and purchasing unrelated co-investor in the transaction.

The Company acquired PE Investment IIB for   $26.5 million   based on a NAV of   $660.6 million   as of   September 30, 2015  , adjusted for distributions and contributions.  With this add-on investment, the Company will be responsible for   29.0%   of the Deferred Amount, or   $85.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
           9. 
    Equity-Based Compensation 
     The Company adopted a long-term incentive plan, as amended (the  Plan ), which it may use to attract and retain qualified officers, directors, employees and consultants, as well as an independent directors compensation plan, which is a component of the Plan.  Pursuant to the Plan, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s independent and non-management directors were granted a total of   101,204   shares of restricted common stock for an aggregate   $1.0 million  , based on the share price on the date of each grant.  The restricted stock granted prior to 2013 generally vests quarterly over   four   years and the restricted stock granted in and subsequent to 2013 generally vests quarterly over   two   years.  However, the stock will become fully vested on the earlier occurrence of: (i) the termination of the independent or non-management director s service as a director due to his or her death or disability or (ii) a change in control of the Company.   
  The Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of   $56,250   and   $36,563   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $134,528   and   $140,342   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to the issuance of restricted stock to the independent and non-management directors, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  Unvested shares totaled   26,114   and   17,687  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
           10. 
    Stockholders  Equity 
     Common Stock 
  The Company s Total Primary Offering was completed on July 1, 2013.  From inception through the completion of the Total Primary Offering, the Company issued   107.6 million   shares of common stock generating gross proceeds from the Total Primary Offering of   $1.1 billion  .   
  Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
  The Company adopted the DRP through which common stockholders may elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares in additional shares of the Company s common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions.  Following the termination of the Primary Offering in July 2013, the Company continues to offer shares pursuant to the DRP pursuant to an effective registration statement for up to   15 million   shares.   
  In April 2016, the DRP was amended and restated to provide that, effective on   ten   days  notice, the price per share purchased pursuant to the DRP was   $9.87  , which is equal to the estimated value per share of the Company s common stock as of   December 31, 2015  , until such time as the Company establishes a new estimated per share value, at which time the purchase price will adjust to   100%   of such estimated value per share.  The Company expects that the next estimated value per share will be based upon assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016.   
  Prior to the April 2016 amendment, shares issued pursuant to the DRP were priced at   95.0%   of the Company s estimated value per share as of October 31, 2014, or   $9.52  .  Prior to 2015, shares issued pursuant to the DRP were priced at   $9.50   per share.   
  No   selling commissions or dealer manager fees are paid on shares issued pursuant to the DRP.  The board of directors of the Company may amend, suspend or terminate the DRP for any reason upon   ten  -days  notice to participants.   
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company issued   3.4 million   shares totaling   $33.0 million   of proceeds pursuant to the DRP.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company issued   4.6 million   shares totaling   $43.8 million   of proceeds pursuant to the DRP.

     Share Repurchase Program 
  The Company adopted a share repurchase program that may enable stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances (as amended, the  Share Repurchase Program ).  The Company may not repurchase shares unless a stockholder has held shares for   one year  .  However, the Company may repurchase shares held for less than   one year   in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability.  The Company is not obligated to repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program.  The Company may amend, suspend or terminate the Share Repurchase Program at its discretion at any time, provided that any amendment that adversely affects the rights or obligations of a participant will take effect upon   10   days  prior written notice (or   10   business days  prior written notice if related to a change in the number of shares that can be repurchased in a calendar year).  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   3.0 million   shares of common stock for a total of   $29.0 million   or a price of   $9.55   per share.

           11. 
    Non-controlling Interests 
     Operating Partnership 
  Non-controlling interests include the aggregate limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners, other than the Company.  Income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interests is based on the limited partners  ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership.  Income (loss) allocated to the Operating Partnership non-controlling interests for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a de minimis amount.   
  Other

Fair Value Measurement 
  The fair value of financial instruments is categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique and categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.   
  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
              Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
     Determination of Fair Value 
  The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value of assets accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
  Investments in Private Equity Funds 
  The Company accounts for PE Investments at fair value which is determined based on a valuation model using assumptions for the timing and amount of expected future cash flow for income and realization events for the underlying assets in the funds and discount rate.  This fair value measurement is generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The Company is not using the NAV (practical expedient) of the underlying funds for purposes of determining fair value.   
  Real Estate Securities 
  CRE securities are generally valued using a third-party pricing service or broker quotations.  These quotations are not adjusted and are based on observable inputs that can be validated, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Certain CRE securities may be valued based on a single broker quote or an internal price which may have less observable pricing, and as such, would be classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as its knowledge of and experience in the market.

Fair Value Hierarchy 
  Financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The following table presents financial assets that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by level within the fair value hierarchy (dollars in thousands): 

The following table presents additional information about PE Investments which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for which the Company has used Level 3 inputs to determine fair value (dollars in thousands): 

_____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents initial investments and subsequent contributions. 
     For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company used discounted cash flow models to quantify Level 3 fair value measurements on a recurring basis.  The key unobservable inputs used in this analysis included discount rates which had a weighted average of   16.2%   as of   September 30, 2016   and includes timing and amount of expected future cash flow.  Significant increases or decreases in any one of the inputs described above in isolation may result in significantly different fair value of the financial assets and liabilities using such Level 3 inputs.   
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a non-recurring basis.   
  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an unrealized loss of less than   $0.1 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, for financial assets for which the fair value option was elected.  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded an unrealized loss of   $3.8 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively, for financial assets for which the fair value option was elected.  These amounts, when incurred, are recorded as unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.   
  Fair Value Option 
  The Company has historically elected not to apply the fair value option for the financial assets and liabilities existing at the time of adoption or at the time the Company recognizes the eligible item for the purpose of consistent accounting application.  The Company may elect the fair value option for certain of its financial assets or liabilities due to the nature of the instrument.  In the case of PE Investments, the Company elected the fair value option because management believes it is a more useful presentation for such investments.  The Company determined recording the PE Investments based on the change in fair value of projected future cash flow from one period to another better represents the underlying economics of the respective investment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  In addition to the above disclosures regarding financial assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of fair value about all financial instruments.  The following disclosure of estimated fair value of financial instruments was determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value. 
  The following table presents the principal amount, carrying value and fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

______________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The fair value of other financial instruments not included in this table is estimated to approximate their carrying value. 
               (3) 
    Refer to  Determination of Fair Value  above for disclosure of methodologies used to determine fair value. 
     Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of the reporting date.  Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect fair value, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.   
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  For CRE debt investments, fair value was approximated by comparing the current yield to the estimated yield for newly originated loans with similar credit risk or the market yield at which a third party might expect to purchase such investment.  Fair value was determined assuming fully-extended maturities regardless of structural or economic tests required to achieve such extended maturities.  These fair value measurements of CRE debt are generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   
  Securitization Bonds Payable, Net 
  Securitization bonds payable, net are valued using quotations from nationally recognized financial institutions that generally acted as underwriter for the transactions.  These quotations are not adjusted and are generally based on observable inputs that can be validated, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   
  Mortgage Notes Payable, Net 
  For mortgage notes payable, net, the Company primarily uses rates currently available with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate fair value.  These measurements are determined using comparable U.S. Treasury rates as of the end of the reporting period.  These fair value measurements are based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Credit Facilities 
  The Company has amounts outstanding under   six   credit facilities.  All credit facilities bear floating rates of interest.  As of the reporting date, the Company believes the carrying value approximates fair value.  These fair value measurements are based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
   The Company currently conducts its business through the following   four   segments, which are based on how management reviews and manages its business: 
             
    Commercial Real Estate Debt -   Focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing CRE debt investments including first mortgage loans, subordinate interests and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans, as well as preferred equity interests. 
                
    Commercial Real Estate Equity -   Focused on direct ownership in real estate, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner s equity and indirect interests in real estate through PE Investments since the underlying collateral in the funds is primarily real estate.  May include REO where the Company takes title to collateral in connection with a CRE debt investment. 
                
    Commercial Real Estate Securities -   Focused on investing in CMBS, unsecured REIT debt, CDO notes and other securities. 
                
    Corporate   - The corporate segment includes corporate level asset management and other fees - related party and general and administrative expenses. 
     The Company may also own investments indirectly through a joint venture. 
  The Company primarily generates revenue from net interest income on the CRE debt and securities portfolios, equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures, including from PE Investments, and from rental and other income from its real estate equity investments.  The Company s income is primarily derived through the difference between revenue and the cost at which the Company is able to finance its investments.  The Company may also acquire investments which generate attractive returns without any leverage.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1.  Financial Statements  of this report.  References to  we,    us,   or  our   refer to NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.   
   
  Introduction 
  We were formed to originate, acquire and asset manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate, or CRE, debt, select equity and securities investments, predominantly in the United States.  We may also invest in CRE investments internationally.  CRE debt investments include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests.  Real estate equity investments include direct ownership in properties, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner s equity, as well as indirect interests in real estate through real estate private equity funds, or PE Investments.  CRE securities primarily consist of commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and may include unsecured real estate investment trust, or REIT debt, collateralized debt obligations, or CDO, notes and other securities.  In addition, we may own investments through joint ventures.  We were formed in January 2009 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in October 2010.  We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.  We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.   
  We are externally managed and have no employees.  Prior to June 30, 2014, we were managed by an affiliate of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF), or NorthStar Realty.  Effective June 30, 2014, NorthStar Realty spun-off its asset management business into a separate publicly traded company, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), our Sponsor.  Our Sponsor and its affiliates provide asset management and other services to us, NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. (NYSE: NRE), other sponsored public retail-focused companies and any other companies our Sponsor and its affiliates may manage in the future, or collectively the NSAM Managed Companies, both in the United States and internationally.  As of   September 30, 2016  , NSAM has an aggregate of   $39.3 billion   of assets under management, adjusted for commitments to acquire or sell certain investments by NSAM and the NSAM Managed Companies.  Concurrent with the spin-off, affiliates of our Sponsor entered into a new advisory agreement with us and each of the other NSAM Managed Companies.  Pursuant to our advisory agreement, NSAM J-NSI Ltd, an affiliate of our Sponsor, or our Advisor, agreed to manage our day-to-day operations on terms substantially similar to those set forth in our prior advisory agreement with NS Real Estate Income Trust Advisor, LLC, or our Prior Advisor.  References to our Prior Advisor herein refer to the services performed by and fees paid and accrued to our Prior Advisor during the period prior to June 30, 2014.  The spin-off of NorthStar Realty s asset management business had no impact on our operations.   
  In June 2016, our Sponsor announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. or Colony, providing for the combination of the Sponsor, NorthStar Realty and Colony into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sponsor, as the surviving publicly-traded company for the combined organization that, upon and following the effective time of the mergers, will be named Colony NorthStar, Inc. or Colony NorthStar.  As a result of the mergers, Colony NorthStar will be an internally-managed equity REIT, with a diversified real estate and investment management platform.  In addition, following the mergers, our Advisor will be a subsidiary of Colony NorthStar.  This transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by our Sponsor s, NorthStar Realty s and Colony s respective shareholders.  There is no guarantee this transaction will close on the contemplated terms or within the anticipated timeframe, or at all.  We do not expect that this transaction will have a material impact on our operations. 
  Our primary investment types are as follows: 
             
    Commercial Real Estate Debt -   Our CRE debt investments include first mortgage loans, subordinate interests and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans, as well as preferred equity interests. 
                
    Commercial Real Estate Equity -   Our CRE equity investments include direct ownership in real estate, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner s equity and indirect interests in real estate through PE Investments since the underlying collateral in the funds is primarily real estate.  May include real estate owned, or REO, where we take title to collateral in connection with a CRE debt investment. 
                
    Commercial Real Estate Securities -   Our CRE securities investments may include CMBS, unsecured REIT debt, CDO notes and other securities. 
     We believe that our targeted investment types are complementary to each other due to their overlapping sources of investment opportunities, common reliance on real estate fundamentals and ability to apply similar portfolio management and servicing skills to maximize value and to protect shareholder capital.  We believe our Advisor s platform and experience provide us the flexibility to invest across the real estate capital structure.

We initially registered to offer up to 100,000,000 shares pursuant to our primary offering to the public, or our Primary Offering, and up to 10,526,315 shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRP, which we refer to collectively as the Offering.  In April 2013, our board of directors authorized the reallocation of shares available under our DRP to our Primary Offering.  Our Primary Offering (including 7.6 million shares reallocated from our DRP, or our Total Primary Offering) was completed on July 1, 2013 and all of the shares initially registered for our Offering were issued.  As a result of an additional registration statement to offer up to 10.0 million shares pursuant to our DRP, we continue to offer DRP shares beyond our Total Primary Offering.   
  We have raised total gross proceeds of   $1.1 billion   in the Offering.  In addition, from the close of the Primary Offering through   November 4, 2016  , we have raised an additional   $0.2 billion   in gross proceeds pursuant to the DRP.

  Underwriting Process 
  We use a rigorous investment and underwriting process that has been developed and utilized by our Advisor s and its affiliates  senior management teams leveraging their extensive commercial real estate expertise over many years and real estate cycles which focuses on some or all of the following factors designed to ensure each investment is evaluated appropriately: (i) macroeconomic conditions that may influence operating performance; (ii) fundamental analysis of underlying real estate, including tenant rosters,  
  
   43 

Table of Contents  

lease terms, zoning, necessary licensing, operating costs and the asset s overall competitive position in its market; (iii) real estate market factors that may influence the economic performance of the investment, including leasing conditions and overall competition; (iv) the operating expertise and financial strength and reputation of a tenant, operator, partner or borrower; (v) the cash flow in place and projected to be in place over the term of the investment and potential return; (vi) the appropriateness of the business plan and estimated costs associated with tenant buildout, repositioning or capital improvements; (vii) an internal and third-party valuation of a property, investment basis relative to the competitive set and the ability to liquidate an investment through a sale or refinancing; (viii) review of third-party reports including appraisals, engineering and environmental reports; (ix) physical inspections of properties and markets; (x) the overall legal structure of the investment, contractual implications and the lenders  rights; and (xi) the tax and accounting impact.  
  Consistent with our investment strategy, a majority of our diversified portfolio is comprised of CRE debt investments and CRE securities.  The remainder of the portfolio consists of real estate equity investments, including PE investments.   
  The following section describes the major CRE asset classes in which we may invest and actively manage to maximize value and to protect capital.   
  Commercial Real Estate Debt 
  Overview 
  Our CRE debt investment strategy is focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing CRE debt investments, including first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests.   
  We emphasize direct origination of our debt investments as this allows us a greater degree of control over how they are underwritten and structured and it provides us the opportunity to syndicate all or portions of the loan (senior or subordinate interests) to maximize returns, if desired.  Further, it facilitates a more direct relationship with our borrowers which helps us maintain a robust pipeline and provides an opportunity for us to earn origination and other fees. 
  Our Portfolio 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , which may be adjusted for acquisitions, dispositions, and commitments to purchase and sell through   November 4, 2016  ,   $747.1 million  , or   44.0%  , of our assets were invested in CRE debt, consisting of   18   loans with an average investment size of   $41.5 million  .  The weighted average extended maturity of our CRE debt portfolio is   4.1 years  .   
  The following table presents a summary of our CRE debt investments as of   September 30, 2016  , which may be adjusted for acquisitions, dispositions, and commitments to purchase and sell through   November 4, 2016   (refer to the below and  Recent Developments ) (dollars in thousands):

              (3) 
    Includes a fixed minimum LIBOR rate, or LIBOR floor, as applicable.  As of   November 4, 2016  , we had   $505.9 million   principal amount of floating-rate loans subject to a weighted average LIBOR floor of   0.32%  . 
              (4) 
    Excludes an   $8.6 million   proportionate interest in a preferred equity investment owned by a joint venture partner.

Real Estate 
  Our real estate equity investment strategy focuses on direct ownership in commercial real estate with an emphasis on properties, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner s equity, and PE Investments, both of which have stable cash flow and/or the potential to appreciate in value and therefore help overcome our upfront fees and expenses.  In addition, we may own investments through joint ventures with one or more partners and REO where we have taken title to collateral. 
  Real Estate Properties 
  As part of our real estate properties strategy, we explore a variety of real estate investments including multi-tenant office, multifamily, student housing and industrial.  These properties are typically well-located with strong operating partners and we believe offer both attractive cash flow and returns.

As of   September 30, 2016  , which may be adjusted for acquisitions, dispositions, and commitments to purchase and sell through   November 4, 2016  ,   $614.9 million  , or   36.2%  , of our assets were invested in real estate properties and our portfolio was   92%   occupied.  The following table presents our real estate property investments as of   September 30, 2016  , which may be adjusted for acquisitions, dispositions, and commitments to purchase and sell through   November 4, 2016   (refer to the below and  Recent Developments ) (dollars in thousands):

    Based on cost which includes purchase price allocations related to net intangibles, deferred costs and other assets. 
      Private Equity Investments 
  Our real estate equity investment strategy includes PE Investments.  We classify our PE Investments as equity investments since the underlying collateral in the funds is primarily real estate.  We believe the investments provide diversity and have the potential to appreciate in value and therefore help overcome our upfront fees and expenses. 
  Our PE Investments own limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds acquired in the secondary market and managed by institutional-quality sponsors, which we refer to as fund interests.  As of   September 30, 2016  , which may be adjusted for acquisitions, dispositions, and commitments to purchase and sell through   November 4, 2016  ,   $197.1 million  , or   11.6%  , of our assets were invested in PE Investments through unconsolidated ventures. 
  The following tables present a summary of our PE Investments (dollars in millions):

    Represents implied leverage for funds with investment-level financing, calculated as the underlying borrowing divided by assets at fair value. 
              (4) 
    We, together with NorthStar Realty, have an ownership interest in PE Investment I of   51.0%  , of which we own   29.5%   and NorthStar Realty owns   70.5%  . 
              (5) 
    We, NorthStar Realty and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management each had an initial ownership interest in PE Investment IIA of   15.0%  ,   70.0%   and   15.0%  , respectively.  PE Investment IIA paid an initial amount of   $504.8 million   and will pay the remaining   $411.4 million  , or   45.0%   of the purchase price, or the Deferred Amount, by the last day of the fiscal quarter after the four year anniversary of the applicable closing date of each fund interest.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of the Deferred Amount was   $44.3 million  . 
               (7) 
    In March 2016, we acquired PE Investment III for   $15.1 million   based on a NAV of March 31, 2015, adjusted for contributions and distributions from such date.  At the time of closing, we paid   $4.2 million  , net of a   $1.8 million   deposit for a total of   $6.0 million  , or   40%   of the purchase price adjusted for contributions and distributions.  The remaining portion of the Deferred Purchase Price, or approximately   $8.9 million  , will be paid in two installments on   December 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2017  .

     Real Estate Securities 
  Our CRE securities investments include CMBS and may include unsecured REIT debt and CDO notes backed primarily by CRE securities and debt.

Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows 
  We primarily generate revenue from net interest income on our CRE debt and securities investments and net rental and other operating income from our real estate properties.  Additionally, we record equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures, including from PE Investments.  Our income is primarily derived through the difference between net revenue and the cost at which we are able to finance our investments.  We may also acquire investments which generate attractive returns without any leverage.   
   
  Profitability and Performance Metrics 
  We calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO, (see  Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations  for a description of these metrics), to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business. 
   
  Outlook and Recent Trends 
  The U.S. economy demonstrated improvement in 2015, which prompted the Federal Reserve in December 2015 to raise the Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nine years.  The U.S. economy has continued to show strength throughout 2016 with approximately 5% unemployment and positive trends in the housing market.  Despite this, concerns still remain regarding low inflation in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, oil price instability, slow gross domestic product and global growth, the U.S. Presidential election and increasing international market volatility.  Many other global central banks have been easing monetary policy to combat low inflation and stagnant growth and the Federal Reserve is signaling that it may further adjust the Federal Funds Rate in 2016, especially in light of certain global events described below. 
  In June 2016, a non-binding referendum was passed in the United Kingdom supporting the exit from the European Union which in turn resulted in considerable instability to global markets and currencies, especially European markets, the U.K. s economy and the British Pound Sterling which has continued to devalue.  In addition, dramatic political change in the United Kingdom has resulted including the election of a new Prime Minister in July 2016.  Much uncertainty remains as to the process for a potential March 2017 start to  Brexit  and the long-term impacts to the global, European and British economies.  Sovereign banks have been actively easing monetary policy resulting in sustained low-to-negative interest rate environments, while several key global economies, including England, Germany and Japan, have recently reached positive interest rate territory in the benchmark 10-year paper.  The Bank of England and other central banks remain poised for further monetary and financial policy action should the U.K. s economy enter a downturn or as a tool to encourage positive economic growth.  Despite the unexpected result of the referendum, markets have generally continued to function properly and in some cases recovered from the initial shock (e.g., U.S. equity markets).  The potential for ongoing volatility and uncertainty resulting from  Brexit  and other geopolitical or financial unrest may have a significant impact on the overall global economic environment. 
  CRE fundamentals remain relatively healthy across U.S. property types.  Investor demand in 2015 for commercial real estate increased transaction activity and prices as rent and vacancy fundamentals improved across most property sectors.  Private capital investment remained aggressive throughout 2015 and, although public markets slowed at the beginning of 2016, continued to remain aggressive throughout 2016, leading to continued appreciation in real estate values.  However, property price appreciation has slowed and there is speculation that certain markets may be entering the late stage of the current real estate cycle and, in some markets, rent growth and capitalization rate compression has started to slow.  One of the factors that may contribute to periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market is the large amount of maturing commercial real estate debt that may have difficulties being refinanced.  Approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States is scheduled to mature through 2018.  While there appears to be a supply of available liquidity to satisfy many of these maturities, 2016 private-label CMBS year-to-date is 43% compared to the same period in 2015 and industry experts estimate a projected total origination volume of approximately $65 billion for 2016 versus volume of $95 billion in 2015.  Despite non-traditional lenders significantly increasing loan origination volumes, this trend is potentially one symptom that could point to broader difficulties in the ability of the market to refinance the large amount of maturing real estate debt and may lead to a negative impact on the overall real estate market. 
  Non-traded REIT capital raising was down year over year by 20% in 2014 (with approximately $16 billion in equity raised) and 36% in 2015.  We were able to gain market share with our non-traded REITs during this time, having a 7% market share in 2014 increasing to 13% in 2015.  In April 2016, the retail industry experienced the implementation of FINRA 15-02 related to disclosure on broker-dealer account statements and the final ruling of the U.S. Department of Labor s  fiduciary  standard for retirement accounts.  Although the final fiduciary rule was more favorable to both sponsors and broker-dealers in the retail industry than initial proposals, the impact of both of these events has been a sharp decline in capital raising in the retail market as evidenced by the overall non-traded REIT capital raising being down 55% year-to-date through September 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  Our Sponsor has seen sales and its market share decline in 2016 as a result. However, we anticipate the overall market and opportunity for retail products to improve as it adapts to these changes.

Our Strategy 
  Our primary business objectives are to originate and acquire real estate-related investments, with a focus on CRE debt that we expect will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, stable cash flow for distributions and provide downside protection to our stockholders.  Some of our CRE debt investments may be considered transitional in nature because the borrower or owner may have a business plan to improve the collateral and, as a result, we generally require the borrower to fund interest or other reserves, whether through loan proceeds or otherwise, to support debt service payments and capital expenditures.  We, our borrower or owner, and possibly a guarantor, may be required to refill these reserves should they become deficient during the applicable period for any reason.  We will also seek to realize growth in the value of our real estate equity investments through appreciation and/or by opportunistic sales to maximize value.  We believe that our Advisor, and its affiliates, have a platform that derives a potential competitive advantage from the combination of experience, proven track record of successfully managing public companies, deep industry relationships and market-leading CRE credit underwriting and capital markets expertise which enables us to manage credit risk across our investments as well as to structure and finance our assets efficiently.  In addition, we believe that such platform, and our Advisor s and its affiliates  capabilities, will be strengthened and enhanced as a result of the pending mergers of our Sponsor, Colony and NorthStar Realty as discussed above.  We believe that our targeted investment types are complementary to each other due to their overlapping sources of investment opportunities, common reliance on CRE fundamentals and ability to apply similar portfolio management and servicing skills to maximize value and to protect capital.  We use the proceeds from our DRP and other financing sources to carry out our primary business objectives of originating and acquiring real estate-related investments.   
  We began raising capital in late 2010 and completed our Total Primary Offering on July 1, 2013.  Since the successful completion of our Total Primary Offering, we have only been raising new equity through our DRP.  We also entered into term loan facilities that provide up to an aggregate of   $550.0 million   to finance the origination of CRE first mortgage loans, our Term Loan Facilities, and our CMBS facilities to make new investments in CMBS, or our CMBS Facilities, and collectively our Credit Facilities.  In November 2012 and August 2013, we closed two securitization financing transactions to finance debt investments on a permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market basis.  The debt investments had previously been financed on our Term Loan Facilities.  Our real estate portfolio is financed with long-term, non-recourse mortgage notes.  
  The following table presents our investment activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and from inception through   September 30, 2016  , adjusted for our acquisitions and commitments through   November 4, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents principal amount for real estate debt and securities and cost for real estate equity investments, which includes net purchase price allocation related to net intangibles, deferred costs and other assets. 
               (3) 
    Excludes contributions related to future funding commitments. 
      
  Financing Strategy 
  We use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy and we seek to match-fund our assets and liabilities by having similar maturities and like-kind interest rate benchmarks (fixed or floating) to manage refinancing and interest rate risk and utilize non-recourse liabilities whenever possible.  Our Advisor is responsible for managing such refinancing and interest rate risk on our behalf.  We intend to pursue a variety of financing arrangements such as securitization financing transactions, credit facilities, mortgage notes and other term borrowings.  We continue to seek and prefer long-term, non-recourse financing, including non mark-to-market financing that may be available through securitization.   
  Although we have a limitation on the maximum leverage for our portfolio, which approximates   75%   of the aggregate cost of our investments, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated venture investments, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, we do not have a targeted debt-to-equity ratio on an asset-by-asset basis, as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we finance depends on the specific credit characteristics of each asset.  We use leverage for the sole purpose of financing our investments and diversifying our equity and we do not employ leverage to speculate on changes in interest rates.  Our current overall portfolio leverage is   48%  .

Borrowing levels for CRE investments may change depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing.  Our financing strategy for our CRE debt and securities investments is dependent on our ability to obtain match-funded borrowings at rates that provide a positive net spread, generally using credit facilities and securitization financing transactions.  Our financing strategy for our real estate is typically to use long-term, non-recourse mortgage notes. 
  Our credit facilities currently include   three   secured term loan facilities, or our Term Loan Facilities, that provide for an aggregate of up to   $550.0 million   to finance the origination of first mortgage loans and senior loan participations secured by commercial real estate and   five   CMBS Facilities to finance the acquisition of CMBS.  In November 2012 and August 2013, we closed securitization financing transactions, which provide permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing for our debt investments that were mainly previously financed on our Term Loan Facilities.  In January 2015, the outstanding obligations with respect to one of the securitizations were repaid in full.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $64.9 million   issued as part of Securitization 2013-1 (as described below),   $305.7 million   outstanding under our Term Loan Facilities and   $18.0 million   outstanding under our CMBS Facilities.  As of   November 4, 2016  , we have   $308.0 million   of available borrowing under our Term Loan Facilities.  Refer to  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for further disclosure regarding our securitization financing transactions. 
   
  Portfolio Management 
  Our Advisor and its affiliates maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management and servicing team, regular management meetings and an exhaustive quarterly credit review process.  These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify asset-specific credit issues and trends on a portfolio-wide basis.  Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that our Advisor s review will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from investments that are not identified during these credit reviews.  The portfolio management team, under the direction of our Advisor s investment committee, uses many methods to actively manage our asset base to preserve our income and capital.  Credit risk management is the ability to manage our assets in a manner that preserves principal/cost and income and minimizes credit losses that could decrease income and portfolio value.  For CRE debt and real estate investments, frequent re-underwriting and dialogue with borrowers/tenants/partners and regular inspections of our collateral and owned properties have proven to be an effective process for identifying issues early.  During the quarterly credit review, or more frequently as necessary, investments are put on highly-monitored status and identified for possible loan loss reserves/asset impairment, as appropriate, based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in collateral performance and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment.  Our Advisor uses an experienced portfolio management and servicing team that monitors these factors on our behalf.   
  Our investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstances among other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment.  An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenants to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rents receivable based upon an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.   
  Each of our debt investments is secured by CRE collateral and requires customized portfolio management and servicing strategies for dealing with potential credit situations.  The complexity of each situation depends on many factors, including the number of properties, the type of property, macro and local market conditions impacting supply/demand, cash flow and the financial condition of our collateral and our borrowers /tenants  ability to further support the collateral.  Further, many of our investments may be considered transitional in nature because the business plan is to re-position, re-develop or otherwise lease-up the property in order to improve the collateral.  At the time of origination or acquisition, the underlying property revenues may not be sufficient to support debt service, lease payments or generate positive net operating income.  The business plan may necessitate an interest or lease reserve or other reserves, whether through proceeds from our loans, borrowings, offering proceeds or otherwise, to support debt service or lease payments and capital expenditures during the implementation of the business plan.  There may also be a requirement for the borrower, tenant, guarantor or us, to refill these reserves should they become deficient during the applicable period for any reason.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , each of our CRE debt investments was performing in accordance with the contractual terms of its governing documents in all material respects.  There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the governing documents or underwriting and we may, in the future, record loan loss reserves/asset impairment, as appropriate, if required.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us, our operating partnership, or Operating Partnership, and our consolidated subsidiaries.  We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, if any, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.   
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.  We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.   
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests.  We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.   
  We evaluate our investments and financings, including investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions, if any, to determine whether each investment or financing is a VIE.  We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or a simple majority vote.   
  We perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.   
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  A non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.   
  Under the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity s net income (loss).  Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents.  An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of preferred returns and allocation formulas, if any, as described in such governing documents.  Equity method investments are recognized using a cost accumulation model in which the investment is recognized based on the cost to the investor, which includes acquisition fees.  We record as an expense certain acquisition costs and fees associated with consolidated investments deemed to be business combinations and capitalizes these costs for investments deemed to be acquisitions of an asset, including an equity method investment. 
  
   51 

Table of Contents  

We may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option.  We elected the fair value option for PE Investments.  We record the change in fair value for our share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).   
  We may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if we determine the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant.  Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.   
  Fair Value Option 
  The fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition.  We will generally not elect the fair value option for our assets and liabilities.  However, we have elected the fair value option for PE Investments.  Any change in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made is recognized in earnings.  
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  CRE debt investments are generally intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees, premium and discount.  CRE debt investments that are deemed to be impaired are carried at amortized cost less a loan loss reserve, if deemed appropriate, which approximates fair value.  CRE debt investments where we do not have the intent to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until its expected payoff are classified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated value.   
  We may syndicate a portion of the CRE debt investments that we originate or sell the CRE debt investments individually.  When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we will no longer recognize the CRE debt investment sold as an asset and will recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the CRE debt investment sold.  Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in interest income on the consolidated statement of operations.  Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of interest income. 
  Operating Real Estate  
  Operating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life.  We account for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, improvements and other identified intangibles.  Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations.   
  We refer to real estate acquired in connection with a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or a consensual modification of a loan as REO.  We evaluate whether an REO, herein collectively referred to as taking title to collateral, constitutes a business and whether business combination accounting is appropriate.  Any excess upon taking title to collateral between the carrying value of a loan over the estimated fair value of the property is charged to provision for loan losses. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  We classify our CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value.  Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, in our consolidated statements of equity.  
  Fair Value Measurement 
  The fair value of financial instruments is categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique and categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.   
  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
     
   52 

Table of Contents  

Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
     Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   
  Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as our knowledge and experience of the market.   
  With respect to valuation for CRE securities, we generally obtain at least one quote from a pricing service or broker.  Furthermore, we may use internal pricing models to establish arm s length prices.  Generally, the quote from the pricing service is used to determine fair value for the securities.  The quotes are not adjusted.  The pricing service uses market-based measurements based on valuation techniques that reflect market participants  assumptions and maximize the use of relevant observable inputs including prices for similar assets, benchmark yield curves and market corroborated inputs such as contractual terms, discount rates for similar securities and credit (such as credit support and delinquency rates).  We believe such broker quote is generally based on a market transaction of comparable securities.   
  To determine the fair value of CRE securities, we maintain a comprehensive quarterly process that includes a valuation committee comprised of senior members of the investment and accounting teams that is designed to enable management to ensure the prices used are representative of fair value and the instruments are properly classified pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.   
  Initially, a member of the investment team on the valuation committee reviews the prices at quarter end to ensure current market conditions are fairly presented.  The investment team is able to assess these values because they are actively engaged in the market, reviewing bid lists, recent sales and frequently have discussions with various banks and other financial institutions regarding the state of the market.  We then perform a variety of analyses to ensure the quotes are in a range which we believe to be representative of fair value and to validate the quotes obtained and used in determining the ultimate value used in the financial statements.  At the portfolio level, we evaluate the overall change in fair value versus the overall change in the market.  We review significant changes in fair value for individual instruments, both positive and negative, from the prior period.  We perform back testing on any securities sold to validate the quotes used for the prior quarter.  Where multiple quotes are available, we evaluate any large variance between the high and low price.  We obtain any available market data that provides insight into the price through recent or comparable security trades, multiple broker bids and other pertinent information.  This data may be available through the pricing service or based on data directly available to us.  If as part of any of these processes, we are aware of data which we believe better supports the fair value, we challenge the quote provided by either the pricing service or broker.  Any discrepancy identified from our processes are reviewed and resolved.  The valuation committee approves the final prices.  We believe these procedures are designed to enable us to estimate fair value.   
  Once we determine fair value of CRE securities, we review to ensure the instrument is properly classified pursuant to the fair value hierarchy consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, through our understanding of the valuation methodologies used by the pricing service via discussion with representatives of the pricing service and review of any documentation describing its valuation methodology.   
  Generally, when fair value is based on the pricing service or multiple broker quotes, we believe, based on our analysis, such quotes are based on observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2.  Where the price is based on either a single broker quote or an internal pricing model, we generally consider such price to be based on less observable data and therefore classify such instruments as Level 3.   
  Revenue Recognition 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in  
  
   53 

Table of Contents  

our consolidated statements of operations.  The amortization of a premium or accretion of a discount is discontinued if such loan is reclassified to held for sale.   
  Operating Real Estate  
  Rental and other income from operating real estate is derived from the leasing of space to various types of tenants.  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments.  Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.  The excess of rent recognized over the amount contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in receivables on our consolidated balance sheets.  We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Other income represents revenue from tenant/operator leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by us on behalf of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred. 
  In a situation in which a lease(s) associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, we evaluate the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above- and below-market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and deferred leasing costs).  Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, we may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group.  Such amounts are included within rental and other income for above- and below-market lease intangibles and depreciation and amortization for the remaining lease related asset groups in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security.  Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income.   
  Credit Losses and Impairment on Investments 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms.  We assess the credit quality of the portfolio and adequacy of loan loss reserves on a quarterly basis or more frequently as necessary.  Significant judgment of management is required in this analysis.  We consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition of the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located.  Because this determination is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date.  If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the loan, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.  The loan loss reserve for each loan is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses.   
  Income recognition is suspended for a loan at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90-days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash basis method until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed.  A loan is written off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any impaired CRE debt investments.

Operating Real Estate  
  Our real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  A property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow generated by the property is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, management considers U.S. macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions and asset specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value and recorded in impairment on operating real estate in our consolidated statements of operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any impaired operating real estate.   
  An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenants to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.   
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  We review our investments in unconsolidated ventures for which we did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, management considers U.S. macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated statements of operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any impaired investments in unconsolidated ventures. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment or OTTI as any change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.  Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized gain (loss) on investments and other as losses occur.   
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly.  Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security.  When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.  In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses.  The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.  The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated statements of equity.  The portion of OTTI recognized through earnings is accreted back to the amortized cost basis of the security through interest income, while amounts recognized through OCI are amortized over the life of the security with no impact on earnings.  CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow.  The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any OTTI recorded on our CRE securities.   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.   
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  As such, this standard resulted in  
  
   55 

Table of Contents  

the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently assessing the impact, if any, of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting.  The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly more information including information used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

General and administrative expenses decreased   $0.6 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as a result of lower operating expenses reimbursed to our Advisor. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $  3.1 million   as a result of the final purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2015 related to the completion of two purchase price allocations for operating real estate acquired in 2015.  This decrease was partially offset by a preliminary purchase price allocation related to an operating real estate portfolio acquired in 2016. 
  Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded an unrealized loss of less than $0.1 million and   $3.8 million  , respectively, related to our PE Investments.

  Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded an unrealized loss of   $3.4 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively, related to our PE Investments.  
  Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures  
  Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures decreased   $8.3 million   as a result of a decrease in earnings from PE Investments and the sale of a loan held in a joint venture in January 2016.   
  Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded income tax expense of   $2.3 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, related to our PE Investments.   
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We require capital to fund our investment activities, pay operating expenses and to make distributions.  Our capital sources may include cash flow from operations, net proceeds from asset repayments and sales, securitization financing transactions, borrowings under our Credit Facilities, mortgage notes and other term borrowings and proceeds from our DRP.  As of   November 4, 2016  , we had current investable cash (excluding property level and liquidity requirements) of   $115.3 million  .   
  Securitization Financing Transactions 
  We entered into two securitization financing transactions in 2012 and 2013 that provide permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing for a portion of our CRE debt investments that were generally initially financed on our Term Loan Facilities.  In January 2015, the outstanding obligations with respect to one of the securitizations were repaid in full.  In the future, we expect to execute similar transactions to finance our newly-originated debt investments that might initially be financed on our Term Loan Facilities, although there is no assurance that will be the case.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $71.0 million   carrying value of CRE debt investments financed with   $64.9 million   of securitization bonds.   
  Securitization 2013-1 
  In August 2013, we closed our $531.5 million Securitization 2013-1.  We, through our subsidiaries, initially contributed eight CRE debt investments with a $346.1 million aggregate principal amount and NorthStar Realty, through its subsidiaries, transferred three senior loans with an aggregate principal amount of $79.1 million at cost to Securitization 2013-1.  We account for such loans transferred by NorthStar Realty, as a loan collateral receivable, related party.  Subsequent to the closing of Securitization 2013-1, we contributed four additional CRE debt investments with a $105.5 million aggregate principal balance.  A total of $382.7 million of permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market investment-grade securitization bonds were issued, representing an advance rate of 72.0% at a weighted average coupon of LIBOR plus 2.72%.  We retained all of the below investment-grade bonds in Securitization 2013-1.  The documents that govern Securitization 2013-1 require that the underlying assets meet a collateral value coverage test, or OC test, and an interest coverage test, or IC test (as defined by each applicable governing document) in order for us to receive regular cash flow distributions and defaults in our CRE debt investments, among other things, can negatively impact the OC and IC tests.  Failing such tests means that cash flow that would normally be distributed to us would be used to amortize the investment-grade securitization bonds until the tests are back in compliance.  In such cases, this could decrease cash available to pay our distributions and affect compliance with REIT requirements.

The following table presents the OC and IC cushion as of the closing date of the transaction and the remittance report dated closest to   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

While our Advisor devotes a significant amount of resources to managing our existing investments, including assets collateralizing Securitization 2013-1, maintaining compliance with these tests is not a certainty. 
  Credit Facilities 
  We currently have   eight   Credit Facilities including   three   Term Loan Facilities that provide up to an aggregate of   $550.0 million   to finance the origination of first mortgage loans and senior loan participations secured by commercial real estate and four CMBS Facilities.  The interest rate and advance rate depend on asset type and characteristic.  Maturity dates of our Term Loan Facilities range from March 2017 to October 2018 and   all   have extensions available at our option, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, with maturity dates ranging from March 2018 to October 2021.  The advance rate and maturity date of our CMBS Facilities depend upon asset type.  Our Credit Facilities contain representations, warranties, covenants, conditions precedent to funding, events of default and indemnities that are customary for agreements of these types.  We are currently in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our Credit Facilities.   
  Offering 
  We are no longer raising capital from our Primary Offering and we have invested substantially all of the net proceeds from our Primary Offering.  Since the successful completion of our Primary Offering, we have only been raising new equity capital through our DRP, and as such, do not expect significant new investment activity.  However, as investments are repaid or sold, we expect that those proceeds will be reinvested.  Our inability to invest these proceeds could reduce our net income and limit our ability to make distributions.  Further, we have certain fixed direct and indirect operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly-registered REIT.  We expect our net income from operations will be sufficient to cover such expenses.   
  Our charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300% of our net assets.  We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by our stockholders.  An approximation of this leverage calculation is   75.0%   of the cost of our investments, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated venture investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our leverage as a percentage of our cost of investments was   48.0%  .   
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use or have used our capital resources to make certain payments to our Advisor, our Prior Advisor and NorthStar Securities, LLC, or our Dealer Manager.  During our organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions and dealer manager fees and payments to our Prior Advisor, or its affiliates, as applicable, for reimbursement of certain organization and offering costs.  Total selling commissions, dealer manager fees and reimbursable organization and offering expenses through the completion of our Total Primary Offering were, in the aggregate, 10.7% of total proceeds raised from our Total Primary Offering, below the 15.0% maximum allowed.  We expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, as applicable, in connection with the selection and origination or acquisition of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us.  On June 30, 2014, we entered into a new advisory agreement with our Advisor, on terms substantially similar to those set forth in our prior advisory agreement with our Prior Advisor, which has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our Advisor and our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors.

Cash Flows 
  The following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   September 30, 2015 
  Operating Activities 
  Our cash flows from operating activities depends on numerous factors including the changes to net interest income and net operating income generated from our real estate investments, distributions from PE Investments, fees paid to our Advisor for the management of our investments, transaction costs on new investments, and general and administrative expenses.  Our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by   $24.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of lower invested assets generating lower net interest income and equity in earnings period over period. 
  Investing Activities 
  Our cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund debt investment originations and investment acquisitions, net of proceeds received from dispositions or repayments of real estate assets.  Our net cash provided by investing activities decreased by $  60.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Cash flows provided by investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily a result of CRE debt investment repayments, proceeds from sale of an unconsolidated venture, and distributions from PE Investments, offset by CRE debt investment originations, CMBS purchases, and acquisition of operating real estate.  Cash flows provided by investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily a result of CRE debt investment repayments and distributions from PE Investments, offset by CRE debt investment originations. 
  Financing Activities 
  Our cash flows from financing activities are principally impacted by our distributions paid on common stock, borrowings on credit facilities, and mortgage notes payable, net.  Our net cash used in financing activities decreased by $  56.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of increased borrowings from our mortgage notes and lower repayments of securitization bonds, partially offset by increased share repurchases. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have certain arrangements which do not meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements, but do have some of the characteristics of off-balance sheet arrangements.  We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures.  Refer to Note 5.  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures  in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements.  In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment. 
   
  Related Party Arrangements 
  Advisor 
  In connection with the completion of NorthStar Realty s spin-off of its asset management business into our Sponsor, on June 30, 2014, we entered into a new advisory agreement with our Advisor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the prior advisory agreement, and terminated the advisory agreement with our Prior Advisor.  For periods prior to June 30, 2014, the information below regarding fees and reimbursements incurred and accrued but not yet paid relates to our Prior Advisor.   
  In June 2016, our board of directors approved the renewal of the advisory agreement for an additional one-year term, on terms identical to those previously in effect. 
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, originating, acquiring and asset managing investments on our behalf.  Our Advisor may delegate certain of its  
  
   63 

Table of Contents  

obligations to affiliated entities, which may be organized under the laws of the United States or foreign jurisdictions.  References to our Advisor include our Advisor and any such affiliated entities.  For such services, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, our Advisor receives fees and reimbursement from us.  Below is a description and table of the fees and reimbursements incurred to our Advisor.   
  Fees to Advisor 
  Asset Management Fee 
  Our Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.25% of the sum of the amount funded or allocated for CRE investments, including expenses and any financing attributable to such investments, less any principal received on debt and securities investments (or our proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture).   
  Incentive Fee 
  Our Advisor is entitled to receive distributions equal to   15.0%   of net cash flows of us, whether from continuing operations, repayment of loans, disposition of assets or otherwise, but only after stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their invested capital plus an   8.0%   cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such invested capital.   
  Acquisition Fee 
  Our Advisor also receives fees for providing structuring, diligence, underwriting advice and related services in connection with real estate acquisitions equal to 1.0% of the amount funded or allocated by us to originate or acquire investments, including acquisition costs and any financing attributable to such investments (or our proportionate share thereof in the case of an investment made through a joint venture).  A fee paid to our Advisor in connection with the origination or acquisition of CRE debt investments is included in CRE debt investments, net on our consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  A fee incurred related to an equity investment will generally be expensed as incurred.  A fee paid to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of an equity or debt investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is included in investments in unconsolidated ventures on our consolidated balance sheets.   
  Disposition Fee 
  For substantial assistance in connection with the sale of investments and based on the services provided, as determined by our Company s independent directors, our Advisor receives a disposition fee of 1.0% of the contract sales price of each CRE investment sold.  We do not pay a disposition fee upon the maturity, prepayment, workout, modification or extension of a CRE debt investment unless there is a corresponding fee paid by our borrower, in which case the disposition fee is the lesser of: (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of the CRE debt investment prior to such transaction; or (ii) the amount of the fee paid by our borrower in connection with such transaction.  If we take ownership of a property as a result of a workout or foreclosure of a CRE debt investment, we will pay a disposition fee upon the sale of such property.  A disposition fee from the sale of an investment is generally expensed and included in asset management and other fees - related party in our consolidated statements of operations.  A disposition fee for a CRE debt investment incurred in a transaction other than a sale is included in CRE debt investments, net on our consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.   
  Reimbursements to Advisor 
  Operating Costs 
  Our Advisor is entitled to receive reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs incurred by our Advisor in connection with administrative services provided to us.  Our Advisor allocates, in good faith, indirect costs to us related to our Advisor s and its affiliates  employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the advisory agreement with our Advisor.  The indirect costs include our allocable share of our Advisor s compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs.  The indirect costs also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses.  However, there is no reimbursement for personnel costs related to executive officers (although there may be reimbursement for certain executive officers of our Advisor) and other personnel involved in activities for which our Advisor receives an acquisition fee or a disposition fee.  Our Advisor allocates these costs to us relative to its and its affiliates  other managed companies in good faith and has reviewed the allocation with our board of directors, including its independent directors.  Our Advisor updates the board of directors on a quarterly basis of any material changes to the expense allocation and provides a detailed review to the board of directors, at least annually, and as otherwise requested by the board of directors.  We reimburse our Advisor quarterly for operating costs (including the asset management fee) based on a calculation for the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of our average invested assets; or (ii) 25.0% of our net income determined without reduction  
  
   64 

Table of Contents  

for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period.  Notwithstanding the above, we may reimburse our Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.  We calculate the expense reimbursement quarterly based upon the trailing twelve-month period.   
  Summary of Fees and Reimbursements 
  The following table presents the fees and reimbursements incurred to our Advisor for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the amount due to related party as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

______________________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. 
              (2) 
    Acquisition/disposition fees incurred to our Advisor related to CRE debt investments are generally offset by origination/exit fees paid to us by borrowers if such fees are required from the borrower.  Acquisition fees related to equity investments are included in asset management and other fees - related party in our consolidated statements of operations.  Acquisition fees related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are included in investments in unconsolidated ventures on our consolidated balance sheets.  Our Advisor may determine to defer fees or seek reimbursement.  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , our Advisor waived   $0.8 million   of acquisition fees and   $0.4 million   of disposition fees related to CRE securities. 
              (3) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , our Advisor has incurred unreimbursed operating costs on our behalf of   $6.7 million   that remain eligible to allocate to us. 
     Securitization 2013-1 
  In August 2013, we closed Securitization 2013-1.  We initially contributed eight CRE debt investments with a $346.1 million aggregate principal amount.  NorthStar Realty contributed three senior loans with an aggregate principal amount of $79.1 million at cost to Securitization 2013-1.  An affiliate of our Sponsor was named special servicer of Securitization 2013-1.   
  PE Investments 
  In connection with PE Investments, we guaranteed all of our funding obligations that may be due and owed under the governing documents indirectly through an indemnification agreement with NorthStar Realty, which in turn guaranteed the obligations directly to the PE Investment entities.  We and NorthStar Realty each agreed to indemnify the other proportionately for any losses that may arise in connection with the funding and other obligations as set forth in the governing documents in the case of a joint default by us and NorthStar Realty.  We and NorthStar Realty further agreed to indemnify each other for all of the losses that may arise as a result of a default that was solely caused by us or NorthStar Realty, as the case may be.   
  PE Investment I 
  In connection with PE Investment I, we assumed the rights to subscribe to   29.5%   of PE Investment I from NorthStar Realty.  We and NorthStar Realty contributed cash of   $400.1 million  , of which we and NorthStar Realty contributed   $118.0 million   and   $282.1 million  , respectively. 
  PE Investment IIB 
  In February 2016, our board of directors, including all of our independent directors, approved the purchase of an additional 14.0% of the PE Investment IIA transaction from a company managed by our Sponsor, NorthStar Realty, or PE Investment IIB.  We  
  
   65 

Table of Contents  

purchased PE Investment IIB on the same terms and conditions negotiated by another existing and purchasing co-investor in the transaction.  This increased our total ownership from 15% to 29%.  We acquired PE Investment IIB for $26.5 million based on a NAV of $660.6 million as of   September 30, 2015  , adjusted for distributions and contributions.  With this add-on investment, we are responsible for 29% of the Deferred Amount, or   $85.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

  From October 1, 2016 through   November 4, 2016  , we issued   0.7 million   shares of common stock pursuant to our DRP, raising proceeds of   $7.1 million  .  As of   November 4, 2016  ,   10.0 million   shares were available to be issued pursuant to our DRP.   
  Distributions 
  On   November 9, 2016  , our board of directors approved a daily cash distribution of   $0.001917808   per share of common stock for each of the   three months ended   March 31, 2017.  Distributions are generally paid to stockholders on the first business day of the month following the month for which the distribution was accrued.   
  Share Repurchases 
  From October 1, 2016 through   November 4, 2016  , we repurchased   1.3 million   shares for a total of   $12.4 million   or a weighted average price of   $9.49   per share under a share repurchase program, or our Share Repurchase Program, that enables stockholders to sell their shares to us in certain circumstances, including death or a qualifying disability.  We fund repurchase requests received during a quarter with proceeds set aside for that purpose which are not expected to exceed proceeds received from our DRP.   
  New Investments 
  Commercial Real Estate Debt 
  In October 2016, we upsized our future funding commitments by $17.0 million on a CRE debt investment. 
  Real Estate Securities Investments 
  In October 2016, we purchased a CMBS with a face value of $10.0 million at a discount of $3.2 million. 
  Repayments 
  Commercial Real Estate Debt 
  In October 2016, we received $97.6 million related to the repayment of a CRE debt investment. 
  Securitization 2016-1 
  In November 2016, we bifurcated three first mortgage loans with an aggregate principal amount of $44.4 million into senior loans of $29.5 million and subordinate mortgage interests of $14.9 million to facilitate the financing of the senior loans into Securitization 2016-1, a securitization financing transaction entered into by NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. ( NorthStar Income II ), a company managed by an affiliate of the Sponsor.  We transferred the three senior loans at cost to Securitization 2016-1.  We did not retain any interest in the senior loans and retained the subordinate mortgage interests on an unleveraged basis.  We will use the proceeds to, among other things, repay borrowings on its term loan facilities. 
   
  Inflation 
  Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature.  As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does.  A change in interest rates may correlate with the inflation rate.  Substantially all of the leases at our multifamily and student housing properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures.  Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our multifamily and student housing properties.

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  We believe that FFO and MFFO, both of which are non-GAAP measures, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and of us in particular.  We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National  
  
   66 

Table of Contents  

Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable property, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciable property owned directly or indirectly and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.   
  Changes in the accounting and reporting rules under U.S. GAAP that have been put into effect since the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in the non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO.  For instance, the accounting treatment for acquisition fees related to business combinations has changed from being capitalized to being expensed.  Additionally, publicly registered, non-traded REITs are typically different from traded REITs because they generally have a limited life followed by a liquidity event or other targeted exit strategy.  Non-traded REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation as compared to later years when the proceeds from their initial public offering have been fully invested and when they may seek to implement a liquidity event or other exit strategy.  However, we continue to make investments past the acquisition and development stage, albeit at a substantially lower pace.   
  Acquisition fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the origination and acquisition of debt investments are amortized over the life of the investment as an adjustment to interest income under U.S. GAAP and are therefore included in the computation of net income (loss) and income (loss) before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures and income tax benefit (expense), both of which are performance measures under U.S. GAAP.  We adjust MFFO for the amortization of acquisition fees in the period when such amortization is recognized under U.S. GAAP.  Acquisition     fees are paid in cash that would otherwise be available to distribute to our stockholders.  We believe that acquisition fees incurred by us negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which such investments are originated or acquired by reducing cash flow and therefore the potential distributions to our stockholders.  However, in general, we earn origination fees for debt investments from our borrowers in an amount equal to the acquisition fees paid to our Advisor, and as a result, the impact of acquisition fees to our operating performance and cash flow would be minimal.   
  Acquisition fees and expenses paid to our Advisor and third parties in connection with the acquisition of equity investments are generally considered expenses and are included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures and income tax benefit (expense), both of which are performance measures under U.S. GAAP.  Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operating earnings, cash flow or net proceeds from the sale of investments or properties.  All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on future distributions to stockholders and cash flow generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.   
  The origination and acquisition of debt investments and the corresponding acquisition fees paid to our Advisor (and any offsetting origination fees received from our borrowers) associated with such activity is a key operating feature of our business plan that results in generating income and cash flow in order to make distributions to our stockholders.  Therefore, the exclusion for acquisition fees may be of limited value in calculating operating performance because acquisition fees affect our overall long-term operating performance and may be recurring in nature as part of net income (loss) and income (loss) before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures and income tax benefit (expense) over our life.   
  Due to certain of the unique features of publicly-registered, non-traded REITs, the Investment Program Association, or the IPA, an industry trade group, standardized a performance measure known as MFFO and recommends the use of MFFO for such REITs.  Management believes MFFO is a useful performance measure to evaluate our business and further believes it is important to disclose MFFO in order to be consistent with the IPA recommendation and other non-traded REITs.  MFFO that adjusts for items such as acquisition fees would only be comparable to non-traded REITs that have completed the majority of their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics as us.  Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has approved the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate MFFO.  In the future, the SEC or another regulatory body may decide to standardize permitted adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we may need to adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.  
  MFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate our future operating performance once our organization and offering and acquisition and development stages are complete and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure.  Although management uses the MFFO metric to evaluate future operating performance, this metric excludes certain key operating items and other adjustments that may affect our overall operating performance.  MFFO is not equivalent to net income (loss) as determined under U.S. GAAP.  In addition, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value, or NAV, since an impairment is taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO.   
  
   67 

Table of Contents  

We define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust for certain items, such as accretion of a discount and amortization of a premium on borrowings and related deferred financing costs, as such adjustments are comparable to adjustments for debt investments and will be helpful in assessing our operating performance.  We also adjust MFFO for the non-recurring impact of the non-cash effect of deferred income tax benefits or expenses, as applicable, as such items are not indicative of our operating performance.  Similarly, we adjust for the non-cash effect of unrealized gains or losses on unconsolidated ventures.  Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate MFFO using the same method.  MFFO is calculated using FFO.  FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company s operating performance.  The IPA s definition of MFFO excludes from FFO the following items: 
             
    acquisition fees and expenses; 
                
    non-cash amounts related to straight-line rent and the amortization of above or below market and in-place intangible lease assets and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from an accrual basis of accounting under U.S. GAAP to a cash basis of accounting); 
                
    amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt investments; 
                
    non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments that meet the specified criteria identified in the rules and regulations of the SEC; 
                
    realized gains (losses) from the early extinguishment of debt; 
                
    realized gains (losses) on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivative holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our business; 
                
    unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including CMBS and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed hedges and foreign exchange holdings; 
                
    unrealized gains (losses) from the consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; 
                
    adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; and 
                
    adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis as above. 
     Certain of the above adjustments are also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments. 
  MFFO excludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments.  We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of reserves/impairment on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary.  Significant judgment is required in this analysis.  With respect to debt investments, we consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business.  Fair value is typically estimated based on discounting expected future cash flow of the underlying collateral taking into consideration the discount rate, capitalization rate, occupancy, creditworthiness of major tenants and many other factors.  This requires significant judgment and because it is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date.  If the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for the debt investment is less than its net carrying value, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.  With respect to a real estate investment, a property s value is considered impaired if our estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  The value of our investments may be impaired and their carrying values may not be recoverable due to our limited life.  Investors should note that while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flow and the relatively limited term of a non-traded REIT s anticipated operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flow prior to any liquidity event.   
  We believe that MFFO is a useful non-GAAP measure for non-traded REITs.  It is helpful to management and stockholders in assessing our future operating performance once our organization and offering and acquisition and development stages are complete, because it eliminates from net income non-cash fair value adjustments on our real estate securities and acquisition fees and expenses that are incurred as part of our investment activities.  However, MFFO may not be a useful measure of our operating performance or as a comparable measure to other typical non-traded REITs if we do not continue to operate in a similar manner to other non-traded REITs, including if we were to extend our acquisition and development stage or if we determined not to pursue an exit strategy.

However, MFFO does have certain limitations.  For instance, the effect of any amortization or accretion on debt investments originated or acquired at a premium or discount, respectively, is not reported in MFFO.  In addition, realized gains (losses) from acquisitions and dispositions and other adjustments listed above are not reported in MFFO, even though such realized gains (losses) and other adjustments could affect our operating performance and cash available for distribution.  Stockholders should note that any cash gains generated from the sale of investments would generally be used to fund new investments.  Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments may be based on many factors, including current operational or individual property issues or general market or overall industry conditions.   
  We typically purchase CMBS at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income (the  CMBS effective yield ).  We believe that reporting the CMBS effective yield in MFFO provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows and is more consistent with our review of operating performance. 
  Neither FFO nor MFFO is equivalent to net income (loss) or cash flow provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the U.S. GAAP methodology in evaluating our operating performance.  Neither FFO nor MFFO is necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  FFO and MFFO do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties.  Furthermore, neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO and MFFO attributable to common stockholders (dollars in thousands):

  Distributions Declared and Paid 
  We generally pay distributions on a monthly basis based on daily record dates.  Based on our estimated net asset value per share of   $9.87  , our annualized distribution amount represents an effective current yield of   8.1%  .  From the commencement of our operations on October 18, 2010 through   September 30, 2016  , we paid distributions at an annualized distribution rate of $0.80 per share of our common stock.  Distributions are generally paid to stockholders on the first business day of the month following the month for which the distribution has accrued.

The following table presents distributions declared for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the   year ended December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

           (1) 
    Represents distributions declared for such period, even though such distributions are actually paid to stockholders the month following such period. 
              (2) 
    From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we declared distributions of   $374.6 million  , of which   77%   was paid from FFO,   22%   was paid from Offering proceeds and   1%   was paid from distribution support proceeds.  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , the difference between total distributions paid (including cash distributions and shares issued in connection with our DRP) and cash flow provided by operations was   $60.0 million  , of which   $4.6 million   related to shares purchased by NorthStar Realty pursuant to our Distribution Support Agreement, which terminated in July 2013, and the remainder related to shares issued pursuant to our DRP. 
     Distributions in excess of our cash flow provided by operations were paid using Offering proceeds.  Over the long-term, we expect that our distributions will be paid entirely from cash flow provided by operations.  However, our operating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including our ability to raise and invest capital at favorable yields, the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment, the type and mix of our investments and accounting of our investments in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Future distributions declared and paid may exceed cash flow provided by operations. 
  As of   November 4, 2016  , our portfolio is generating a   12.3%   current yield on invested equity before expenses and excluding uninvested cash.  There is no assurance we will realize the expected returns on invested equity over the term of these investments.  Our actual return on invested equity could vary significantly from our expectations. 
   
  Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are primarily subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.  These risks are dependent on various factors beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions and political considerations.  Our market risk sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative positions are held for investment and not for trading purposes.   
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We may be subject to interest rate changes as a result of long-term borrowings used to acquire real estate equity investments and may also be exposed to changes in net interest income of our real estate debt investments, which is the difference between the income earned and the interest expense incurred in connection with our borrowings and derivatives.   
  Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs by borrowing primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and by evaluating hedging opportunities.   
  Our CRE debt and securities investments bear interest at either a floating or fixed-rate.  The interest rate on our floating-rate assets is a fixed spread over an index such as LIBOR and typically reprices every 30 days based on LIBOR in effect at the time.  Currently, most of our floating-rate CRE debt investments have a fixed minimum LIBOR floor.  We will not benefit from an increase in LIBOR until it is in excess of the LIBOR floors.  Given the frequent and periodic repricing of our floating-rate assets, changes in benchmark interest rates are unlikely to materially affect the value of our floating-rate portfolio.  Changes in short-term rates will, however, affect income from our investments.   
  
   70 

Table of Contents  

A change in interest rates could affect the value of our fixed-rate CRE debt and securities investments.  For instance, an increase in interest rates would result in a higher required yield on investments, which would decrease the value on existing fixed-rate investments in order to adjust their yields to current market levels.   
  Our general financing strategy has focused on the use of  match-funded  structures.  This means that we seek to align the maturities of our liabilities with the maturities on our assets as closely as possible in order to manage the risks of being forced to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets.  In addition, we seek to match the interest rate on our assets with like-kind borrowings, so fixed-rate investments are financed with fixed-rate borrowings and floating-rate assets are financed with floating-rate borrowings, directly or indirectly, through the use of interest rate swaps, caps and other financial instruments or through a combination of these strategies.  We are subject to interest rate risk because on certain investments, we maintain a net floating-rate asset position, and, therefore, our income will increase with increases in interest rates and decrease with declines in interest rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   78.5%   of our debt investments were floating rate investments and   59.1%   of our total borrowings were floating rate liabilities.  Of the floating rate liabilities,   2.3%   related to the use of our CMBS facilities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , most of our floating-rate investments had LIBOR floors below the current LIBOR rate and our CRE securities were fixed rate, so a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates (including the effect of the interest rate floor) would increase income by   $3.7 million   annually. 
  Credit Spread Risk 
  The value of our fixed and floating-rate investments also changes with market credit spreads.  This means that when market-demanded risk premium, or credit spread, increases, the value of our fixed and floating-rate assets decrease and vice versa.  Fixed-rate assets are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed-rate U.S. Treasury of like maturity.  This means that their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such assets by the market, based on their credit relative to U.S. Treasuries.  The floating-rate CRE debt and securities investments are valued based on a market credit spread over the applicable LIBOR.  Demand for a higher yield on investments results in higher or  wider  spread over the benchmark rate (usually the applicable U.S. Treasury yield) to value these assets.  Under these conditions, the value of our portfolio should decrease.  Conversely, if the spread used to value these assets were to decrease or  tighten,  the value of these assets should increase.   
  Credit Risk 
  Credit risk in our CRE debt and securities investments relates to each individual borrower s ability to make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates.  We seek to manage credit risk through our Advisor s comprehensive credit analysis prior to making an investment, actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality, including subordination and diversification of our portfolio.  Our analysis is based on a broad range of real estate, financial, economic and borrower-related factors which we believe are critical to the evaluation of credit risk inherent in a transaction.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   two   CRE debt investment contributed more than   10%   of interest income.   
  We are subject to the credit risk of the borrower when we make CRE debt and securities investments and the credit risk of our tenants in our real estate properties.  We seek to undertake a rigorous credit evaluation of each borrower/tenant prior to making an investment.  This analysis includes an extensive due diligence investigation of the borrowers/tenant s creditworthiness and business as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the underlying real estate to the borrowers/tenant s core business operations.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management conducted an evaluation, as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).   
  Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports.   
  Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
  Except as set forth below, there have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  We acquired a portfolio of 23 light industrial assets during the first quarter 2016 and a portfolio of two multi-tenant office buildings through deed in lieu of foreclosure during the second quarter 2016.  SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business  internal control over financial reporting from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition.  We are in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of the acquired portfolios and, accordingly, we have not assessed the portfolios  internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  .

PART II.    Other Information 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
  We may be involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of our business.  Although we are unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, any current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.   
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016 except as noted below. 
  We have paid and may continue to pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow provided by operations, and as a result we will have less cash available for investments and stockholders  overall return may be reduced. 
  Our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from any source, including Offering proceeds, borrowings, our Advisor s agreement to defer, reduce or waive fees (or accept, in lieu of cash, shares of our common stock) or sales of assets or we may make distributions in the form of taxable stock dividends.  We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use to fund distributions.  We have funded our cash distributions paid to date using net proceeds from our Offering, including our DRP, and we may do so in the future.  During the course of our existence, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund distributions and, as a result, distributions declared may be paid using proceeds from our DRP.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we declared distributions of   $72.4 million   compared to cash provided by operating activities of   $47.3 million   with $  29.1 million  , or   40%  , of the distributions declared during this period being paid using proceeds from our DRP.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we declared distributions of   $95.7 million   compared to cash provided by operating activities of   $85.0 million   with   $26.7 million  , or 28%, of the distributions declared during this period being paid using proceeds from our DRP. 
   
  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
  We adopted our Share Repurchase Program effective July 19, 2010 and as amended on June 25, 2015, which enables stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances.  We may not repurchase shares unless a stockholder has held shares for one year.  However, we may repurchase shares held for less than one year in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability.  We will repurchase shares within two years of such death or qualifying disability of a stockholder at the higher of the price paid for the shares, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations or any similar transaction with respect to the shares of common stock, or our estimated value per share.  A qualifying disability is a disability as such term is defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code that arises after the purchase of the shares requested to be repurchased.  We are not obligated to repurchase shares under our Share Repurchase Program.  Except in the case of death or qualifying disability (as described above), the price paid for shares redeemed under the Share Repurchase Program for requests received after January 1, 2015 is 95% of the most recently disclosed estimated value per share.  
  We fund repurchase requests received during a quarter with proceeds set aside for that purpose which are not expected to exceed proceeds received from our DRP.  However, to the extent that the aggregate DRP proceeds are not sufficient to fund repurchase requests, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, choose to use other sources of funds.  Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, provided that any amendment that adversely affects the rights or obligations of a participant will take effect upon   10   days  prior written notice (or   10   business days  prior written notice if related to a change in the number of shares that can be repurchased in a calendar year).  In addition, our Share Repurchase Program will terminate in the event a secondary market develops for our shares or until our shares are listed on a national securities exchange or included for quotation in a national securities market.

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased shares of our common stock as follows: 

__________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Subject to funds being available, we will limit the number of shares redeemed pursuant to our Share Repurchase Program to: (i) 5.0% of the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year; and (ii) those that could be funded from the net DRP proceeds in the prior calendar year plus such additional funds as may be reserved for that purpose by our board of directors; provided, however, that the above volume limitations shall not apply to repurchases requested within two years after the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder.   
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   unfulfilled repurchase requests. 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  All prior sales of unregistered securities have been previously reported on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

  (b)   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

  (a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
  (b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
