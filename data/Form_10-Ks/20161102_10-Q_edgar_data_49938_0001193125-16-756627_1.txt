stations to a branded wholesaler operating model for approximately $2.8 billion. Under the branded wholesaler model, Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties who own and/or operate the sites in alignment with Esso brand standards. The
company s gain on sale, which is subject to final closing adjustments, is anticipated to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion ($1.7 billion to $1.8 billion after tax).  
 During the third quarter, the company completed the sale of a number of sites in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and

   12. Recently issued accounting standards   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The standard establishes a single
revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. The standard will be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. Imperial continues to evaluate the standard and its
effect on the company s financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard,  Leases . The standard requires all leases with an
initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019. Imperial is evaluating the standard and its effect on the company s financial
statements.    Effective September 30, 2016, Imperial early adopted  Accounting Standards Update (ASU) no. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740) :  Balance sheet
classification of deferred taxes , on a prospective basis. This update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and non-current, and instead requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be
classified as non-current.    The balance sheet classification of deferred income tax asset / (liability) is shown below.

Item 2.  
  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations        Operating results
     Third quarter 2016 vs. third quarter 2015     The company s net
income for the third quarter of 2016 was $1,003 million or $1.18 per-share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of $479 million or $0.56 per-share for the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results included a $716 million ($0.84
per-share) gain from the sale of retail sites.    Upstream recorded a net loss in the third quarter of $26 million, compared to a net loss of $52 million in the same
period of 2015. Results in the third quarter of 2016 mainly reflect the impact of higher Syncrude volumes of about $90 million and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower realizations of about $90 million.  
 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) averaged US$44.94 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016, down from US$46.57 per barrel in the same quarter of 2015. Western Canada
Select (WCS) averaged US$31.43 per barrel and US$33.38 per barrel respectively for the same periods. The WTI / WCS differential widened to 30 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 28 percent in the same period of 2015.  
 The Canadian dollar averaged US$0.77 in the third quarter of 2016 and was essentially unchanged versus the same period of 2015.  
 Imperial s average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen and synthetic crudes declined essentially in line with the North American benchmarks, adjusted for
changes in the exchange rate and transportation costs. Bitumen realizations averaged $30.16 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.45 per barrel versus the third quarter of 2015. Synthetic crude realizations averaged $58.97 per
barrel, a decrease of $2.24 per barrel for the same period of 2015.   Gross production of Cold Lake bitumen averaged 157,000 barrels per day in the third quarter,
compared to 166,000 barrels in the same period last year. The lower production was mainly due to the timing of steam cycles.   Gross production of Kearl bitumen
averaged 159,000 barrels per day in the third quarter (113,000 barrels Imperial s share) compared to 181,000 barrels per day (128,000 barrels Imperial s share) during the third quarter of 2015. Lower production was the result of planned
and unplanned maintenance activities.    The company s share of gross production from Syncrude averaged 85,000 barrels per day, up from 59,000 barrels in the
third quarter of 2015. Increased production reflects ongoing efforts to improve the reliability of operations.    Downstream net income was $1,002 million in the
third quarter, compared to $454 million in the same period of 2015. Earnings increased mainly due to a gain of $716 million from the sale of retail sites, improved refinery operations of $80 million and higher marketing sales volumes of $50 million,
partially offset by lower industry margins of about $300 million.    Refinery throughput averaged 407,000 barrels per day, up from 390,000 barrels in the third
quarter of 2015. Increased throughput reflects lower maintenance activities than in the same period of 2015.    Petroleum product sales were 505,000 barrels per day,
up from 495,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2015, with growth concentrated in the higher value commercial and retail channels.    Chemical net income was
$56 million in the third quarter, compared to $78 million in the same quarter of 2015.

  Net income effects from Corporate and Other were negative $29 million in the third quarter, compared to negative $1
million in the same period of 2015.     Nine months 2016 vs. nine months 2015   
 Net income in the first nine months of 2016 was $721 million, or $0.85 per-share on a diluted basis, including a gain of $719 million ($0.85 per-share) from the sale of
retail sites, versus net income of $1,020 million or $1.20 per-share for the first nine months of 2015.    Upstream recorded a net loss of $764 million for the first
nine months of 2016, compared to a net loss of $415 million for the same period last year. The loss in 2016 reflected lower realizations of about $970 million, the impact of the northern Alberta wildfires of about $155 million and higher
depreciation expense of about $90 million. These factors were partially offset by higher volumes of about $230 million, the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar of about $130 million, the favourable impact of lower royalties of about $90 million and
lower energy cost of about $60 million. Earnings in 2015 reflected the impact associated with the Alberta corporate income tax rate increase of about $327 million.  
 West Texas Intermediate averaged US$41.54 per barrel in the first nine months of 2016, down from US$51.03 per barrel in the same period last year. Western Canada Select
averaged US$27.74 per barrel and US$37.89 per barrel respectively for the same periods. The WTI/WCS differential widened to 33 percent in the first nine months of 2016, up from 26 percent in the same period of 2015.  
 During the first nine months of 2016, the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar versus the same period of 2015. The Canadian dollar averaged US$0.76 in
the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of almost US$0.04 from the same period of 2015.    Imperial s average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen and
synthetic crudes declined essentially in line with the North American benchmarks, adjusted for changes in the exchange rate and transportation costs. Bitumen realizations averaged $23.77 (US$18.18) for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of
$12.71 per barrel versus the same period of 2015. Synthetic crude realizations averaged $53.45 (US$40.33) per barrel, a decrease of $9.58 per barrel for the same period of 2015.  
 Gross production of Cold Lake bitumen averaged 162,000 barrels per day in the first nine months, up from 160,000 barrels from the same period last year. Production from
the expansion project offset the impacts from cycle timing.    Gross production of Kearl bitumen averaged 169,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2016
(120,000 barrels Imperial s share) compared to 136,000 barrels per day (96,000 barrels Imperial s share) for the same period of 2015. The increase was the result of start-up of the expansion project and improved reliability of the initial
development.    During the first nine months of 2016, the company s share of gross production from Syncrude averaged 61,000 barrels per day, consistent with the
same period of 2015.    Downstream net income was $1,393 million, up from $1,234 million from the same period of 2015. Earnings increased mainly due to a gain of $719
million from the sale of retail sites, the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar of about $130 million, higher marketing sales volumes of $70 million and lower fuels marketing operating costs of about $50 million, partially offset by lower downstream
margins of about $780 million.    Refinery throughput averaged 351,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2016, compared to 385,000 barrels in the same
period of 2015. Capacity utilization decreased to 83 percent from 92 percent in the same period of 2015, reflecting the more significant scope of turnaround maintenance activity in the current year.  
 Petroleum product sales were 481,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2016, compared to 482,000 barrels per day in the same period of 2015.  
 Chemical net income was $160 million, compared to $213 million in the same period of 2015.

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED    
           
  For the first nine months of 2016, net income effects from Corporate and Other were negative $68 million, versus
negative $12 million in 2015, primarily due to lower capitalized interest and the absence of the impact from the Alberta tax rate increase in 2015.     Liquidity
and capital resources     Cash flow generated from operating activities was $772 million in the third quarter, compared with $1,104 million in the corresponding
period in 2015, reflecting lower earnings, excluding the gain on the sale of retail sites.    Investing activities generated net cash of $1,005 million in the third
quarter, compared with cash used in investing activities of $619 million in the same period of 2015, reflecting proceeds from asset sales in 2016 and the completion of major upstream growth projects.  
 Cash used in financing activities was $1,724 million in the third quarter, compared with $147 million in the third quarter of 2015. Cash from operating activities and
proceeds from asset sales were mainly used in the third quarter of 2016 to reduce outstanding short-term debt. Dividends paid in the third quarter of 2016 were $127 million. The per-share dividend paid in the third quarter was $0.15, up from $0.13
in the same period of 2015.    The company s cash balance was $248 million at September 30, 2016, versus $366 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
   Cash flow generated from operating activities was $1,264 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared with $1,762 million in the same period of 2015,
reflecting lower earnings, excluding the gain on retail sites.    Investing activities generated net cash of $350 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared
with cash used in investing activities of $2,345 million in the same period of 2015, reflecting proceeds from asset sales and the completion of major upstream growth projects.  
 Cash used in financing activities was $1,569 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $734 million in the same
period of 2015. Cash from operating activities and proceeds from the asset sales were used to reduce outstanding short-term debt. Dividends paid in the first nine months of 2016 were $364 million. The per-share dividend paid in the first nine months
was $0.43, up from $0.39 in the same period of 2015.     Oil and gas reserves   
 As disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K, low crude and natural gas prices can impact Imperial s reserves as reported under the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC)
rules. Average year-to-date crude prices have been significantly affected by the very low prices experienced during the first quarter of 2016, but have recovered considerably since that time. If the average prices seen during the first nine months
of 2016 persist for the remainder of the year, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil, such as those associated with all or part of the oil sands operations at Kearl and Cold Lake will not qualify as proved reserves
at year-end 2016. Quantities that could be required to be de-booked as proved reserves on an SEC basis amount to approximately 2.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and approximately 0.4 billion barrels at Cold Lake, and will be determined once
the price and costs have been finalized at year-end. Among the factors that would result in these reserves being re-booked as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or
operating efficiencies. Under the terms of government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to Imperial. The company does not expect the de-booking of reported proved reserves under the SEC definitions to
affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future production volumes.

   Impact of oil and gas reserves and prices and margins on testing for impairment   
 In light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, and as part of Imperial s annual planning and budgeting process which is currently
in progress, the company will perform an assessment of its major long-lived assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in late 2015. The assessment reflects crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate
investment opportunities and generally consistent with the long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry and government experts. Development of future undiscounted cash flow estimates requires significant management judgement,
particularly in cases where an asset s life is expected to extend decades into the future. An asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the asset s carrying value, and impairment would be
measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Imperial will complete its asset recoverability assessment and analyze the conclusions of that assessment in connection with the preparation and review of the company s
year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2016 Form 10-K. Until these activities are complete, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of potential future impairments related to the company s long-lived
assets.     Recently issued accounting standards     In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements
and expands disclosure requirements. The standard will be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. Imperial continues to evaluate the standard and its effect on the company s financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard,  Leases . The standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019. Imperial is evaluating the standard and its effect on the company s financial statements.  
 Effective September 30, 2016, Imperial early adopted  Accounting Standards Update (ASU) no. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740) :  Balance sheet classification of
deferred taxes , on a prospective basis. This update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and non-current, and instead requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as
non-current.    The balance sheet classification of deferred income tax asset / (liability) is shown below.  
   
    Forward-looking statements     Statements in
this report regarding future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future financial and operating results could differ materially due to the impact of market conditions, changes in law or governmental policy, changes in
operating conditions and costs, changes in project schedules, operating performance, demand for oil and gas, commercial negotiations or other technical and economic factors.

     Item 3.  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   
 Information about market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, does not differ materially from that discussed on page 22 of the company s annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and  Form 10-Q  for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  
 Reference is made to Item 2. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, sections entitled Oil and gas reserves and
Impact of oil and gas reserves and prices and margins on testing for impairment, for discussion on the risks associated with the current pricing environment.      
 Item 4.  Controls and procedures     As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the company s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have evaluated the company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for
timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and
forms.   There has not been any change in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company s internal control over financial reporting.
