EAGLE MOUNTAIN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1       Organization, Principal Activities and Basis of Presentation 

Eagle Mountain Corporation ( Eagle ) (formerly known as USmart Mobile Device Inc. ( USmart )) and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively and on a consolidated basis as the  Company  or  we ,  us  or  our  or similar terminology. 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 17, 2002 and was previously known as ACL Semiconductors Inc. The Company acquired Atlantic Components Limited, a Hong Kong incorporated company ( Atlantic ) through a reverse-acquisition that was effective September 30, 2003. On September 28, 2012, the Company acquired Jussey Investments Limited, a company incorporated in British Virgin Islands ( Jussey ). The subsidiaries were held for disposal since March 31, 2014 and officially disposed on September 30, 2014, the Company disposed all of the equity interest held in ACL International Holdings Limited ( ACL Holdings ). 

After the disposal, the Company was still engaged in the sales and distribution of smartphones, electronic products and components in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( Hong Kong ) and the People s Republic of China ( China  or the  PRC ). 

On April 24, 2015, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate name to Eagle Mountain Corporation.  Subsequently, on June 5, 2015  the Company and Eagle Mountain Ltd., a Belize corporation (the  Assignor ), entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the  Assumption Agreement ), pursuant to which the Assignor assigned to the Company certain debts and assets, including  (1) a controlling interest in Shale Oil International Inc. (OTC:PINK-SHLE), and its 100% owned subsidiary, Texas Shale Oil Inc., which collectively own a strategic oil and gas model (intellectual property) covering  several thousand square miles of prospective oil and gas exploration and development acres in Louisiana, Texas and Mexico, as well as various related geophysical, geological, engineering and geochemical data sets;  (2) an opportunity to participate in and finance a trans-oil pipeline project, and (3) an agreement for a strategic cooperation regarding an integrated energy project and an opportunity to purchase and refurbish a refinery. Mr. Ehud Amir, the Chairman of the Board of the Company s Board of Directors, and the Company s Chief Operating Officer, is the CEO of Assignor.  Mr. Amir is also a co-founder of Texas Shale Oil Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company s 85.39% controlled subsidiary, Shale Oil International Inc. In addition, Mr. Ronald Cormick, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, is the President and Director of Texas Shale Oil Inc. and President and CEO of Shale Oil International Inc.  Mr. Larry Eastland, a member of the Company s Board of Directors, is also director and Chairman of Shale Oil International Inc. 

As a result of entering into the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Company changed its business focus and discontinued its operation in the sales and distribution of smartphones, electronic products and components. The Company now operates in the natural resources, EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) and oil   gas sector. 

On July 17, 2015 the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the increase in authorized shares of common stock and a reverse stock split. Upon filing of the Certificate of Amendment, the Company s authorized common stock was increased to 500,000,000 shares and every eighteen shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock was automatically converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share. The reverse stock split was applied to all shares of the Company s common stock outstanding immediately prior to July 17, 2015, as well as the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Company s equity incentive plans. In addition, the reverse stock split will effect a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of preferred stock or upon the exercise of stock options or warrants outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share had their factional shares rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Note 1       Organization, Principal Activities and Basis of Presentation (continued) 

The aforementioned Assumption Agreement resulted in a change of control in the Company under the terms of the certificates of designation for each of the Series B, C and D preferred stock, each series automatically converted into shares of the Company s common stock upon the amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation becoming effective as set out above.  As a result, the holders of 638,509 shares of Class D and 2,050,000 shares of Class C preferred stock, converted those shares into 268,850,900 shares of our common stock effective July 17, 2015.  These shares were issued on August 24, 2015. The holder of 8,000,000 shares of Class B preferred stock surrendered 40,000,000 shares of common stock upon conversion, which shares were exchanged for 8,000,000 shares of Series E preferred stock.

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, and may not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These unaudited, consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Principal of Consolidation 

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eagle Mountain Corp. and its 85.39% controlled subsidiary,  Shale Oil International Inc. (OTC: PINK-SHLE), as well as Shale Oil International s 100% owned subsidiary, Texas Shale Oil Inc.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Estimates 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the years then ended.  Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation, derivative liabilities, debt discounts and common stock issued for assets, services or in settlement of obligations.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of reporting within the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents 

Accounting for subsidiaries 

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiary acquired of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiary to bring its accounting policies into line with those used by the Company. All intra-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiary are identified separately from the Company s equity therein. Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of original business combination and the minority s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority s share of changes in equity are allocated against the interests of the Company except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. 

Business combinations 

All business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Company s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. At December 31, 2015, we had no recorded goodwill. The interest of minority shareholders in the acquisition is initially measured at the minority s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognized. 

Oil and gas properties 

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under that method: 

a. 

Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred since they do not result in the acquisition of assets. 

b. 

Costs incurred to drill exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells that do not find proved reserves are charged to expense when it is determined that the wells have not found proved reserves. 

c. 

Costs incurred to acquire properties and drill development-type stratigraphic test wells, successful exploratory wells, and successful exploratory-type stratigraphic wells are capitalized. 

d. 

Capitalized costs of wells and related equipment are amortized, depleted, or depreciated using the unit-of-production method. 

e. 

Costs of unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and during the year ended December 31 2015, there was no impairment of long-lived assets. 

Intangible assets  

Identifiable intangible assets are recognized when the Company controls the assets, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.  The economic or useful life of an intangible asset is based on an estimate made by management and is subject to change under certain market conditions.  

Impairment tests were performed as, and update the test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that indicate an impairment might be existed. 

Identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives supported by clearly identifiable cash flows are not subject to regular periodic amortization. Instead, in accordance with ASC subtopic 350-30, general intangibles other than goodwill the carrying amount of the intangible is tested for impairment annually, and again between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant such a test. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Furthermore, amortization of the asset commences when evidence suggests that its useful economic life is no longer deemed indefinite. 

The ASC gives entities the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent) that the asset is impaired. The qualitative assessment test can be performed on some or all of the assets, or the entity can bypass the qualitative test and perform the quantitative test. If it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired, the entity does not have to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test. If it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, the entity must perform the quantitative impairment test and calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. 

If performing the qualitative assessment, the entity needs to identify and consider those events and circumstances that, individually or in the aggregate, most significantly affect an indefinite-lived intangible asset s fair value. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized $507,875 impairment of the intangible asset due to no revenue being recognized to support cash flows. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, payables, and amounts due to related party. The carrying amount of cash, receivables and payables approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of the notes payable approximates fair value as the individual borrowings bear interest at market interest rates.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Stock-based Compensation 

The Company s stock option expenses are recorded in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, and ASC 505, Equity. 

The fair value of the stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The Company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of Company s stock or the expected volatility of similar entities. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest, and there were no estimated forfeitures as the Company has a short history of issuing options. ASC 718-10 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Loss per Common Share 

Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. 

The Company had the following potential common stock equivalents at March 31, 2016: 

Since the Company reported a net loss at March 31, 2016, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents, if outstanding, would have been anti-dilutive.  A separate computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is not presented. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company's revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605 Revenue Recognition (formerly SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104). Revenue is recognized when services are rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.  

Reclassification   

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period s financial statements to conform to the current period s presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

Note 3       Going Concern 

The Company has incurred net losses since a change of business in early 2015, and had a working capital deficit of $2,597,515 at March 31, 2016 and $3,060,658 at December 31, 2015.  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects cash flows from operating activities to improve, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue, although there can be no assurance thereof. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans. 

Note 4      Discontinued Operations 

On June 5, 2015, Eagle Mountain Corporation (the  Company ) executed an assignment and assumption agreement (the  Assumption Agreement ) with Eagle Mountain Ltd., a Belize corporation (the  Assignor ). Pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, the Company acquired certain agreements and assets and assumed debts in the aggregate amount of $1,327,017 from the Assignor.

6% convertible Notes with various investors: 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into various 6% convertible notes with investors, having a maturity date as of September 1, 2015 and with conversion prices varying from $0.05 to $0.10 per share.  We received a total of $1,140,000 in respect of these convertible notes. 

As at the date of issue, these convertible notes were considered to have a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ) because the conversion price was less than the quoted market price at the time of issuance. The beneficial conversion feature resulting from the discounted conversion price compared to market price was valued on the date of issue to be $1,150,000, or the face value of the notes.  This value was recorded as a discount on debt and offset to additional paid in capital. Amortization of the discount for the period ended December 31, 2015 was $1,140,000. 

The notes became due and payable on September 1, 2015 and are now considered demand notes which continue to accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum.  As at March 31, 2016 all the notes issued have been converted to shares of common stock, save 2 original notes with face value of $50,000. 

On August 18, 2015, the Company entered into a 6% convertible note of $250,000, with an investor, having a maturity date as of September 1, 2015 with conversion prices at $0.10 per share. We received a total of $60,000 in respect of the convertible note.

Note 9     Agreement for Services and Stock Options

Note 9     Agreement for Services and Stock Options (continued) 

On January 4, 2016 the Company issued 8,000,000 shares of common stock in respect to the aforementioned option for cash proceeds of $80,000.  There were no options outstanding as at March 31, 2016. 

The Company recognized a consultant fee of $10,721,600 with respect to the issuance during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  On November 17, 2016, the independent consultant who exercised a stock option issued January 4, 2016 under the terms of a services agreement for a total of 8,000,000 shares at 0.01 per share entered into an agreement with the  Company to cancel the shares and return them to treasury. 

Valuation Assumptions 

The Company accounts for share-based payments pursuant to ASC 718,  Stock Compensation  and, accordingly, the Company records compensation expense for share-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company s stock price and expected dividends.  

Stock compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 when options are given for service without further recourse. The Company issued stock options to contractors to provide services to the Company during the fiscal year. However, the stock options have already been granted to the service providers and there is no claw back provision in the options if services are not performed.  Under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 these options were recognized as expense in the period issued because they were given as a form of compensation for services to be rendered with no recourse.  

The following table presents the range of the weighted average fair value of options granted and the related assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock option grants made during the three months ended March 31, 2016: 

a) 

Fair Value : The fair value of the Company's common stock was obtained from the closing price on the OTC Bulletin Board as of the dates of grant. 

b) 

Expected life : The expected term of options granted is determined using the  shortcut  method allowed by SAB No.107. Under this approach, the expected term is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. 

c) 

Risk-free interest rate : The rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options. 

d) 

Volatility:  The expected volatility of the Company s common stock is calculated by using the historical daily volatility of the Company s stock price calculated over a period of time representative of the expected life of the options. 

e) 

Dividend yield : The dividend yield rate is not considered in the model, as the Company has not established a dividend policy for the stock.

Note 9     Agreement for Services and Stock Options (continued) 

Fair value hierarchy of the above assumptions can be categorized as follows: 

(1) 

Level 1 inputs include: 

Fair value of common stock on date of grant- Obtained from the closing price of the Company s common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board as of the date of grant. 

(2) 

Level 2 inputs include: 

Expected volatility- Based on historical volatility of the closing price of the Company s common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. 

Risk-free rate- The risk-free rate of return reflects the interest rate for United States Treasury Note with similar time-to-maturity to that of the options. 

(3) 

Level 3 inputs include: 

Expected lives- The expected lives of options granted were derived from the output of the option valuation model and represented the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

Corporate Overview and Background 

Eagle was primarily engaged in the business of distribution of memory products mainly under  Samsung  brand name which principally comprised DRAM, Graphic RAM and Flash for the Hong Kong and PRC markets ( Samsung Business ). After April 1, 2012, the Samsung Business was transferred to ATMD, a joint venture with Tomen. We indirectly own 30% equity interest in ATMD. On September 27, 2013, we sold the entire 30% equity interest of ATMD. Through the acquisition of Jussey on September 28, 2012, we have diversified our product portfolio and customer network, obtained design and manufacturing capabilities, and tapped into the blooming telecommunication industry with access to the 3G baseband licenses acquired by Jussey s subsidiaries. On September 30, 2014, the Company disposed all of the equity interest held in ACL International Holdings Limited ( ACL Holdings ). 

After the disposal, the Company was still engaged in the sales and distribution of smartphones, electronic products and components in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( Hong Kong ) and the People s Republic of China ( China  or the  PRC ). 

On April 24, 2015, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate name to Eagle Mountain Corporation.  Subsequently, on June 5, 2015  the Company and Eagle Mountain Ltd., a Belize corporation (the  Assignor ), entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the  Assumption Agreement ), pursuant to which the Assignor assigned to the Company certain debts and assets, including  (1)a controlling interest Shale Oil International Inc. (OTC:PINK-SHLE), and its 100% owned subsidiary, Texas Shale Oil Inc., which collectively own a strategic oil and gas model (intellectual property) covering  several thousand square miles of prospective oil and gas exploration and development acres in Louisiana, Texas and Mexico, as well as various related geophysical, geological, engineering and geochemical data sets;  (2) an opportunity to participate in and finance a trans-oil pipeline project, and (3) an agreement for a strategic cooperation regarding an integrated energy project and an opportunity to purchase and refurbish a refinery.  Mr. Ehud Amir, the Chairman of the Board of the Company s Board of Directors, and the Company s Chief Operating Officer, is the CEO of Assignor.  Mr. Amir is also a co-founder of Texas Shale Oil Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company s 85% controlled subsidiary, Shale Oil International Inc. In addition, Mr. Ronald Cormick, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, is the President and Director of Texas Shale Oil Inc. and President and CEO of Shale Oil International Inc.  Mr. Larry Eastland, a member of the Company s Board of Directors, is also director and Chairman of Shale Oil International Inc. 

As a result of the aforementioned transactions the Company now operates in the natural resources, EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) and oil   gas sector, and discontinued its operation in the sales and distribution of smartphones, electronic products and components. 

On July 17, 2015 the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the increase in authorized shares of common stock and a reverse stock split. Upon filing of the Certificate of Amendment, the Company s authorized common stock was increased to 500,000,000 shares and every eighteen shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock was automatically converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share. The reverse stock split was  applied to all shares of the Company s common stock outstanding immediately prior to July 17, 2015, as well as the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Company s equity incentive plans. In addition, the reverse stock split will effect a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of preferred stock or upon the exercise of stock options or warrants outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the reverse stock split. No fractional shares were be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share had their factional shares rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The aforementioned Assumption Agreement resulted in a change of control in the Company under the terms of the certificates of designation for each of the Series B, C and D preferred stock, each series automatically converted into shares of the Company s common stock upon the amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation becoming effective as set out above.  As a result the holders of 638,509 shares of Class D and 2,050,000 shares of Class C preferred stock, converted those shares into 268,850,900 shares of our common stock effective July 17, 2015.  These shares were issued on August 24, 2015. The holder of 8,000,000 shares of Class B preferred stock surrendered 40,000,000 shares of common stock upon conversion, which shares were exchanged for 8,000,000 shares of a newly designated Series E preferred stock. 

On October 23, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series E Preferred Stock ) authorizing the issuance of up to 8,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock. Each share of Series E Preferred Stock has a stated value of $0.001 and is automatically convertible into five shares of the Company s common stock. The conversion ratio is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combination of shares and similar recapitalization transactions. The holders of Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to the Company s stockholders and shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of Series E Preferred Stock are convertible.

During the three months ended March 31, 2016 the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $193,006 as compared to $Nil in the prior comparative period.  General and administrative expenses include travel and entertainment expense, office expense, rent and other overhead, transfer agent and filing fees and fees paid to consultants. 

Other Expenses  

The Company recorded a loss on acquisition of property of $ 3,340,000  as a result of the issuance of shares.  

Discontinued operation  

Expenses from discontinued operations totaled $nil in the three months ended March 31, and $150,643 in the three months ended March 31, 2015. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

At March 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $116,928 including $90,200 cash on hand, interest receivable of $12,730, other receivable and deposits of $13,998.  Current liabilities totaling $2,714,443 at March 31, 2016 include $1,552,757 from accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $275,109 from accounts payable and accrued liabilities   related parties, $452,417 in other payables, $50,000 in convertible notes payable, net, $34,160 in loans payable, deferred revenue of $350,000.  Presently we rely on advances from third parties, sale of common stock and convertible loans from qualified investors to fund our general operating expenses.  

The Company expects it will need to raise additional capital to fund its proposed operations for the next twelve months, however, the total amount of capital required is presently unknown.  The Company is continuing to evaluate the cash requirements of its recently acquired operations. We intent to fund operations by a combination loans and equity placements. There can be no assurance that continued funding will be available on satisfactory terms. 

Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Operating Activities 

In the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $23,374 as compared to $nil of cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2015. 

6 

Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities 

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company received $50,000 in proceeds from subscription for common shares as compared to $nil of cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2015. 

GOING CONCERN 

The Company has incurred substantial net losses since inception and had a working capital deficiency of $2,597,515 at March 31, 2016.  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects cash flows from operating activities to improve, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue, although there can be no assurance thereof. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans. 

There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company's existing stockholders. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, and revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. 

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2016.  While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This new standard provides guidance on how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value. This standard requires that entities measure certain equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . The new standard requires that all lessees recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet and disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its leasing arrangements. The new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2019. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The new standard involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2017. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230 -Statement of Cash Flows): The amendments provide guidance in the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investees. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Topic 740): This update simplifies the accounting for the income tax consequences of transfers of assets from one unit of a corporation to another unit or subsidiary by eliminating an accounting exception that prevents the recognition of current and deferred income tax consequences for such  intra-entity transfers  until the assets have been sold to an outside party. The amendment should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as  special purpose entities  (SPEs). 

Item 3.                 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk   

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4.                 Controls and Procedures 

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls. In designing and evaluating the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, Company management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company's CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of March 31, 2016, and based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive and financial officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management of the Company on a timely basis in order to comply with the Company's disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company's principal executive and financial officer s conclusion regarding the Company's disclosure controls and procedures is based on management's conclusion that the Company's internal control over financial reporting are ineffective, as described in our Annual Report on Form 10K as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2015, which included a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures on Controls and Procedures. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
