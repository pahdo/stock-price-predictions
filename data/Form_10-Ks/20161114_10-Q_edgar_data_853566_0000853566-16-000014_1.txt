     NOTE A - ORGANIZATION    
 
   Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund II Limited Partnership (the "Partnership") was 
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware as of September 28, 1989, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes ("Operating Partnerships"). Effective as of June 1, 2001 there was a restructuring, and as a result, the Partnership's general partner was reorganized as follows.  The general partner of the Partnership continues to be Boston Capital Associates II Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership.  The general partner of the general partner is BCA Associates Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, whose sole general partner is C M Management, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and whose limited partners are Herbert F. Collins and John P. Manning.  Mr. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc. The limited partner of the general partner is Capital Investment Holdings, a general partnership whose partners are certain officers and employees of Boston Capital Partners, Inc. and its affiliates. The assignor limited partner is BCTC II Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is now wholly-owned by John P. Manning.   
   
  Pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the Partnership filed a Form S-11 
Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effective 
October 25, 1989, which covered the offering (the "Public Offering") of the 
Partnership's beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") representing 
assignments of units of the beneficial interest of the limited partnership 
interest of the assignor limited partner.  The Partnership registered 
20,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC for sale to the public in six series.  The 
Partnership sold 1,036,100 of Series 7 BACs, 4,178,029 of Series 9 BACs, 
2,428,925 of Series 10 BACs, 2,489,599 of Series 11 BACs, 2,972,795 of Series 
12 BACs, and 5,574,290 of Series 14 BACs.  As of September 30, 2016 1,036,100 BACs in Series 7, 4,145,929 BACs in Series 9, 2,409,225 BACs in Series 10, 2,484,999 BACs in Series 11, 2,933,895 BACs in Series 12, and 5,507,640 BACs in Series 14 are outstanding. The Partnership issued the last BACs in Series 14 on January 27, 1992.  This concluded the Public Offering of the Partnership. 
 
   NOTE B - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES  
  
   The condensed financial statements included herein as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and six months then ended have been prepared by the Partnership, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  No BACs with respect to Series 8 and Series 13 were offered.  The Partnership accounts for its investments in Operating Partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Partnership adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership's results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.

NOTE B - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES - CONTINUED  
 
     Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring the investments in Operating Partnerships were capitalized to the investment account.  The Partnership's accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include adjustments in interim periods considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. 
 
   NOTE C - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
 
   The Partnership has entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Holdings, L.P. and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership, or BCAMLP, as follows: 
   
 Accounts payable affiliates at September 30, 2016 and 2015 represents 
accrued general and administrative expenses, accrued partnership management fees, and advances from an affiliate of the general partner, which are payable to Boston Capital Holdings, L.P. and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited 
Partnership.  
   
 An annual partnership management fee based on .5 percent of the aggregate 
cost of all apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships has been 
accrued to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership.  Since reporting fees collected by the series were added to reserves and not paid to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership, the amounts accrued are not net of reporting fees received.

   During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership disposed of five Operating Partnerships. A summary of the disposition by Series for September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

During the six months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership disposed of five Operating Partnerships. A summary of the disposition by Series for September 30, 2015 is as follows: 

* Partnership proceeds from disposition do not include $15,687, which was due to a write-off of capital contribution payable as of September 30, 2015, for Series 14. 
   
 The gain described above is for financial statement purposes only.  There are significant differences between the equity method of accounting and the tax reporting of income and losses from Operating Partnership investments. The largest difference is the ability, for tax purposes, to deduct losses in excess of the Partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership.  As such, the amount of gain recognized for tax purposes may be significantly higher than the gain recorded in the financial statements. 
   
 The Partnership's fiscal year ends March 31 of each year, while all the Operating Partnerships' fiscal years are the calendar year. Pursuant to the provisions of each Operating Partnership agreement, financial results for each of the Operating Partnerships are provided to the Partnership within 45 days after the close of each Operating Partnership's quarterly period. Accordingly, the current financial results available for the Operating Partnerships are for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

      NOTE E - TAXABLE LOSS 
 
    The taxable loss for the calendar year ended December 31, 2016 is expected to differ from its loss for financial reporting purposes. This is primarily due to accounting differences in depreciation incurred by the Operating Partnerships and also differences between the equity method of accounting and the IRS accounting methods. 
 
   NOTE F - INCOME TAXES 
   
   The Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.  Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.  The Partnership's federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.  The Partnership is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Partnership has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.  Income tax returns filed by the Partnership are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.  While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2012 remain open. 
   
   NOTE G - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
     
 Events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were available to be issued must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.  The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that existed after the balance sheet date, require disclosure in the accompanying notes.  Management evaluated the activity of the Partnership through the date the financial statements were issued, and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.

   NOTE H - PLAN OF LIQUIDATION 
       
   On March 3, 2010, our General Partner recommended that the BAC holders approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution for the Partnership, or the  Plan.   The Plan was approved by the BAC holders on July 1, 2010, and was adopted by the General Partner on July 1, 2010.  Pursuant to the Plan, the General Partner is able to, without further action by the BAC holders:  

liquidate the assets and wind up the business of the Partnership; 
 make liquidating distributions in cancellation of the BACs;  
 dissolve the Partnership after the sale of all of the Partnership's assets; and 
 take, or cause the Partnership to take, such other acts and deeds and shall do, or cause the Partnership to do, such other things, as are necessary or appropriate in connection with the dissolution, winding up and liquidation of the Partnership, the termination of the responsibilities and liabilities of the Partnership under applicable law, and the termination of the existence of the Partnership.  

Since the approval of the Plan by the BAC holders, we have continued to seek to sell the assets of the Partnership and use the sale proceeds and/or other Partnership funds to pay all expenses in connection with such sales, pay or make provision for payment of all Partnership obligations and liabilities, including accrued fees, and unpaid loans to the General Partner, and distribute the remaining assets as set forth in the Partnership Agreement.  We expected to complete the sale of the apartment complexes approximately three to five years after the BAC holders approval of the Plan, which was July 1, 2010.  However, because of numerous uncertainties, the liquidation has taken longer than originally projected.  At this time, the General Partner estimates that an additional two to four years will be needed to effectuate the liquidation as approved by the BAC holders, and the final liquidating distribution may occur months after all of the apartment complexes have been sold.  As liquidation is not imminent, the Partnership will continue to report as a going concern.  
   
 For additional information regarding the sale of Partnership assets, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
               Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are  forward looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. 
   
    Liquidity    
 
The Partnership's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering.  Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the six months ended September 30, 2016 or on working capital reserves, (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Partnership has invested and (iii) proceeds received from the dispositions of the Operating Partnership that are returned to fund reserves.  These sources of liquidity, along with the Partnership's working capital reserve, are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership.  The Partnership does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships. 
   
 The Partnership has recognized other income for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in the amount of $534,503 and $127,517. The balance represents distributions received from Operating Partnerships, which the Partnership normally records as a decrease in the Investment in Operating Partnerships. Due to the equity method of accounting, the Partnership has recorded these distributions as other income.  
   
 The Partnership is currently accruing the partnership management fee.  Partnership management fees accrued during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $60,799 and total partnership management fees accrued as of September 30, 2016 were $12,045,976. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership paid $125,209 in accrued partnership management fees. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Partnership receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships, which will be used to satisfy these liabilities.  The Partnership's working capital and sources of liquidity coupled with affiliated party liability accruals allow sufficient levels of liquidity to meet the third party obligations of the Partnership.  The Partnership is currently unaware of any trends that would create insufficient liquidity to meet future third party obligations of the Partnership. 
 
 As of September 30, 2016, an affiliate of the general partner of the Partnership advanced a total of $153,188, on behalf of Series 12, to pay some operating expenses of the Partnership, and to make advances and/or loans to Operating Partnerships. These advances are included in Accounts payable affiliates.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership did not receive any repayment of advances.  
   
 All payables to affiliates will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the Partnership's interests in Operating Partnerships.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, no payments were made to an affiliate of the general partner. 
   
    Capital Resources  
 
   The Partnership offered BACs in a Public Offering declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 1989.  The Partnership received and accepted subscriptions for $186,337,017 representing 18,679,738 BACs from investors admitted as BAC holders in Series 7 through Series 14 of the Partnership.    
 
 As of September 30, 2016 the Partnership had $1,333,491 remaining in cash and cash equivalents.  Below is a table, which provides, by series, the equity raised, number of BACs sold, final date BACs were offered, number of properties held at September 30, 2016, and cash and cash equivalents. 

Reserve balances are remaining proceeds less outstanding capital contribution obligations, which have not been advanced or loaned to the Operating Partnerships.  The reserve balances for Series 9,11,12 and 14 as of September 30, 2016 are $651,094, $156,882, $194,442 and $321,832, respectively. 
   
 (Series 8)  No BACs with respect to Series 8 were offered. 

(Series 13)  No BACs with respect to Series 13 were offered. 

Results of Operations 
 
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Partnership held limited partnership interests in 34 and 54 Operating Partnerships, respectively.  In each instance the apartment complex owned by the applicable Operating Partnership is eligible for the federal housing tax credit.  Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as "Qualified Occupancy."  Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable report on Form 8-K.  The general partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties. 
 
 The Partnership incurs an annual partnership management fee to the general partner of the Partnership and/or its affiliates in an amount equal to 0.5% of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various partnership management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. The partnership management fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

The Partnership's investment objectives do not include receipt of significant cash distributions from the Operating Partnerships in which it has invested.  The Partnership's investments in Operating Partnerships have been made principally with a view towards realization of federal housing tax credits for allocation to its partners and BAC holders. 

(Series 7)   
   
 The series did not have any properties as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 (Series 9)  
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100%.  The series had a total of 7 properties at September 30, 2016, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.   
 
 For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Series 9 reflects loss from Operating Partnerships of $(50,060) and $(111,461), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $180,677 and $216,066, respectively. This is an interim period estimate; it is not indicative of the final year end results. 
   
 In July 2015 the investment general partner transferred its interest in Longmeadow Housing Associates LP to an entity affiliated with the operating general partner for its assumption of the outstanding mortgage balance of approximately $1,349,196 and cash proceeds to the investment partnership of $1,593.  The total proceeds of approximately $1,593 were returned to cash reserves held by Series 9.  The monies held in cash reserves will be utilized to pay current operating expenses, accrued but unpaid asset management fees, and accrued but unpaid expenses of the investment partnership.  After all outstanding obligations of the investment partnership are satisfied, any remaining monies will be distributed based on the number of BACs held by each investor at the time of distribution.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero. Accordingly, a gain on the transfer of the Operating Partnership has been recorded in the amount of $1,593 as of September 30, 2015. 
   
 In August 2016, the investment general partner transferred its interest in Bloomingdale Properties Limited Partnership to an entity affiliated with the operating general partner for its assumption of the outstanding mortgage balance of approximately $1,335,049 and cash proceeds to the investment partnership of $3,900.  Of the total proceeds received, $3,900 will be paid to BCAMLP for expenses related to the transfer, which include third party legal costs.  There were no remaining cash proceeds to be returned to cash reserves held by Series 9.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero. Accordingly, no gain on the transfer of the Operating Partnership has been recorded as of September 30, 2016.  The investment general partner received $534,211 from settlement proceeds which has been recorded as other income as of September 30, 2016. 
   
 The investment general partner will continue to monitor the following Operating Partnerships because of operational or other issues. However, these Operating Partnerships have all exited their LIHTC compliance period and there is therefore no risk to past credit delivery. 
   
 Glenwood Hotel Investors

 (Series 10)  
   
 As of September 30, 2015, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100%.  The series did not have any properties as of September 30, 2016.  
 
 For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Series 10 reflects net loss from Operating Partnerships of $0 and $(100,179), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $0 and $133,164, respectively. This is an interim period estimate; it is not indicative of the final year end results.

The total proceeds of approximately $1,593 were returned to cash reserves held by Series 10.  The monies held in cash reserves will be utilized to pay current operating expenses, accrued but unpaid asset management fees, and accrued but unpaid expenses of the investment partnership.  After all outstanding obligations of the investment partnership are satisfied, any remaining monies will be distributed based on the number of BACs held by each investor at the time of distribution.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.

 None. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
      
   The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Partnership to make various estimates and assumptions.  The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations.  The Partnership believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. 
   
 The Partnership is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.  The Partnership accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Partnership does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships. The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments. 
   
 If the book value of the Partnership's investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Partnership and the estimated residual value to the Partnership, the Partnership reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.  
   
 In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Partnership determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.  A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE. 
   
 Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.  However, management does not consolidate the Partnership's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.  The Partnership currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Partnership's balance in investment in Operating Partnerships represents its maximum exposure to loss.  The Partnership's exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Partnership.

ASU 2015-02 simplified and improves GAAP by: eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, eliminating the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Partnership has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.

  Controls and Procedures  

(a)  
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Partnership's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of C M Management Inc., carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Partnership's  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 with respect to each series individually, as well as the Partnership as a whole. Based on that evaluation, the Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Partnership as a whole, were effective to ensure that information relating to any series or the Partnership as a whole required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership's management, including the Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)  
 
  Changes in Internal Controls  

There were no changes in the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
