These accompanying notes form an integral part of these condensed
interim consolidated financial statements 

1.    NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS    

On August 25, 2010, International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.
( ITH ) completed a Plan of Arrangement (the  Arrangement ) whereby its existing Alaska mineral properties
(other than the Livengood project) and related assets and the North Bullfrog mineral property and related assets in Nevada (collectively,
the  Nevada and Other Alaska Business ) were indirectly spun out into a new public company, being Corvus Gold Inc.
( Corvus  or the  Company ). As part of the Arrangement, ITH transferred its wholly-owned subsidiary Corvus
Nevada (which held the North Bullfrog property), to Corvus and a wholly-owned Alaskan subsidiary of ITH, Talon Gold Alaska, Inc.
sold to Raven Gold, the Terra, Chisna, LMS and West Pogo properties. As a consequence of the completion of the Arrangement, the
Terra, Chisna, LMS, West Pogo and North Bullfrog properties were transferred to Corvus. 

The Company was incorporated on April 13, 2010 under the
 Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) . These consolidated financial statements reflect the cumulative operating results
of the predecessor, as related to the mineral properties that were transferred to the Company from June 1, 2006. 

The Company is engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring
and evaluating mineral properties, and either joint venturing or developing these properties further or disposing of them when
the evaluation is completed. At August 31, 2016, the Company had interests in a property in Nevada, U.S.A. 

The business of mining and exploration involves a high
degree of risk and there can be no assurance that current exploration programs will result in profitable mining operations. The
Company has no source of revenue, and has significant cash requirements to meet its administrative overhead and maintain its mineral
property interests. The recoverability of amounts shown for mineral properties is dependent on several factors. These include the
discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete the development
of these properties, and future profitable production or proceeds from disposition of mineral properties. The carrying value of
the Company s mineral properties does not reflect current or future values. 

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which presume the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal
course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving
profitable operations and/or obtaining additional financing. 

In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,
management takes into account all available information about the future within one year from the date the condensed interim consolidated
financial statements are issued.  There is substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as going concern,
as explained in the following paragraphs. 

The Company has sustained losses from operations, has
negative cash flows, and has an ongoing requirement for capital investment to explore its mineral properties.  As at August
31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $6,105,309 compared to working capital of $4,742,321 as at May 31, 2016. 
On July 15, 2016, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement equity financing and issued 2,550,000 common shares at a
price of $1.02 per Share for gross proceeds of $2,601,000. Based on its current plans, budgeted expenditures, and cash requirements,
the Company does not have sufficient cash to finance its current plans for the 12 months from the date the condensed interim consolidated
financial statement are issued and will be required to raise additional funds through public or private equity financings, significantly
reduce exploration expenditures and administrative expenses, or consider other options such as sales of its mineral properties,
in order to continue in business. 

The Company also expects that it will need to raise substantial
additional capital to accomplish its business plan over the next several years.  Should such financing not be available in
that time-frame, the Company will be required to reduce its activities and will not be able to carry out all of its presently planned
exploration and development activities on its currently anticipated scheduling.    

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue in business. 

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis of presentation  

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for
annual financial statements. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016 as filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the opinion of the Company s management these financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position at August 31, 2016 and the results of its operations
for the three months then ended. Operating results for the three months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending May 31, 2017. The 2016 year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited
financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with US GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the period. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management s
experience and knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances. While management believes the estimates to be reasonable, actual
results could differ from those estimates and could impact future results of operations and cash flows. 

Basis of consolidation  

These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Group ), Corvus
Gold (USA) Inc. ( Corvus USA ) (a Nevada corporation), Corvus Gold Nevada Inc. ( Corvus Nevada ) (a Nevada
corporation), Raven Gold Alaska Inc. ( Raven Gold ) (an Alaska corporation) and SoN Land and Water LLC ( SoN )
(a Nevada limited liability company). All intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated upon consolidation. 

Earnings (loss) per share  

Basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company uses the treasury stock method to compute the dilutive
effect of options, warrants and similar instruments. Under this method, the dilutive effect on earnings (loss) per share is calculated
presuming the exercise of outstanding options, warrants and similar instruments. It assumes that the proceeds of such exercise
would be used to repurchase common shares at the average market price during the period. However, the calculation of diluted loss
per share excludes the effects of various conversions and exercise of options and warrants that would be anti-dilutive. For the
period ended August 31, 2016, 7,831,000 outstanding stock options (2015   7,376,334) were not included in the calculation
of diluted earnings (loss) per share as their inclusion was anti-dilutive. 

3.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT    

4.    MINERAL PROPERTIES    

The Company had the following activity related to capitalized
acquisition costs: 

The following table presents costs incurred for exploration
and evaluation activities for the three months ended August 31, 2016: 

The following table presents costs incurred for exploration
and evaluation activities for the three months ended August 31, 2015: 

a)    Chisna Property, Alaska    

The Chisna property is located in the eastern Alaska Range,
Alaska, and is comprised of unpatented mineral claims owned 100% by the Company and fee simple lands leased from Ahtna Incorporated
( Ahtna ). 

On November 2, 2009, ITH and Talon Gold Alaska, Inc. (ITH s
wholly-owned Alaskan subsidiary) entered into an agreement (as amended) with Ocean Park Ventures Corp. ( OPV ). Pursuant
to the agreement, an Alaskan subsidiary of OPV and Raven Gold formed a joint venture for the purpose of exploring and developing
the Chisna property. 

On November 7, 2012, OPV withdrew from the joint venture
and thereby returned 100% of the Chisna Project to the Company. 

On March 24, 2010, Raven Gold entered into a Mineral Exploration
Agreement with Option to Lease with Ahtna, an Alaska Native Regional Corporation, concerning approximately 26,516 hectares of fee
simple lands in the Athell Area of Alaska surrounding or adjacent to some of the blocks of mineral claims owned by Raven Gold. 

During the year ended May 31, 2015, the Company gave
notification and terminated the Ahtna lease. 

During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company wrote
off the Chisna property as the Company, at the time, had reduced the Chisna property to 36 core claims. On April 5, 2016, Raven
Gold completed a transaction with Millrock Resources Inc. ( Millrock ) on the Chisna property. The ownership of the
property was sold for USD 25,000 and a retained net smelter return ( NSR ) royalty of 1% on precious metals and 1%
on base metals. 

b)    West Pogo Property, Alaska    

The West Pogo property is located approximately 50 kilometres
north of Delta Junction, Alaska, and consists of unpatented mineral claims owned 100% by the Company. 

During the year ended May 31, 2014, the Company wrote off
the West Pogo property, as there had been a delay in exploration work on the property for an extended period of time. 

During the year ended May 31, 2016, Raven Gold completed
a transaction with Millrock Resources Inc. ( Millrock ) on the West Pogo and Goodpaster database projects in Alaska.
The ownership position was sold for $25,728 (USD 20,000) and the Goodpaster database project was sold for $136,058 (USD 100,000)
and reflected as cost recovery for the West Pogo and LMS project. For the West Pogo project, the Company retained net smelter return
( NSR ) royalties of 3% on precious metals and 1% on base metals with 1% of the precious metal royalty buy down for
USD 2 million and a further 1% for an additional USD 5 million. For the Goodpaster database, the Company retained NSR royalty of
1% on all new claims acquired within the defined Area of Interest which totals some 1,500 square kilometres covering the largest
gold producing District in Alaska. One half of the royalty can be purchased for USD 2 million. 

c)    LMS Property, Alaska    

The LMS property consists of unpatented mineral claims
owned 100% by the Company. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company sold the LMS property for a consideration of $473,585
(USD 350,000) and was granted a retained NSR royalty of 3% on precious metals and 1% on base metals with a 1% on buy down of the
precious metal royalty for USD$4,000,000. 

d)    North Bullfrog Project, Nevada    

The Company s North Bullfrog project consists of
certain leased patented lode mining claims and federal unpatented mining claims owned 100% by the Company. 

(i)   Interests acquired from Redstar Gold Corp.    

On October 9, 2009, a US subsidiary of ITH at the time
(Corvus Nevada) completed the acquisition of all of the interests of Redstar Gold Corp. ( Redstar ) and Redstar Gold
U.S.A. Inc. ( Redstar US ) in the North Bullfrog project, which consisted of the following leases:

(ii)   Interests
acquired directly by Corvus Nevada    

(1)  Pursuant to a mining lease and option to purchase agreement made effective December 1, 2007
between Corvus Nevada and a group of arm s length limited partnerships, Corvus Nevada has leased (and has the option to purchase)
patented mining claims referred to as the  Mayflower  claims which form part of the North Bullfrog project. The terms
of the lease/option are as follows:   

Terms : Initial term of five years, commencing December 1, 2007, with the option to extend
the lease for an additional five years. The lease will continue for as long thereafter as the property is in commercial production
or, alternatively, for an additional three years if Corvus Nevada makes advance minimum royalty payments of USD 100,000 per
year (which are recoupable against actual production royalties).   

Work Commitments : USD 100,000 per year for the first three years (incurred), USD 200,000
per year for the years 4   6 (incurred) and USD 300,000 for the years 7   10. Excess expenditures in any year may be
carried forward. If Corvus Nevada does not incur the required expenditures in year one, the deficiency is required to be paid to
the lessors.   

Retained Royalty : Corvus Nevada will pay the lessors a NSR royalty of 2% if the average
gold price is USD 400 per ounce or less, 3% if the average gold price is between USD 401 and USD 500 per ounce and 4% if the
average gold price is greater than USD 500 per ounce.   

(2)  Pursuant to a mining lease and option to purchase made effective March 1, 2011 between Corvus Nevada
and an arm s length individual, Corvus Nevada has leased, and has the option to purchase, 2 patented mineral claims which
form part of the North Bullfrog project holdings. The lease is for an initial term of 10 years, subject to extension for an additional
10 years (provided advance minimum royalties are timely paid), and for so long thereafter as mining activities continue on the
claims. The lessee is required to pay advance minimum royalty payments (recoupable from production royalties, but not applicable
to the purchase price if the option to purchase is exercised) of USD 20,000 on execution (paid), USD 25,000 on each of March 1,
2012 (paid), 2013 (paid) and 2014 (paid), USD 30,000 on March 1, 2015 and each anniversary thereafter (paid to March 1, 2016),
adjusted for inflation. The lessor is entitled to receive a 2% NSR royalty on all production. The lessee may purchase the royalty
for USD 1,000,000 per 1%. If the lessee purchases the entire royalty (USD 2,000,000) the lessee will also acquire all interest
of the lessor in the subject property.   

(5)  On March 30, 2015, Lunar Landing, LLC signed a lease agreement with Corvus Nevada to lease private
property containing the three patented Sunflower claims to Corvus Nevada, which are adjacent to the Yellow Rose claims leased in
2014. The term of the lease is 3 years with provision to extend the lease for an additional 7 years, and an advance minimum royalty
payment of USD 5,000 per year with USD 5,000 paid upon signing (paid to March 2016). The lease includes a 4% NSR royalty on production,
with an option to purchase the royalty for USD 500,000 per 1% or USD 2,000,000 for the entire 4% royalty. The lease also includes
the option to purchase the property for USD 300,000.   

Acquisitions  

The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a
detailed and time-consuming process. The Company has taken steps, in accordance with industry norms, to verify title to mineral
properties in which it has an interest. Although the Company has taken every reasonable precaution to ensure that legal title to
its properties is properly recorded in the name of the Company (or, in the case of an option, in the name of the relevant optionor),
there can be no assurance that such title will ultimately be secured. 

Environmental Expenditures  

The operations of the Company may in the future be affected
from time to time in varying degrees by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future removal and site restoration
costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The
Company s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically
proven and economically feasible measures. 

Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental
and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic
benefits. Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged
against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries. 

The Company has estimated the fair value of the liability
for asset retirement that arose as a result of exploration activities to be $293,713 (USD 224,000) (May 31, 2016 - $293,578 (USD
224,000)). The fair value of the liability was determined to be equal to the estimated remediation costs. Due to the early stages
of the project, and that extractive activities have not yet begun, the Company is unable to predict with any precision the timing
of the cash flow related to the reclamation activities. 

5.    SHARE CAPITAL    

Authorized  

Unlimited common shares without par value. 

Share issuances  

During the period ended August 31, 2016: 

Stock options  

Stock options awarded to employees and non-employees
by the Company are measured and recognized in the Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss
over the vesting period. 

The Company has adopted an incentive stock option plan
(the  2010 Plan ). The essential elements of the 2010 Plan provide that the aggregate number of common shares of the
Company s share capital that may be made issuable pursuant to options granted under the 2010 Plan (together with any other
shares which may be issued under other share compensation plans of the Company) may not exceed 10% of the number of issued shares
of the Company at the time of the granting of the options. Options granted under the 2010 Plan will have a maximum term of ten
years. The exercise price of options granted under the 2010 Plan will not be less than the greater of the market price of the common
shares (as defined by TSX, currently defined as the 5 day volume weighted average price for the 5 trading days immediately preceding
the date of grant) or the closing market price of the Company s common shares for the trading day immediately preceding the
date of grant), or such other price as may be agreed to by the Company and accepted by the TSX. Options granted under the 2010
Plan vest immediately, unless otherwise determined by the directors at the date of grant. 

A summary of the status of the stock option plan as
of August 31 and May 31, 2016, and changes during the periods are presented below: 

The weighted average remaining contractual life of options
outstanding at August 31, 2016 was 2.23 years (May 31, 2016   2.42 years). 

Stock options outstanding are as follows: 

The Company uses the fair value method for determining
stock-based compensation for all options granted during the periods. The fair value of options granted was $21,060 (2015 - $nil),
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions: 

Annualized volatility was determined by reference to
historic volatility of the Company. 

Stock-based compensation has been allocated
as follows: 

6.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

During the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company entered
into the following transactions with related parties: 

As at August 31, 2016, included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities was $9,815 (May 31, 2016   $7,628) in expenses owing to companies related to officers and officers of
the Company. 

These amounts were unsecured, non-interest bearing and
had no fixed terms or terms of repayment. Accordingly, fair value could not be readily determined. 

The Company has also entered into change of control agreements
with officers of the Company. In the case of termination, the officers are entitled to an amount equal to a multiple (ranging from
two times to three times) of the sum of the annual base salary then payable to the officer, the aggregate amount of bonus(es) (if
any) paid to the officer within the calendar year immediately preceding the Effective Date of Termination, and an amount equal
to the vacation pay which would otherwise be payable for the one year period next following the Effective Date of Termination. 

7.    GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTED INFORMATION    

The Company operates in one industry segment, the mineral
resources industry, and in two geographical segments, Canada and the United States. All current exploration activities are conducted
in the United States. The significant asset categories identifiable with these geographical areas are as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended August 31, 2016, and the related
notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S.
GAAP ). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information that involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
and information as a result of many factors. See section heading  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  below.
All currency amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless noted otherwise.  

CAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS REGARDING ESTIMATES OF MEASURED, INDICATED
AND INFERRED RESOURCES AND PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES  

Corvus Gold Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our, 
 Corvus  or the  Company ) is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration
of mineral properties. The mineral estimates in the Technical Report referenced in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of
United States securities laws. As used in the Technical Report referenced in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms
 mineral reserve ,  proven mineral reserve  and  probable mineral reserve  are Canadian mining
terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101  Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects 
( NI 43-101 ) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the  CIM ) CIM Definition
Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. These definitions differ from the
definitions in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Industry Guide 7 ( SEC Industry Guide
7 ). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a  final  or  bankable  feasibility study is required
to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves,
and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. 

In addition, the terms  mineral resource ,  measured
mineral resource ,  indicated mineral resource  and  inferred mineral resource  are defined in and
required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not
permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all
or any part of a mineral deposit in these categories will ever be converted into reserves.  Inferred mineral resources 
have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It
cannot be assumed that all, or any part, of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian
rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare
cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or
legally mineable. Disclosure of  contained ounces  in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations;
however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute  reserves  by SEC
standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. 

Accordingly, information contained in the Technical Report referenced
in this report contain descriptions of our mineral deposits that may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S.
companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE TO ALL INVESTORS CONCERNING ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS
THAT INCLUDE INFERRED RESOURCES  

The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests
in an advanced stage exploration project in Nye County, Nevada referred to as the North Bullfrog Project (the  NBP ).
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. The preliminary assessments on the NBP
are preliminary in nature and include  inferred mineral resources  that have a great amount of uncertainty as to their
existence, and are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them
to be categorized as mineral reserves. It cannot be assumed that all, or any part, of an inferred mineral resource will ever be
upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility
or pre-feasibility studies. There is no certainty that such inferred mineral resources at the NBP will ever be realized. Investors
are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable.

Current Business Activities  

General  

The Company s material mineral property is the NBP, an advanced
exploration stage project in Nevada which has a number of high-priority, bulk tonnage and high-grade vein targets (held through
Corvus Gold Nevada Inc. ( Corvus Nevada ), a Nevada subsidiary). 

The primary focus of the Company will be to leverage its exploration
expertise to expand its existing deposits and discover major new gold deposits. Other than with respect to the ongoing exploration
of the NBP, the Company s strategy is to leverage its other non-core assets by maintaining a retained royalty. 

Highlights of activities during the period and to the date of this
MD A include: 

NBP Exploration: Planning for Phase 2 of the 2016 exploration drilling program was completed and
the initiation of Phase 2 is scheduled for the first half of October 2016. The drilling will focus on resource expansion potential
for the Sierra Blanca/YellowJacket deposit to the north and west in the Swale Zone and to the east in the Liberator Zone. In addition,
two new exploration/new discovery targets will be tested at North Jolly Jane and Cat Hill.   

Results for Phase I drilling in 2016 demonstrated the continuity of gold mineralization directly
adjacent to the current Sierra Blanca/YellowJacket whittle pit shells and indicated newly discovered mineralization at the Swale
target immediately north of the YellowJacket/Sierra Blanca deposits. Drilling during the period in Black Vein-Liberator structure
indicated further exploration potential of this new high grade structural zone.   

Metallurgical composite samples were created and shipped to Hazen Research of Golden, CO to begin
evaluation of processing alternative for the new zones of mineralization identified by drilling northeast and northwest of the
YellowJacket and Sierra Blanca deposits.   

Baseline characterization activities continued with the collection of water quality samples from
NBP water monitoring wells and springs located in the immediate area of NBP.   

Corporate Financial Activities   

On July 18, 2016, the Company announced the closing of a $2,601,000
non-brokered private placement at $1.02 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 2,550,000 common shares. 
The participant in the private placement included Osisko Mining Inc. 

Nevada Property  

North Bullfrog Project   

Our principal mineral property is the NBP, a gold exploration project
located in northwestern Nye County, Nevada, in the Northern Bullfrog Hills about 15 km north of the town of Beatty. The NBP does
not have any known proven or probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 and the project is exploratory in nature. A NI 43-101
technical report entitled  Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment for Combined Mill and Heap Leach Processing
at the North Bullfrog Project Bullfrog Mining District, Nye County, Nevada  with an effective date of June 16, 2015, as amended
and restated on May 18, 2016, (the  Technical Report ) is available under Corvus Gold s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com
and EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov. The Technical Report is referred to herein for informational purposes only and is not incorporated
herein by reference. The Technical Report contains disclosure regarding mineral resources that are not Guide 7 compliant proven
or probable reserves, see  Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources
and Proven and Probable Reserves  above. 

The NBP is located in the Bullfrog Hills of northwestern Nye County,
Nevada (Figure 1). The NBP covers about 7,223 hectares of patented and unpatented mining claims in Sections 20, 21, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36 of T10S, R46E; sections 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of T11S, R46E; section 31 of T10S, R47E; and sections
6, 9, 15, 16, and 17 T11S, R47E, MDBM. We have a total of nine option/lease agreements in place that give us control of an aggregate
of 51 patented lode mining claims (Figure 2). Corvus Nevada owns an additional 5 patented claims (the Millman claims) and a 430
acre property with 1600 acre-feet of water rights located north of NBP in the Sacrobatus hydrographic basin (Basin 146).

Phase I 2016 Drilling Results   

Phase I 2016 drilling has demonstrated the continuity of gold mineralization
directly adjacent to the current whittle pit shell at the NW Sierra Blanca target and produced a significant new discovery at the
Swale target immediately north of the YellowJacket/Sierra Blanca deposits (Figure 3). A total of 6,250 metres of Reverse Circulation
(RC) drilling was completed during 2016 Phase I. Drilling was concentrated around the Swale target located at a major intersection
of the northwest trending YellowJacket zone and the northeast trending NWSB zone. 

Results have returned a number of higher grade (+1 g/t gold) structural
zones within a 500 by 200 metre target area. The initial hole at the new Swale target (NB-16-300) intersected 18.3m of 1.76 g/t
gold and 2.4 g/t silver (Table 1). The new Swale discovery is characterized by extensive quartz stockwork mineralization that is
directly associated with a large rhyolite intrusive. Drilling at the NW Sierra Blanca target has extended gold mineralization to
the northeast toward the current north end of the YellowJacket deposit, with alteration and grades increasing in this direction
(NB-16-298 intersecting 22.9m of 1.69 g/t gold and 2.64 g/t silver, Table 2). Additional drilling was performed to further delineate
mineralization in the Black Vein-Liberator Target and in the Lower Savage Target during this period. The locations of these targets
are shown with respect to the Sierra Blanca-YellowJacket deposits in Figure 3. 

Figure 3. Looking south at the YellowJacket/Sierra Blanca deposit and the surrounding 2016 exploration targets.    

Swale Discovery   

The discovery at the Swale target represents a new style of gold
mineralization with both quartz vein and replacement type mineralization, which are uniquely hosted by an extensive rhyolite intrusive
body that is located at the north end of the YellowJacket trend. Hole NB-16-300 intersected the new zone at the bottom of the hole
(18.3m at 1.76 g/t gold, Table 1). The Swale mineralization is directly associated with an intensely fractured and altered rhyolite
body. Hole NB-16-299 intersected the edge of this new zone at the bottom of the hole where alteration intensity was increasing. 

This newly discovered mineralized zone appears to be associated
with the intersection of two broad NW and NE structural zones at the north end of the current defined YellowJacket deposit. This
major intersection appears to have controlled the emplacement of the extensive rhyolite body and the associated gold mineralization.
The rhyolite intrusive body is highly fractured and forms a favourable host and may have a genetic association with the gold systems
in the area. Two additional holes drilled to the west of NB-16-300 (NB-16-304   -305 in Table 1) intersected thick intervals
of highly altered and quartz veined rhyolite which suggests the favourable host unit extends to the west. In addition the rhyolite
body extends to the north and east of the YellowJacket deposit including the NE-trending, Rhyolite Vein discovered in 2015 in hole
NB-15-267 (NR15-14, October 15, 2015) with 10.7m at 3.5 g/t gold. Locations of some of the drill holes in the Swale Target are
shown in Figure 4. 

Results from holes NB-16-304, -305 and -308 at the Swale target
have now focused our exploration on the potential in this area and confirmed the northern extension of the YellowJacket structural
system. Hole NB-16-308 intersected 3.1 metres at 2.2 g/t gold and 3.5 g/t silver within 9.15m at 1.02 g/t gold and 1.93 silver
which is the northern extension of the structural zone previously encountered in hole NB-16-300 (18.3m at 1.76 g/t gold). Mineralization
in hole NB-16-308 continues to trend NW and is hosted in a dacite unit as opposed to the more favorable rhyolite unit in hole NB-16-300.
This new drilling has extended the YellowJacket system approximately 250 metres northwest of the current YellowJacket resource. 

Figure 4. Drill hole locations map for the Phase I 2016 North
Bullfrog project.   

In addition, the large rhyolite body intersected in holes NB-16-304
and -305 has returned thick intervals of low-grade gold and silver and a number of zones with high levels of uranium and molybdenum.
This highly altered and broadly mineralized rhyolite body has emerged as an important host rock for structurally controlled, YellowJacket
type vein and stockwork zones. A number of the remaining exploration holes in the Swale target area have intersected parallel broad
structural zones to the southwest and south of the zones hit in holes NB-WW-300 and -308. This area is about 500 metres by 200
metres at the north and west end of the current YellowJacket resource. With the earlier results from the NE trending NWSB zone
in hole NB-16-298 (NR16-09, June 7, 2016, 23m at 1.7 g/t gold, Table 2) we are now projecting a major structural intersection of
the two systems at the north end of the current pit design. This complexly faulted area forms an excellent mineralizing environment
for multiple high-grade zones and will be a primary target of resource development drilling in the second phase of the 2016 program. 

Two of the final four holes drilled in the Phase I program targeted
the northern extension of mineralization intersected in hole NB-16-298 (23m at 1.69 g/t gold, NR16-09, June 7, 2016, Table 2) and
returned encouraging intercepts such as NB-16-310 with 13.7m at 1.18 g/t gold and NB-16-312 with 4.6m at 1.08 g/t gold and 6.1m
at 1.2 g/t gold (Table 1 and Figure 5). These intervals are surrounded by over 100 metres of low-grade mineralization indicating
the system remains very strong to the north of the currently defined Sierra Blanca/YellowJacket deposit. The current interpretation
of the higher grade mineralization in this area indicates it is controlled by a series of north and northeast trending structures
and structural intersections with the major northeast structural zone hosting the mineralization in hole NB-16-298. 

Figure 5  Drill hole locations for Phase I 2016 drilling
near the Swale and Liberator Zones.   

Hole NB-16-309 tested the Swale system 200 metres to the southwest
of hole NB-16-300 (18m at 1.8 g/t gold, NR16-09, June 7, 2016) and returned several broad intercepts of low-grade mineralization
including 65.5m of 0.40 g/t gold (Table 1). This broad zone of gold mineralization from the currently farthest west hole drilled
in this area, indicates the system remains open and suggests that potential exists in this direction for other feeder zones. 

Holes NB-16-311 was drilled north of prior hole NB-16-308 (3.1m
at 2.24 g/t gold, NR16-11, August 2, 2016) but failed to hit the favourable host rock package or any significant mineralization.

NW Sierra Blanca Target   

A total of six holes from the 2016 exploration program have been
returned from the NW Sierra Blanca target covering about 400 metres of the north end of the system. These results continue to show
good continuity of the new mineralized zone which lies just west of the current resource/whittle shell boundary. The current data
has shown that grades are increasing to the northeast toward the north end of the YellowJacket deposit with the farthest hole to
the northeast, NB-16-298 returning 22.9 meters of 1.69 g/t gold and 2.6 g/t silver (Table 2) from a broad zone of stockwork quartz
veining. This new vein system discovery is about 100 metres west and trends parallel to the YellowJacket deposit. When linked with
prior intercepts like hole NB-15-282 (NR16-02, January 19, 2016) which returned 3.1m at 5 g/t gold and 42 g/t silver within 19.8m
of 1.7 g/t Au and 12 g/t Ag the area has emerged as a significant new zone of high grade mineralization which could expand the
current mill resource, follow up drilling is planned.

and Swale Targets

Black Vein - Liberator Target   

Initial drill results from the Black Vein target have highlighted
the importance of the re-emerging Liberator structural zone, a parallel structural zone just east of the YellowJacket deposit with
potential to host high-grade mineralization. Significantly, drill hole NB-16-303 drilled into the Black Vein target returned 153.9m
at 0.54 g/t gold   0.92 g/t silver (Table 3). Follow up drilling is being planned to test for significant tonnage of higher
grade mineralization. 

Drill holes NB-16-303 was drilled to test the deep potential below
earlier high-grade intersection returned from the Liberator structural zone in the Black Vein target area; NB-10-63 (NR11-03, February
1, 2011) with 13.7m @ 5.9 g/t gold   5.2 g/t silver and NB-12-126 (NR12-10, March 22, 2012) with 5.7m @ 6.6 g/t gold  
9.9 g/t silver). Results from hole NB-16-303 intersected a very broad zone of gold mineralization within the target (153.9m @ 0.54
g/t gold). This very thick zone of gold mineralization and the shallower high-grade intersections appears to be associated with
the large Liberator fault system which lies just east of the YellowJacket deposit but dips in the opposite direction. The Liberator
structural zone has not been effectively explored in the past and is now emerging as an important target area immediately east
of the current pit design. It s also possible that the previously discovered Rhyolite zone (10.7m @ 3.5 g/t gold) and the
350 zone (6m @ 2.4 g/t gold) are also related to the Liberator system which has a known strike length of over a kilometre. This
emerging new YellowJacket type target will also be tested in the next phase of drilling. 

Scout drilling was completed to test the depth potential of the
Liberator zone to the east and to test a wildcat vein target in the Cloud 9 area. Hole NB-16-306 was drilled about 100 metres east
of the Black Vein target and intersected a broad low-grade interval of gold mineralization deep along the Liberator fault (~400m
below surface). This mineralization indicates the Liberator gold system is extensive. Hole NB-16-307 tested the Cloud 9 target,
a banded quartz vein outcropping along the West Jolly Jane fault about 800 metres east of Black Vein and about 2 kilometres north
of the Jolly Jane deposit, although altered the hole failed to return any significant gold or silver values.

vein/stockwork intervals calculated @ 0.5 g/t Au cut  

Lower Savage Target    

Significant intercepts in the Lower Savage Target drilled in this
period are listed in Table 3. Two holes were drilled to follow-up high-grade silver mineralization found at depth below a large
new zone of low-grade mineralization east of the current pit design. These two holes drilled 100 metres north and south of the
original discovery hole NB-15-273 (NR16-03, January 26, 2016, 3.1m @ 2.1 g/t gold   178 g/t silver) and intersected thick zones
of low-grade mineralization confirming the systems extension to the east. In hole NB-16-301 a thicker zone of silver mineralization
( 1 5.2m @ 0.4 g/t gold and 23 g/t silver) was intersected in the same horizon as the earlier intercept in hole 273. The hole
to the north, NB-16-302 also hit this horizon but only returned low-grade silver (37m @ ~0.4 g/t silver). The mineralization appears
to be related to a replacement style within a specific horizon in the volcanic package near the basement contact. Although intriguing,
this deeper replacement style of mineralization will not be followed up in the next phase of drilling. 

Project Development Activities    

Monitoring programs to develop baseline characterization data for
support of future permitting activities continued during the period. Water quality samples were collected from NBP monitoring wells
and surrounding areal springs in September. Meteorological monitoring continued with quarterly reports submitted to NDEP. The NDWR
permit for the 1600 acre-feet of water rights in Sarcobatus (Basin 146) was renewed by the Nevada State Engineer for the 2016-2017
period. 

Phase II Drill Program    

Corvus Gold will begin its 2016 Phase II drill program in mid-October
when an RC drilling rig is scheduled to return to NBP. The program will involve approximately 7,000 metres of reverse circulation
drilling designed to address resource expansion potential for the Sierra Blanca/YellowJacket deposit to the north and west in the
Swale Zone and to the east in the Liberator Zone. In addition, two new exploration/new discovery targets will be tested at North
Jolly Jane and Cat Hill. All of the planned exploration and development programs for 2016 and 2017 as well as corporate costs are
fully funded.

Results of Operations  

Three months ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three months ended
August 31, 2015  

For the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company had a net
loss of $1,505,937 compared to a net loss of $1,821,292 in the comparative period of the prior year. Included in net loss was $176,238
(2015 - $294,881) in stock-based compensation charges which is a result of previously granted stock options which vested during
the period. The decrease in loss of $315,355 in the three month period of the current year was due to a combination of factors
discussed below. 

The primary factor for the decrease in the net loss was the exploration
expenditures of $653,506 incurred in the current period compared to $790,059 in the comparative period of the prior year. The exploration
activities of the Company decreased mainly due to less funding being available in the current period compared with the comparative
period of the prior year and a decrease in stock-based compensation charges of $4,635 in the current period compared to $5,455
in the prior period. 

Consulting fees decreased to $161,266 (2015 - $192,393) mainly due
to decreased stock-based compensation charges of $98,516 during the current period compared to $131,643 in the comparative period
of the prior year offset by an increase in consulting fees of $2,000 mainly due to increase in directors  fees. 

Investor relations expenses decreased to $145,480 (2015- $164,774)
mainly due to decreased stock-based compensation charges of $20,534 during the current period compared to $38,901 in the comparative
period of the prior year. 

Wages and benefits decreased to $340,086 (2015 - $579,010) mainly
due to decreased stock-based compensation charges of $50,645 during the current period compared to $110,645 in the comparative
period of the prior year and a decrease of $178,924 in wages and benefits in the current period mainly as a result of adjustment
in wages of several senior executive officers offset by the severance pay to the former President in the comparative period of
the prior year. 

Other expense categories that reflected only moderate change period
over period were administration expenses of $361 (2015 - $2,775), depreciation expenses of $5,322 (2015 - $6,300), insurance expenses
of $29,482 (2015 - $31,060), office expenses of $28,885 (2015 - $38,622), professional fees of $65,162 (2015 - $70,482), regulatory
expenses of $22,829 (2015 - $26,981), rent expenses of $28,883 (2015   $26,300) and travel expenses of $18,829 (2015 - $17,675). 

Other items amounted to a loss of $5,846 compared to a gain of $125,139
in the comparative period of the prior year. There was a gain on sale of the Company s interest in the West Pogo property
of $nil in the current period compared to $25,728 in the comparative period of the prior year. There was an increase in foreign
exchange to a loss of $14,610 (2015 - gain of $93,846), which is the result of factors outside of the Company s control and
an increase in interest income of $8,764 (2015 - $5,565) as a result of more investment in cashable GIC s during the current
period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has no revenue generating operations from which it can
internally generate funds. To date, the Company s ongoing operations have been financed by the sale of its equity securities
by way of public offerings, private placements and the exercise of incentive stock options and share purchase warrants. The Company
believes that it will be able to secure additional private placements and public financings in the future, although it cannot predict
the size or pricing of any such financings. In addition, the Company can raise funds through the sale of interests in its mineral
properties, although current market conditions have substantially reduced the number of potential buyers/acquirers of any such
interest(s). This situation is unlikely to change until such time as the Company can develop a bankable feasibility study on one
of its projects. When acquiring an interest in mineral properties through purchase or option, the Company will sometimes issue
common shares to the vendor or optionee of the property as partial or full consideration for the property interest in order to
conserve its cash. 

The Company reported cash and cash equivalents of $6,038,546 as
at August 31, 2016 compared to $4,783,519 as at May 31, 2016. The change in cash position was the net result of $1,417,728
used for operating activities, $4,271 used on property and equipment, $2,689,485 received from the private placement of common
shares in July of 2016 (net of share issue costs) and exercise of stock options during the three months ended August 31, 2016. 

As at August 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $6,105,309
compared to working capital of $4,742,321 as at May 31, 2016. The Company expects that it will operate at a loss for the foreseeable
future and believes the current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for it to maintain its currently held properties,
and fund its currently anticipated general and administrative costs until May 31, 2019. Following May 31, 2019, the Company will
need to scale back anticipated activities and costs or raise additional financing to fund operations through the year ending May
31, 2020. The Company s current anticipated operating expenses are $2,489,000 until December 31, 2016 and $4,826,000 until
August 31, 2017. The Company s anticipated monthly burn rate averages approximately $622,000 for September to December 2016,
where approximately $282,000 is for administrative purposes and approximately $340,000 is for planned exploration expenditures
related to the completion of the ongoing Phase II exploration program at the NBP. From September 2016 to August 2017, the Company s
anticipated monthly burn rate averages approximately $402,000, of which $234,000 is for administrative purposes and approximately
$168,000 is for planned exploration expenditures related to the ongoing Phase II exploration program at the NBP. In any event,
the Company will be required to raise additional funds, again through public or private equity financings, prior to the end of
September 2019 in order to continue in business. Should such financing not be available in that time-frame, the Company will be
required to reduce its activities and will not be able to carry out all of its presently planned exploration and development activities
at the NBP on its currently anticipated scheduling. 

The Company currently has no further funding commitments or arrangements
for additional financing at this time (other than the potential exercise of incentive stock options) and there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. There is significant uncertainty that
the Company will be able to secure any additional financing in the current equity markets. The quantity of funds to be raised and
the terms of any proposed equity financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds
arise. 

The Company has no exposure to any asset-backed commercial paper.
Other than cash held by its subsidiaries for their immediate operating needs in Alaska and Nevada, all of the Company s cash
reserves are on deposit with a major Canadian chartered bank. The Company does not believe that the credit, liquidity or market
risks with respect thereto have increased as a result of the current market conditions. However, in order to achieve greater security
for the preservation of its capital, the Company has, of necessity, been required to accept lower rates of interest, which has
also lowered its potential interest income. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Environmental Regulations  

The operations of the Company may in the future be affected from
time to time in varying degrees by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future removal and site restoration
costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The
Company s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically
proven and economically feasible measures. 

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders  

The Company has been a  passive foreign investment company 
( PFIC ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes in recent years and expects to continue to be a PFIC in the future. Current
and prospective U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of PFIC classification and the U.S.
federal tax treatment of PFICs. Additional information on this matter is included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K as filed with the SEC on August 22, 2016, under  Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations . 

Emerging Growth Company Status   

We qualify as an  emerging growth company  as defined
in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act ) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in
annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of May 31, 2016, being the last day of our last fiscal year. 

We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last
day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000
in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed
to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following
the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement
(August 28, 2019). 

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided
below: 

Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company s auditor to attest to, and report on, management's assessment of its internal controls.  

Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.  

As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not
be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we may however determine to voluntarily comply with such requirements in our discretion. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of August 31, 2016, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision
of and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive
officer) and Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act). Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of August 31,
2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed
in reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
in a manner that allows for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and
procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system will be
met and is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgement in designing, implementing and evaluating controls
and procedures and the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting
during the period ended August 31, 2016 that have materially, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES  

Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that
are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose
specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety
and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ) which
is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor s Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ). During the
three month period ended August 31, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries and their properties or operations were not subject
to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
