NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED)    

NOTE 1   THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Finjan Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company  or  Finjan Holdings ), is a cybersecurity company focused on licensing and enforcement,  developing mobile security applications, providing consulting services, and investing in cybersecurity technologies and intellectual property.  Licensing and enforcement of its cybersecurity technology patent portfolio is operated by its wholly-owned subsidiary Finjan, Inc. ( Finjan ).  The mobile security business is operated by its wholly owned subsidiary Finjan Mobile, Inc., ("Finjan Mobile") and the consulting services business is operated by its wholly-owned subsidiary, CybeRisk Security Solutions LLC ("CybeRisk"). Revenues and operations from the Company's Finjan Mobile security business and the Company's CybeRisk advisory services were deemed immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) can be condensed or omitted. The December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  The information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the year ended   December 31, 2015   which were included in the annual report on Form 10-K filed by the Company on March 25, 2016. 
    
  In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and operating results. The results for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other interim or future periods. 
    
  USE OF ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to stock-based compensation, investments, the determination of the economic useful life of property and equipment, income taxes and valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience or on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
     
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Finjan Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  REVENUE RECOGNITION 
    
  Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product or service has occurred, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. 
    
  Revenue from the Company s cybersecurity business results from grants of licenses to its patented cybersecurity technology and settlements reached from legal enforcement of the Company s patent right. Revenue is recognized when the arrangement with the licensee has been signed and the license has been delivered and made effective, provided the license fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  
    
  The total amount of the consideration received upon any settlement or judgment is allocated to each element based on the fair value of each element. Elements provided in either settlement agreements or judgments include, the value of a license, legal release and interest. Fair value of licensing agreements and royalty revenues, are recognized as revenues in the condensed  
  
   4 

     Table of Contents  

consolidated statement of operations. Elements not related to license agreements and royalty revenue in nature will be reflected in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Legal release as part of a settlement agreement is recognized as a separate line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations when value can be allocated to the legal release. When the Company reaches a settlement with a defendant, no value is allocated to the legal release since the existence of a settlement removes legal standing to bring a claim of infringement, and without a legal claim, the legal release has no economic value. The element that is applicable to interest income will be recorded in other income (expense), net. 
    
  When settlements or judgments are achieved at discounts to the fair value of a license, the Company allocates the full settlement or judgment, excluding specifically named elements as mentioned above, to the value of the license agreement or royalty revenue under the residual method relative to full license fair value prior to the discount.  
    
  FOREIGN CURRENCY 
    
  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, and income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments were deemed immaterial for the periods presented. 
    
  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were immaterial for the periods presented, and are included as general and administrative expense, in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
    
  The Company maintains substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions located in the United States. At times, the Company s cash and cash equivalent balances may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , substantially all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are uninsured. 
    
  SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK 
    
  The Company accounts for the redemption premium and issuance costs on its Series A Preferred stock by recognizing changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusting the carrying value of the security to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method views the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. 
    
  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE 
    
  Basic net loss per common share is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. 
    
  Potentially dilutive common shares from employee equity plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of warrants and share options and were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and consist of the following:

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED  
    
     In August, 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  that addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This ASU addresses the eight specific cash flow issues.  The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, FASB issued   ASU No. 2016-07 "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting"  . The amendments require upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting that no retroactive adjustment of the investment be made. In addition, the amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting, recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Early Adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-08 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)"  . The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .   Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Early adoption is permitted commencing January 1, 2017. Subsequently, in April 2016, the FASB issued   ASU No. 2016-10   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2016-10 ): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   . The amendments add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also improve the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. Public entities should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Early application for public entities is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-09  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   . Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  Other recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

NOTE 2   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Operating Leases 
    
  The following table sets forth the Company s aggregate future minimum payments under its operating lease commitments as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

The Company accounts for its leases under the straight-line method of accounting. Deferred rent payable was   $75,000   and   $80,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in long term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.     
    
  Rent expense was   $188,000   and   $586,000   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $187,000   and   $474,000   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  Rental income, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, was   $88,000   and   $260,000  , respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and   $31,000   for the same periods in 2015. 
    
  Sublease income is recorded as a reduction in rental expense.  Future minimum lease payments to be received under the sublease agreements as of September 30, 2016 are as follows (in thousands): 

Capital Commitments 
    
  On November 21, 2013, the Company made a   $5.0 million   commitment to invest in JVP VII Cyber Strategic Partners, L.P. (the  JVP Fund ), an Israel-based limited partnership venture capital fund seeking to invest in early-stage cyber technology companies. If and when the Company funds the entire amount of the investment, it will be less than a   10%   limited partnership interest in which the Company will not be able to exercise control over the fund. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for this investment under the cost method of accounting.  
    
  On June 8, 2015, the Company received a cash distribution of   $0.8 million   as a portion of a gross entitlement of   $1.3 million   from its investment in the JVP Fund, the remainder   $0.5 million   was reinvested in the fund. Along with its cash investments of   $2.3 million  , it represents a total investment of   $2.8 million  . The distribution is a portion of the gross proceeds allocated to the Company's investment. The retained proceeds did not reduce the Company's future capital commitment to the venture capital fund. The Company has made a   $0.6 million   contribution to the fund during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a   $2.7 million   outstanding capital commitment to the venture capital fund, which can be called any time.

  The components of accrued expenses are as below: 

NOTE 4 - LICENSE, SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE AGREEMENT 
    
  On June 30, 2016, Finjan announced that Finjan and a European cloud-based network security firm ( European Licensee ) had entered into a Confidential Patent License Agreement (the  License Agreement ) effective as of June 30, 2016. Under the License Agreement, European Licensee obtains a nonexclusive, term license in the United States under Finjan s U.S. patents to make, have made, use, sell (directly or indirectly), offer to sell, import, distribute and otherwise dispose of Licensee s covered products. European Licensee paid Finjan   $565,000   in cash on June 30, 2016. 
    
  On June 3, 2016, Finjan entered into a Patent License, Settlement and Release Agreement with Proofpoint, Inc. and Amorize Technologies (collectively,  Proofpoint ).  The Proofpoint license provides for licensee to pay Finjan the sum of    $10.9 million   in cash, in which   $4.3 million   was received on June 6, 2016,   $3.3 million   is payable on or before January 4, 2017, and   $3.3 million   is payable on or before January 3, 2018.  The Company recognized   $4.3 million   of the   $10.9 million   license as revenues as of June 30, 2016, as such amount was determined to be fixed and determinable, in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policy as described in Note 1. The remaining balance of   $6.6 million   under the terms of the June 3, 2016 License will be recognized as revenues when collectability is reasonably assured.  In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant Proofpoint a non-exclusive, irrevocable (except in the case of non-payment by Proofpoint or other material breach), worldwide license under Finjan Patents during the Term as specified in the June 3, 2016 License. 
    
  On December 30, 2015, Finjan entered into a Confidential Patent License, Settlement and Release Agreement ( December 30, 2015 License ), effective December 29, 2015, with a United States-based third party ( U.S. Licensee ).  The December 30, 2015 License provides for U.S. Licensee to pay Finjan the sum of   $3.65 million   in cash, in which   $1.0 million   was received on December 30, 2015,   $1.65 million   was received on June 27, 2016, and   $1.0 million   was received on September 1, 2016.  The Company recognized   $1.0 million   of the   $3.65 million   license as revenues as of December 31, 2015, as such amount was determined to be fixed and determinable, in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policy as described in Note 1. The Company received and recognized   $1.65 million   and   $1 million   as revenues during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively. In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant U.S. Licensee a non-exclusive, irrevocable (except in the case of non-payment by U.S Licensee or other material breach), worldwide license under Finjan Patents during the Term as specified in the December 30, 2015 License. 
    
  On April 7, 2015, Finjan entered into a Confidential Asset Purchase and Patent License Agreement (the  April 7, 2015 License ), effective as of April 7, 2015, with F-Secure Corporation, a company incorporated in Finland ( F-Secure ). The Company recognized   $700,000   of the   $1.0 million   license as revenues as of  September 30, 2015, as such amount was determined to be fixed and determinable, in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policy as described in Note 1. The remaining balance of   $300,000   under the terms of the April 7, 2015 License was recognized as revenues as of March 31, 2016. The April 7, 2015 License also provides for the assignment by F-Secure to Finjan of two patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,474,048 and 7,769,991, including among other things, all progeny applications or patents, foreign counterparts and reissues (the  F-Secure Patents ). The Company has not yet determined if these patents fit into its business model, therefore any value of these patents would be limited to their cost which would be their filing fees, an immaterial amount. As such, the Company has concluded that their value is de minimis. In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant F-Secure a worldwide, fully-paid, non-exclusive field of use license to Finjan patents owned as of the effective date or acquired by Finjan or its affiliates within   two years   from the effective date, as well as to the F-Secure Patents

On September 24, 2014, Finjan entered into a Confidential Patent License, Settlement and Release Agreement (the  September 24, 2014 License ) with a third party against whom Finjan had filed a patent infringement lawsuit.  Pursuant to this September 24, 2014 License, the third party and Finjan also agreed to dismiss the infringement litigation, and each party gave the other a general release for all claims that it might have against the other, known or unknown, based on the actions of either party on or before the date of the settlement.  Under the September 24, 2014 License, the third party will pay Finjan a license fee of   $8.0 million   payable in four installments.

NOTE 5 - SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK 
    
  On May 6, 2016, Finjan entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Halcyon LDRII, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Halcyon LDRII in a private placement an aggregate of   102,000   shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock Shares at a purchase price of   $100.00   per share, for aggregate proceeds of   $10.2 million  . The closing of the Private Placement occurred on May 20, 2016. The Company incurred issuance costs of   $0.7 million   which are recorded as an offset to the redeemable preferred stock. 
    
    The Series A Preferred Stock was accounted under  Section 480-10-S99 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (FASB Accounting Standards Codification 480) as amended by ASU 2009-04 - Accounting for Redeemable Equity Instruments ( ASU 2009-04 ). Under ASU 2009-04, a redeemable equity security is to be classified as temporary equity if it is conditionally redeemable a) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, b) at the option of the holder, or c) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. The Company s financing is redeemable at the option of the holder. Therefore, the Company classified the Series A Preferred Stock as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  The Series A Preferred Stock have redemption features that have a determinable price and determinable date based on the following liquidation preferences: 
    
  The lesser of: 

2.8  x the original purchase price (OPP); or the following: 
       
     1.5  x the OPP if redeemed within 90 days of closing; or 
     1.65  x the OPP if redeemed between 90 and 360 days of closing; or 
     1.75  x the OPP if redeemed between 360 days and 720 days of closing; or 
     Thereafter,   1.75  x the OPP plus   0.1  x the OPP for every 90 day period the preferred remains outstanding. 
    
  The redemption feature is at the option of the holder and is defined in the Certificate of Designation as a percentage of certain revenues, which varies by type of revenue as well as date received. These revenues include monetary awards, damages, fees, recoveries, judgments in a suit, as well as monies received from gross licensing, royalty or similar revenue recovered from JVP related to Finjan s investment in JVP. Such monetary awards are   not solely within the control of Finjan. 
    
  The increase in the redemption value is a deemed dividend that increases the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period with an offsetting decrease to additional paid-in-capital.  
    
  On July 1, 2016, the Company   redeemed   $2.6 million   or   17,286   shares of the Series A Preferred stock;   $1.7 million   reduced the original recorded value of the Series A Preferred stock and   $0.9 million   reduced the accreted value.  
    
  On August 19, 2016, the Company's Series A Preferred liquidation preference increased from   1.50   to   1.65  ; as a result, the Company accreted a dividend of   $1.3 million  . At September 30, 2016, the Series A Preferred stock was   $13.7 million  , net of the July redemption and the Liquidation value was   $14.0 million  . 
    
  Subsequent to quarter end, the Company redeemed   $0.2 million   or   1,212   shares of the Series A Preferred stock;   $0.1 million   reduced the original recorded value of the Series A Preferred stock and   $0.1 million   reduced the accreted value.

NOTE 6   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 
    
  Stock-based Compensation 
    
  On July 10, 2014, the Company s stockholders approved the Finjan Holdings, Inc. 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") at the annual meeting of stockholders, pursuant to which   2,196,836   shares of common stock were authorized for issuance.  On June 24, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Israeli Sub-plan (the  2015 Israeli Sub-plan ) to the Company s 2014 Plan, which enables the Company to grant options, and issue shares of common stock to employees and non-employees, who are employed by the Company or any of its affiliates, who are residents of the State of Israel. 
    
  The Company has issued a total of   836,872   Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") of which   431,747   remain outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  RSUs generally vest over   three   or   four   years, with one-third or one-fourth, respectively, vesting on the one-year anniversary followed by quarterly vesting thereafter.   
    
  Upon shareholder approval of the 2014 Plan, the 2013 Global Share Option Plan and Israeli Sub-Plan were terminated, other than respect to options outstanding under such plans.   1,718,832   options remain outstanding under the 2013 and 2014 plans as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees are recognized as expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award (determined using Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and intrinsic value for RSUs), and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting of the equity awards). Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant estimates and judgments, including future employee stock option exercise behavior and requisite service periods. 
    
  During the three and nine  months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company expensed   $229,000   and   $682,000  , respectively, and   $187,000   and   $642,000   for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, of stock-based compensation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. All stock-based compensation expenses were selling, general and administration related. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of   September 30, 2016   was   $0  . 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase   zero   and   295,000   shares of common stock, respectively.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted   zero   and   200,000   RSUs of common stock, respectively.  
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   zero   and   20,000   RSUs were forfeited, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   zero   and   20,000   options were forfeited, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the weighted-average grant date fair value of the option awards for the periods presented were as follows: 

There were no grants issued in the current quarter. 
    
  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates with maturities similar to the expected term of the option. The volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s share price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate and was based on historical volatility of comparative companies that are similar to the Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company updated its volatility assumptions to reflect the increased trading history in the Company s stock.     The expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the option. The dividend yield is   0%   as the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not anticipate paying dividends in the future.  

NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  In the course of business, the Company obtains legal services from a firm in which the Company s Chairman is a partner.

Symantec filed an Amended Answer on October 31, 2014, removing its Fourteenth Affirmative Defense of unenforceability. Both parties have demanded a jury trial.  This matter is assigned to the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr., United States District Judge.  A claim construction or Markman Hearing was heard on June 29, 2015. On July 3, 2015, Symantec filed petitions for   Inter Partes   Review ( IPR ) before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( PTAB ) for all asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,015,182, 8,141,154, 7,757,289, 7,930,299, and 7,756,996.  On September 10, 2015, Symantec filed a total of   11   IPR petitions for all asserted claims of asserted patents.  On August 20, 2015, Symantec filed a motion to stay the case pending completion of these   eight   IPR petitions.  The motion was heard on October 1, 2015 and on October 9, 2015, the Court stayed the case pending the PTAB s decision on whether to institute IPR of the claims that are the subject of Symantec s petitions. On January 14, 2016, the PTAB denied institution of   six   IPRs of   five   asserted patents.  On January 21, 2016, the parties filed a joint status report giving the Court an update regarding the status of the IPR petitions.  On February 26, 2016 the PTAB denied institution of an additional   two   IPRs filed on separate patents, denying a total of   eight   petitions as of February 26, 2016. On March 11, 2016 the PTAB denied   two   more IPR's on patents against Symantec, denying a total of   10   petitions to date. On March 18, 2016, the PTAB granted institution on the 11th Petition by Symantec, relating to the  494 Patent (IPR2015-01892).  On March 29, 2016, the parties jointly requested the Court lift the stay, and on March 30, 2016, the Court lifted the stay.  On April 15, 2016, the parties jointly submitted a proposed schedule to the Court for the remainder of the case. On August 1, 2016 the Court issued a Scheduling Order indicating a timeline to trial but without specifically identifying a trial date.  On August 31, 2016, the parties filed a joint stipulation requesting that the Court set a date for a settlement conference.  To date, the Court has not scheduled a settlement conference.  On August 25, 2016, Symantec filed an administrative motion requesting leave

to submit supplemental authority regarding various claim construction issues and requesting the Court take judicial notice of statements made during and in connection with the IPR proceedings.  Finjan opposed the motion on August 28, 2016.  On August 24, 2016, Finjan filed a request that the Court take judicial notice of the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board s ( PTAB ) construction of certain claim terms in connection with its denial to institute inter partes review with respect to the  926 and  494 Patents.  On August 25, 2016, Finjan filed a request that the Court take judicial notice of the PTAB s construction of certain claims in connection with its granting-in-part of inter partes review of the  494 Patent and denial of inter partes review of the  926 Patent.  Following a hearing on November 3, 2016, the Court granted the Motion and ordered the parties to file a joint statement by no later than November 11, 2016, proposing an expedited schedule for disclosures, briefs, and a Markman hearing if "deemed necessary by the Court".

  Finjan filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Palo Alto Networks, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on November 4, 2014, asserting that Palo Alto Networks is directly and indirectly infringing certain claims of Finjan s U.S. Patent Nos. 6,804,780, 6,965,968, 7,058,822, 7,418,731, 7,613,918, 7,613,926, 7,647,633, 8,141,154, 8,225,408, and 8,677,494, through the manufacture, use, importation, sale, and/or offer for sale of its products and services, including but not limited to  Next-Generation Security Platform, Next-Generation Firewall, Virtualized Firewall, WildFire Subscription, WildFire Platform, URL Filtering Subscription, Threat Prevention Subscription, and Advanced EndPoint Protection. Palo Alto Networks failed to timely respond to the Complaint and Finjan submitted an application for Entry of Default.  On Palo Alto Networks  request, Finjan stipulated to an extension of time for Palo Alto Networks to respond. The principal parties in this proceeding are Finjan and Palo Alto Networks. Finjan seeks entry of judgment that Palo Alto Networks has infringed and is infringing the above-listed patents, and has induced infringement and is inducing infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,804,780, 6,965,968, 7,058,822, 7,418,731, 7613,918, 7,613,926, 7,647,633, 8,141,154, 8,225,408, and 8,677,494, a preliminary and permanent injunction from infringing, or inducing the infringement the same patents, an accounting of all infringing sales and revenues, damages of no less than a reasonable royalty consistent with proof, and enhanced damages for willful infringement, costs, interest, and reasonable attorneys  fees under 35 U.S.C.  285.  Palo Alto Networks filed its Answer and Counterclaims on December 31, 2015, by denying Finjan's allegations of infringement and counterclaiming that the asserted patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C.    101, 102, 103 and/or 112. Both parties have demanded a jury trial.  On October 8, 2015, the Honorable Edward M. Chen recused himself from the case and requested the case be reassigned to another judge.  Also on October 8, 2015, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Phyllis J. Hamilton in the Oakland division of the District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 25, 2015, Palo Alto Networks filed a petition for IPR before the PTAB of U.S. Patent No. 8,141,154.  On September 30, 2015, Palo Alto Networks filed petitions for IPR of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,058,822, 7,418,731, 7,647,633 and 8,225,408. On November 4, 2015, Palo Alto Networks filed a IPR petition of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,613,926.  On November 5, 2015, Palo Alto Networks filed IPR petitions of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,965,968 and 8,141,154.  On November 6, 2015, Palo Alto Networks filed IPR petitions of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,804,780, 7,613,918, 8,225,408 and 8,667,494.  On December 10, 2015, the matter was stayed pending a decision by the PTAB on whether to institute IPR of Finjan's claims of its   ten   patents asserted against Palo Alto Networks.  On March 21, 2016, the PTAB instituted trial on claims 1-8, 10 and 11 of the  154 Patent, and on April 20, 2016, the PTAB instituted trial on the same claims from a separate petition. On March 29, 2016, the PTAB instituted trial on the  408 Patent, claims 14 and 19 of the  633 Patent, and denied institution of trial on all other challenged claims of the  633 Patent, and all challenged claims of the  822 Patent and the  731 Patent.  On May 9, 2016, the PTAB denied institution of trial on the  926 Patent, the  968 Patent, the  780 Patent, and the  918 Patent.  On May 13, 2016, the PTAB instituted trial on the  494 Patent.  On May 26, 2016, the Court ordered the stay to remain in effect until the PTAB s final determination of the instituted IPRs.  There can be no assurance that Finjan will be successful in settling or litigating these claims.

  Inter Partes   Reexamination Proceedings: 
    
  As defined by the USPTO, an   Inter Partes   Reexamination is a  proceeding in which any person who is not the patent owner and is not otherwise estopped may request examination of a U.S. Patent issued from an original application filed on or after November 29, 1999, based on one or more prior patents or printed publications. Both patent owner and third party requester have participation rights throughout the proceeding, including appeal rights.  Effective September 16, 2012, the American Invents Act (AIA) replaced   Inter Partes   Reexaminations with proceedings referred to as post-grant review and   Inter     Partes   Review (IPR). Post-grant proceedings are generally available immediately after patent issuance.  For patents filed under the pre-AIA first to invent rules (  i.e.  , applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, IPRs can be initiated immediately following issuance of patent.  For patents examined under the AIA first-to-file rules (  i.e.  , applications filed on or after March 16, 2013), IPRs can be initiated after the nine-month window of eligibility for post-grant review.

  Inter Partes   Review Proceedings: 
  As defined by the USPTO,   Inter Partes   Review (IPR) is a trial proceeding conducted at the Patent and Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB or Board) to review the patentability of one or more claims in a patent only on a ground that could be raised under    102 or 103, and only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications. For first-inventor-to-file patents IPR process begins with a third party (a person who is not the owner of the patent) filing a petition after the later of either: (1) nine months after the grant of the patent or issuance of a reissue patent; or (2) if a post grant review is instituted, the termination of the post grant review. These deadlines do not apply to first-to-invent patents. The patent owner may file a preliminary response to the petition. An IPR may be instituted upon a showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least one claim challenged. If the proceeding is instituted and not dismissed, a final determination by the Board will be issued within one year (extendable for good cause by six months). The procedure for conducting IPR     took effect on September 16, 2012, and applies to any patent issued before, on, or after September 16, 2012.

Overview 
    
  We operate a cybersecurity business, focused on licensing and enforcement, developing mobile security applications, providing advisory services, and investing in emerging cybersecurity technologies and intellectual property. 
    
  Continuing Operations 
    
  We operate our cybersecurity business through wholly-owned subsidiaries including, Finjan, Finjan Mobile and CybeRisk. 
    
  Through Finjan, we own a portfolio of patents, related to software and hardware technologies that proactively detect malicious code and thereby protect end users from identity and data theft, spyware, malware, phishing, trojans and other web and network threats. Founded in 1997, Finjan developed and patented technologies that are capable of detecting previously unknown and emerging threats on a real-time, behavior-based, basis, in contrast to signature-based methods of intercepting only known threats to computers. The older signature-based methods, were standard in the web and network security industry during the 1990s. As the web and endpoint security industries - known as cybersecurity - have transitioned to behavior-based detection of malicious code, we believe that our patented technologies continue to be widely used by third parties in a number of market segments. We intend to maximize the economic benefits of our technologies through further licensing and to broaden our technologies and patent holdings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. 
    
  As a core element of our continued patent licensing and enforcement business, our management team, having expertise with technology and intellectual property ("IP") monetization, monitors a number of markets and assesses and observes the adoption of our patented technologies in these markets.  Our management team, in conjunction with outside legal, technical, and financial experts concludes on a case-by-case basis whether or not they believe that Finjan s patented technologies are being used.  Based on these observations, we continue to believe our patented technologies are highly relevant in specific cybersecurity technology areas including, but not limited to, endpoint/cloud software, web gateway/internet infrastructure, and networking equipment markets. From that basis, the Company pursues unlicensed entities through licensing, assertion of claims or both to preserve the value of our portfolio in general. This also reinforces the value to existing licensees of the Finjan patent portfolio. 
    
  Since the sale of its hardware and software operations in 2009, Finjan s primary source of income and related cash flows has been the enforcement of its patent rights against unauthorized use and, to a lesser extent, income derived from intellectual property licenses granted to third parties for the use of patented technologies that are owned by Finjan. 
    
  Finjan Mobile was founded to ensure that mobile devices are protected against spies, phishing and malware attacks. Given the uptrend in mobile device usage coupled with the amount of transient corporate data, the average mobile user presents and represents higher risks of data loss through hacking. The consumer mobile device has become so convenient that consumers often ignore online security and download apps and blindly agree to terms of service, purchase products, pay bills, connect to free Wi-Fi, and not think twice about personal data and photos stored on their devices. As such, in June of 2015, the Company initiated research and development of security products for mobile devices benefiting from technologies developed and patented by Finjan. 
    
  CybeRisk was founded in 2015 to deliver global advanced cyber risk and cyber security advisory services. Through a team of employees and consultants, based in North America, Europe and the Middle East, CybeRisk assesses corporate risk exposure and delivers appropriate mitigation strategies. Its unique and focused offering positions CybeRisk as the piece that interconnects the "server room to the board room". 
    
  As of  September 30, 2016, we had 12 employees. We intend to hire or engage additional full-time professionals, employees, and/or consultants in alignment with our growth strategy. Although the market is highly competitive for attracting and retaining highly qualified professionals in our industry, we continue our endeavor to find such candidates for our Company. Our management team and additional personnel that we may hire in the future will be primarily responsible for executing and implementing our licensing and enforcement strategy, including analyzing licensing and enforcement opportunities, making tactical decisions related to our strategy, identifying new applications for our existing cybersecurity technologies and pursuing opportunities to invest in new technologies through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.

Industry Trends and Outlook 
    
  We believe that 2016 and 2017 may again be active years for patent law reform although intellectual property does not seem to be a key issue during the current presidential election cycle.  We believe that proponents of patent law reform, largely made up of an individual or coalitions of powerful technology corporations continue to seek severe statutory limitations on how companies - specifically those who own patents and do not make product covered by such patents - can enforce their patents against companies who make products.  The U.S. Congress is considering proposals from all constituents. In an effort to ensure fair and balanced protections for all good faith patent owners, our executives have dedicated time and resources to actively educate our lawmakers and existing and prospective stakeholders on how certain proposed reforms could harm individual inventors, startups, small companies, the licensing industry and therefore, U.S. innovation and the U.S. economy as a whole. 
    
  Further, since the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ("AIA") on September 16, 2011, several aspects of the patent law have been interpreted by the courts, including what constitutes patentable subject matter, inducement of infringement, and (attorney) fee-shifting to the non-prevailing party in the context of litigation, among other issues.  Moreover, under AIA, patents previously granted by the USPTO may be reviewed through post-patent grant proceedings such as reexamination or IPR.  It is becoming a trend, if not a practice, for accused infringers to petition for reexaminations or IPRs of asserted patents as these proceedings may give the petitioner  two bites at the apple.   The outcome of the proceedings can range from decisions favorable to the patent holder, favorable to both parties, or favorable to the petitioner.  If the outcome is the latter, the value of the challenged patent can be materially reduced or extinguished.  Thus, patent rights, including enforcement of such rights against unauthorized use is inherently subject to uncertainties. 
    
  We also believe cybersecurity issues will again be a very active sector in 2017. Cybersecurity is not just another technology but a critical business issue that intersects government, corporations and individual citizens.  We have recently seen a number of devastatingly successful cybersecurity breaches targeting high profile government offices and corporations. The full extent of the cost and damage associated with these attacks may not be known for some time. Nonetheless, these attacks are expected to continue, along with their associated and sometimes unprecedented costs.  In many cases, it is not just the government or corporation that suffers losses or damages but their clients and customers, who can also fall victim by the breach of their personal and otherwise confidential data.  These issues have forced both government and corporations to take a serious look at their vulnerabilities, which will lead to increased spending on cybersecurity infrastructure, including hardware and software, as well as cybersecurity consulting services. 

Future Growth Strategy 
    
  Our mission, for the foreseeable future, is to build a diversified cybersecurity company benefiting from historical investments in technology and patents while expanding into new product and services offerings. We believe our patented technologies continue to hold significant value and we intend to vigorously protect our investment, the value of our existing licensees  investments, and the value that technology and intellectual property represents for our shareholders. We are pursuing and will continue to pursue our growth through the following strategies: 

Develop and Expand Existing Patent Portfolio -   We have obtained and endeavor to continue to obtain new patents relating to security technologies through research and development and/or acquisition in the cybersecurity space. For example, on: 

26 

     Table of Contents  

Subsequent to quarter end, on October 5, 2016 Finjan was issued European Patent No. EP 1 810 152 B1 covering method and system for adaptive rule-based contents scanners; 

Additionally  , as part of the consideration for granting a patent license to F-Secure in April 2015, we acquired two of  F-Secure s patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,474,048 and 7,769,991, including among other things, all progeny applications or patents, foreign counterparts and reissues) that are complementary to our existing patent portfolio. 

Invest in Internal Research   Development through Finjan Mobil  e - We continue to pursue internal research and development of security technologies that both relate to Finjan's existing patented inventions as well as new concepts to meet an ever expanding market need.  Since we do not yet have sufficient internal personnel to engage in large-scale research and development, we currently operate this business with limited internal staff focused on strategy and market development while software development is completed under contract with external developers. Products currently available and in development include Finjan Mobile Secure Browser and next generation multi-factor authentication security applications utilizing geo-location techniques on mobile devices.  The Company continues to explore inorganic growth and acquisition opportunities to complement the vision for Finjan Mobile. In October of  2016, Finjan Mobile launched Gen3 of its mobile secure browser, VitalSecurity   TM   . FinjanMobile s VitalSecurity Browser, which offers browser functionality and analysis of malware threats from top virus companies. Importantly while it offers full transparency to a user s browser experience, it also guards privacy by not collecting any data. It features Touch ID and passcode security to further protect a user s devices. 

Continue to Develop and Invest in CybeRisk   - CybeRisk provides services to enterprise customers on a wide variety of threats, current and future issues, and prevention. CybeRisk's advisory services enable customers to accelerate the maturity of their cyber security posture and are intended to augment a company's own security and risk capabilities. We intend to further invest in CybeRisk and grow our cybersecurity advisory services business. This could include one or more of the following: the hiring of additional qualified personnel, and the expansion of the business globally from its current headquarters in Tel Aviv. 

Expand our IP Assets through Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships -   We intend to acquire and develop new technologies and invest in intellectual property through strategic partnerships, acquisitions of technology-focused companies, IP portfolios or other assets and other initiatives. We endeavor to identify relevant security technologies and patents that have been, or are anticipated to be, widely adopted by third parties in connection with the manufacture or sale of products and services, and to which we can bring enforcement actions (i.e., licensing or litigation) and other expertise. We may also broaden our technology and patent holdings by working with inventors and universities, acquiring technology companies, investing in research laboratories, start-ups, and by creating strategic partnerships with companies, large and small, seeking to effectively and efficiently monetize their technology and patent assets. While we anticipate that we will initially focus on acquisitions and strategic partnerships involving technologies relating to network, web and endpoint cybersecurity, we may seek to diversify to a broader market in the future. Our experience with monetizing both technologies and patents may be considered valuable by potential acquisition candidates and strategic partners who may lack resources or know-how to effectively and efficiently generate a return for those investments. 

Continue to Demonstrate Best Practices in Pursuing Licensing Relationships and Enforcing our Patent Rights -   In March 2014, we adopted Best Practices to demonstrate our commitment to ethical, transparent and consistent business practices for intellectual property licensing. We called upon and continue to promote industry-wide adoption of a set of best practices, through leadership organizations such as the Licensing Executive Society and the Open Register of Patent Owners that support technological advancements, investments in innovation, and continued job creation while protected by a robust patent system.  We intend to continue pursuing a proactive campaign that adheres to our best practices guidelines while rigorously protecting our intellectual property rights. We have entered into preliminary discussions with numerous potential licensees in accordance with these Best Practices, but acknowledge that it takes many discussions and many months for preliminary discussions to culminate in a license agreement, if at all.  While it is our preference to resolve our patent-related disputes through amicable business solutions, protecting the value of our patented technology is paramount. 
       
  Although we currently pursue growth initiatives through the above strategies, unforeseen market and industry conditions and new developments may necessitate changes in our strategies. We intend to remain resilient, flexible, and open to new opportunities that benefit our shareholders.

Comparability to Future Results 
    
  We have set forth below selected factors that we believe have had, or can be expected to have, a significant effect on the comparability of our recent or future results. In addition to the factors described below, please see Item 1A.  Risk Factors  for additional factors that may affect our operating results. 
    
  Fluctuations of Income, Expenses and Cash Flows Related to Licensing and Enforcement 
    
  Our licenses and Judgments may not be recurring, and are not necessarily indicative of the income or cash flows that we expect to generate in the future from our existing technology portfolio or otherwise. We expect income, expenses and cash flows related to patent enforcement to be unpredictable and to fluctuate significantly from period to period. A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect the timing and amount of our income and cash flows related to patent licensing and enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, trial dates, the strength of our claims and likelihood of achieving an acceptable license on settlement, the timing and nature of any appeals and our ability to collect on any favorable Judgments. Significant fluctuations in our income and cash flows may make our business difficult to manage and adversely affect our business and operating results. We do not recognize income from our licensing and enforcement actions until the terms are fixed and determinable or litigation is finalized (whether resolved at trial or in a settlement). 
    
  Our expenses, principally with respect to litigation costs, may also vary significantly from period to period depending upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, whether fees of outside legal counsel are paid on an hourly, contingent or other basis, the timing of depositions, discovery and other elements of litigation, costs of expert witnesses and other consultants, and other costs incurred in support of enforcement actions. 
    
  As a result of the factors described above and other known and unknown risks affecting our business, our historical operating performance may not be indicative of our future results. 
    
  Stock-Based and Other Executive Compensation 
    
  Our Board of Directors has adopted the Finjan Holdings 2014 Incentive Plan ( 2014 Plan ), which our shareholders approved at our 2014 annual meeting of stockholders on July 10, 2014, pursuant to which 2,196,836 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance. A total of 431,747 restricted stock units and 1,718,832 options remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016, under the 2013 and 2014 Plans. We expect that future equity-based awards will continue to be made under the 2014 Plan to our directors, officers and other employees and consultants. As a result, to the extent relevant, we may incur non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses in future periods that may not be comparable to past periods. 
    
  We continue to increase the number of our employees to help execute our strategy in the cybersecurity business and support our public company functions, and expect to hire additional employees in both capacities.  Accordingly, we will continue to incur compensation expenses in future periods that we did not incur during the historical period presented in our financial statements. 

Results of Operations 
    
  The Company's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1.1 million and $10.0 million respectively, increased by $1.1 million, and $9.3 million, compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The year-to-date revenue of $10.0 million includes, $4.3 million from a June 2016 license agreement, $2.6 million from a December 2015 license agreement and $2.0 million from a September 2014 license agreement. Revenue is determined by the timing of licensing agreements or litigation settlements and can vary period to period. At this time, we recognize revenue as future payments become fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  
    
  The Company has not yet recorded $7.6 million in revenues for outstanding license agreements nor $55 million related to favorable judgment orders from court actions (See Note 8 - Litigation, Claims and Assessments) that are expected to be resolved during 2017 and 2018 respectively.  

28 

     Table of Contents  

The Company's costs of goods sold of $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.1 million, from $0.1 million in the same period ended September 30, 2015. There was no cost of goods in the September quarters in either year. The Company accrues and/or recognizes cost of goods sold upfront when initially recognizing a new agreement, while a portion of the revenue is recognized when it becomes fixed and determinable, often over several quarters.  As a result, revenue was recognized in the current quarter while the cost associated with the entire license agreement was recognized upfront at the time the Company was obligated to pay it. 
    
  Research and development expenses were $0.3 million and $0.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 50% and 0% as compared to $0.2 million and $0.4 million in the same periods ended September 30, 2015. The Company s focus on research and development consisted primarily of professional services associated with the development of mobile security application products. The Company plans to accelerate its efforts in security application products, including mobile. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively, a decrease of 7% or $0.3 million and 16% or $2.1 million, respectively, as compared to $4.5 million and $13.1 million in the same periods ended September 30, 2015. These expenses consist primarily of accounting, legal and other professional fees including stock-based compensation. The largest expenses are related to litigation and headcount. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, litigation expenses were $1.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, as compared to $2.1 million and $6.9 million of expense in the same periods ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to reduced litigation expenses which vary based on the timing of the various outstanding actions (See Note 8 - Litigation, Claims and Assessments). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, headcount expense of $1.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, decreased $0.1 million and $0.5 million compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2015. This is primarily due to the reduction of two employees. Headcount expense includes stock-based compensation of $0.2 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $0.2 million and $0.6 million in the same periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Operation related expenses remained flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. 
    
  Return on investment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0, down from $1.3 million from the same period ended September 30, 2015 and was due to a distribution from our investment in the JVP Fund in 2015, which represented a portion of the gross proceeds allocated to the Company s investment. There was no return on investment in the September quarters in either year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our cash requirements are, and will continue to be, dependent upon a variety of factors. We expect to continue devoting significant capital resources to the litigations in process and any other litigation we pursue.  We also expect to require significant capital resources to maintain our issued patents, prosecute our patent applications, acquire new technologies as part of our growth strategy, and attract and retain qualified personnel on a full-time basis. 
    
  In addition, on November 21, 2013, we made a $5 million commitment to invest in an innovation fund through JVP to invest in early-stage cyber technology companies, of which $2.7 million of the commitment remains unfunded. The fund can make a call on our remaining $2.7 million commitment at any time.  We expect to make payments to honor this commitment if and when capital calls are made by the fund. We have sufficient cash on hand to fund such obligations. 
    
  The Company leases its corporate headquarters office in Silicon Valley, and offices in New York, New York, Menlo Park, California and Tel Aviv, Israel. Under the terms of the four leases, the Company owes minimum lease obligations of $1.5 million over the remaining life of the leases, of which $0.9 million is for the Silicon Valley headquarters lease. During 2015 the Company entered into subleases for each of the Menlo Park and New York offices for essentially the remaining duration of the leases. As of September 30, 2016, the total future minimum lease payments to be received under the Menlo Park and New York subleases was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, principally historical and future proceeds from licenses, settlements and judgments in connection with our patent enforcement and licensing activities, as well as the Series A Preferred Stock Financing in May, 2016. We raised approximately $9.5 million from the Series A Preferred Stock Financing, net of issuance costs. Redemptions are tied, at the option of the holder, to future proceeds from licensing and enforcement activities and are subject to dividends accreted to the investors over time, both as defined in the Certificate of Designation.  The first redemption occurred  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

during the quarter end September 30, 2016, when we redeemed $2.6 million or 17,286 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock; $1.7 million reduced the value of the Series A Preferred stock and $0.9 million reduced the accretive value of the Series A Preferred Stock. At September 30, 2016, the Liquidation Preference was $14.0 million.   
    
  Finjan licensing agreements provide for installment payments totaling $7.6 million through January 2018, comprised of $4.3 million due first quarter of 2017 and $3.3 million due first quarter of 2018.  $55 million related to favorable court actions (See Note 8 - Litigation, Claims and Assessments) are expected to be resolved during 2017 and 2018. Based on expected revenue to be received from outstanding license agreements, we may have to make redemption payments of $2.2 million and $1.7 million in 2017 and in 2018, respectively. Enforcement activities that are expected to conclude in 2017 would result in full redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in 2017. 
  The amount and timing of cash flows from our licensing and enforcement activities are subject to uncertainties stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the rates of adoption of our patented technologies, the success of our licensing efforts and the outcome of enforcement actions. As a result, our income and cash flows may vary significantly from period to period.  
    
  Based on current forecasts and assumptions, management believes that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing this quarterly report. Such forecasts include approximately $4.3 million of licensing revenue to be received by January 13, 2017 under existing contracts. We may, however, encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. To ensure against any such difficulties, we may raise additional capital to fund licensing and enforcement actions, planned research and development activities and to better solidify our financial position. Any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through issuances of equity or debt, or other external financing. However, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Further, if the Company is unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, the Company may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of its business plans. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $11.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.3 million of working capital. The increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.5 million to $11.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $6.1 million at December 31, 2015, is attributable to $7.0 million received from financing activities, offset by $1.0 million used in operations and $0.5 million used in investing activities. 
    
    Cash flows from     Operating Activities  :   
    
  Net cash used in Finjan s operating activities of $1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily due to the net loss of $3.6 million offset by $0.7 million of stock-based compensation and $1.9 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities of $10.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to our net loss of $11.5 million and the non-cash return on investment of $1.3 million, offset by $0.6 million of stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
    
    Cash used in Investing Activities  :  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities of $0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily related to the purchase of additional investment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, made up of investment proceeds, net of the additional investment offset by the  purchase of property and equipment.  
    
  Cash provided by   Financing Activities  :   
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities was $7.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily resulted from the Series A Preferred Stock Financing in May 2016, net of redemptions. Redemptions are tied, at the option of the holder, to future proceeds and are subject to dividends accreted to the investors over time, both as defined in the Certificate of Designation.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our holdings of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016, totaled $11.6 million and consisted primarily of cash and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the United States. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden change in market interest rates of 10% would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management evaluated, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Philip Hartstein, and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Michael D. Noonan, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of  September 30, 2016, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
    Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
    
  Our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, has designed our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurances that the controls  objectives will be met. However, management does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Finjan Holdings, Inc. have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any system s design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of a system s control effectiveness into future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
