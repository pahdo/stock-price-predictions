NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Organization 

We were organized as a Nevada corporation on August 25, 1999. On August 15, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to combine our business and activities (the "Merger") with CannaSys, Inc., a privately held Colorado corporation focused on providing services to the cannabis industry ("CannaSys-Colorado"). CannaSys-Colorado was originally formed on October 4, 2013, as a limited liability company, and converted to a corporation on June 26, 2014. Under the terms of the merger agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary formed to effectuate the Merger was merged with and into CannaSys-Colorado, the surviving entity, which then became our wholly owned subsidiary.

Due to the CannaSys-Colorado shareholders controlling us after the Merger, CannaSys-Colorado was considered the accounting acquirer. The transaction was therefore recognized as a reverse acquisition of us by CannaSys-Colorado. The accompanying condensed financial statements are those of CannaSys-Colorado for all periods prior to the Merger.

In connection with the closing of the Merger and after meeting the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), on November 12, 2014, we filed amended and restated articles of incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State that: (i) changed our name to CannaSys, Inc.; (ii) increased our authorized capital stock to 80,000,000 shares, consisting of 75,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock; (iii) authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock; and (iv) made other modernizing, nonmaterial changes to our articles of incorporation. Changing our corporate name to CannaSys, Inc. was a condition to the Merger transaction. The name change better reflects the nature of our principal business operations and it became effective in the OTC market on December 2, 2014, when FINRA announced the name change. We have also received a new CUSIP number and our trading symbol was changed to "MJTK."

Nature of Business 

We provide technology services in the ancillary space of the cannabis industry. We do not produce, sell, or handle in any manner cannabis products. As the current cannabis industry grows and gains momentum around the country, technology needs for the industry have been largely underserved. Our focus on this niche element of the industry creates many efficient and profitable tools for both industry owners and consumers.

Since inception, we have developed, refined, and introduced branded products, membership loyalty programs, text-message-based platforms for customer engagement, and laboratory management systems into the cannabis industry. To support marketing and delivery of our principal products and to access other products and services, we are expanding a network of strategic alliances within the industry to build an array of product and service offerings and to increase use of our distribution channels. Most of our active strategic relationships were only recently initiated and are yet to generate revenue.

We seek funding to launch our integrated cannabis-industry product and service suite. Our primary business objectives are to generate stable revenues and cash flows through the development of vertically integrated distribution centers and to collect and monetize cannabis consumer data.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Unaudited Interim Financial Information 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control, and preventing and detecting fraud. Our system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that: (i) recorded transactions are valid; (ii) valid transactions are recorded; and (iii) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements that present fairly our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the respective periods being presented.

Revenue Recognition 

We follow  Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (" ASC") 605-10-S99-1,   Revenue Recognition,   for revenue recognition. We will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805).  Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition, an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We do not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

7 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC 840,  Leases (FAS 13) . ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our financial statements.

We have reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Based on that review, these pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN

As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we had a net loss of $ 3,516,144  and used cash in operating activities of $ 307,860 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . We had an accumulated deficit of $9,132,830 as of September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

While we are attempting to increase operations and revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of debt and equity financing. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate increased revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate increased revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate increased revenues. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 4 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment, stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, consisted of the following:

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we disposed of $8,403 of office furniture we were no longer using, resulting in a loss on disposal of $3,766.

Depreciation Expense 

Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $13,824 and $2,103, respectively.

NOTE 5 SOFTWARE LICENSE

Effective February 12, 2015, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Loyl.Me LLC, an established provider of automated marketing and customer relationship management software. The licensing agreement allows us the opportunity for perpetual and exclusive rights and ability to provide the cannabis community a convenient, cost-effective, and streamlined technology that is widely used in the non-cannabis industry. The technology is being branded as "BumpUp Rewards." The term of the agreement is perpetual; therefore, no amortization is being recognized. However, the value of the license will undergo an annual impairment test as required by ASC 350,   Intangibles Goodwill and Other  . The agreement requires nine installment payments of $25,000 each to be paid with a combination of cash and stock and 8% of revenue from the use of the licensed technology. A t December 31, 2015, we performed an impairment analysis and determined there had been no impairment to the value of the software license as recorded on the balance sheet.

On October 3, 2016, we entered into an agreement to terminate the license agreement as it was no longer a core part of our daily business operations. Because of the termination, the software license is fully impaired resulting in a loss of $255,000.

NOTE 6 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

On December 10, 2015, we acquired a 1.083% interest in Duby, LLC for $32,500. Duby is a social media application focused on cannabis consumers. As part of the acquisition, Duby plans to assist in the promotion of our products and services on its platform. We purchased the interest in Duby as part of ongoing negotiations for the joint marketing and promotion of our respective products. The purchase is being accounted for according to ASC 320,  Debt and Equity Securities , as available-for-sale securities and has been recorded at cost. As Duby is not a public company with active trading by which the investment could be valued at December 31, 2015, we performed an impairment analysis and determined that as of December 31, 2015, there had been no impairment to the value of the purchased interest in Duby.

NOTE 7 INVESTMENT IN MHB

On November 10, 2015, we entered into an agreement to exchange 500,000 shares of our common stock for 10 million shares of MHB, Inc., doing business as Mile High Brands ("MHB").  The shares were valued at $5.80 per share, the closing stock price on the date of grant, for a total of $2,900,000.  Through this transaction, we acquired 49% of the issued and outstanding common shares of MHB. MHB is a lifestyle branding agency focused on the regulated cannabis industry. Its clients include celebrities and product companies that wish to access the rapidly growing cannabis marketplace. The purchase is being accounted for according to ASC 320,  Debt and Equity Securities , under the equity method of accounting.  A t December 31, 2015, we performed an impairment analysis of our investment in MHB. We utilized a perpetuity-based valuation model to determine a discounted cash flow and terminal value for MHB's business. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the value of the investment was impaired and that the current fair value is $1,049,475. We recorded an impairment loss on investment of $1,846,515 as of December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we performed another impairment analysis of our investment in MHB. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the value of the investment was again impaired and that the current fair value is now $450,000. We have recorded an impairment loss on investment of $599,475 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, this investment is valued at $450,000 net of total impairment of $2,445,990.

NOTE 15 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In accordance with ASC 855-10,  Subsequent Events   we have analyzed our operations subsequent to September 30, 2016, through the date the financial statements were available to be issued and have determined that we do not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements other than the following.

On October 17, 2016, we completed a recapitalization of our company, consisting of a 20-to-one reverse split and an increase of authorized capitalization to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

On November 4, 2016, pursuant to a note purchase and assignment agreement dated October 31, 2016, B44 LLC agreed to assign its two promissory notes ($50,000 issued on September 6, 2015 and $75,000 issued on January 13, 2016) to an unaffiliated accredited investor. Under the note purchase and assignment agreement, the accredited investor paid $25,000 to B44 and has the option to purchase B44's remaining interest in the notes in four additional tranches of $25,000 each in its sole discretion. As part of this transaction, we issued a replacement convertible promissory note to the accredited investor that provides for interest at 2% per annum and conversion of any amounts funded by the replacement note into shares of CannaSys common stock in accordance with its terms. The principal sum and related interest due to the holder shall be prorated based on the number of tranches actually acquired by the holder from B44.

On November 4, 2016, an accredited investor funded $25,000, the first tranche of an 8% Convertible Promissory Note up to $137,500 under the Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor. We received $23,000, less $2,000 retained by the accredited investor for its legal fees and expenses. The Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory Note provide for funding up to $137,500, in tranches of $25,000 each, with additional tranches in the sole discretion of the accredited investor, resulting in funding up to $125,000 with total original issue discounts of $12,500 pro rated per tranche under the note. The outstanding amounts funded under the convertible note are convertible into shares of our common stock in accordance with its terms.

Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we issued shares of common stock in conversion of principal on our outstanding convertible notes as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors discussed elsewhere in this report.

Certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward-looking statements, such as statements relating to our anticipated revenues, estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, future performance and operations, sources of liquidity, and financing sources. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of the words "believe," "may," "could," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "propose," "plan," "intend," and similar words and expressions. Statements that describe our future strategic goals, plans, objectives, and predictions are also forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking information is based on present circumstances and on our predictions respecting events that have not occurred, that may not occur, or that may occur with different consequences from those now assumed or anticipated. Readers of this report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements, including those regarding us or our management's current beliefs, expectations, anticipations, estimations, projections, strategies, proposals, plans, or intentions, are not guarantees of future performance or results of events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results or events to be materially different from those discussed in this report.

Overview

We create, develop, and commercialize innovative solutions for the expanding medical and recreational cannabis community. Our solutions enhance customer service and provider efficiency, including customer loyalty software applications; create producer and retailer opportunities through the distribution of our own retail brands; and assist with marketing and branding for product companies. We do not grow, distribute, or sell cannabis or products containing cannabis.

18 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

We believe there is a trend toward legalizing medical and recreational use of cannabis. If and as additional states across the nation legalize medical or recreational use and develop regulatory schemes, we believe a commercial cannabis industry will be established. We seek to apply and exploit our knowledge and experience to introduce products for this emerging industry, which continues to encounter resistance from many traditional, integral service providers of loyalty programs, payment methods, wholesale supply, supply management and delivery, and similar items. We believe the resistance or reluctance of others to enter the cannabis industry provides, at least temporarily, a commercial opportunity for us.

Our products serve both medical and recreational growers, dispensers, and customers. Our product development and introduction are focused in Colorado, where both medical and recreational cannabis are permitted under a developing regulatory regime, as well as California, a rapidly evolving market that we believe presents an opportunity for our products. We are preparing for future expansion if and as cannabis for medical or recreational use becomes legalized and regulated in additional states that have ongoing public dialogue and regulatory or legislative consideration regarding legalization, such as Nevada, Oregon, the District of Columbia, and others. In the next 12 months, we are considering operating in only Colorado, Washington, California (medical only), and Oregon, since the Oregon voters approved legalization, with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission tasked with regulating sales of marijuana.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015,

Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014

Revenue and Costs of Goods Sold

Revenue was $499 and $48,156 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $47,657 during the most recent interim period, when our operations were curtailed due to extreme shortages of cash. Our revenue has been generated through a combination of software development and consulting services related to custom-built software. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we generated the majority of our revenue from custom software development related to CannaLIMs, ongoing recurring contracts for BumpUp Rewards, and custom development related to BumpUp Rewards white-label applications.

Our cost of goods sold was $0 and $6,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $6,800 during the most recent interim period, when our operations were curtailed due to extreme shortages of cash.

Operating Expenses

Stock-based compensation expense was $119,125 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense in the current year is largely due to warrants issued to officers, consultants, and other service providers. There were no warrants issued in the prior period.

Professional fees were $95,286 and $58,847 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $36,439, or 61.9%, in the current period. The increase can be largely attributed to increased legal fees associated with our SEC filings.

Salary and wage expense was $49,092 and $335,297 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $286,205 or 85.3%, in the current period. The decrease in the current period is due to a decrease in the number of employees. In addition, in the prior period there was $130,000 of noncash stock compensation expense for shares issued to our chief executive officer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

General and administrative expense was $68,240 and $96,394 for the three months September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $28,154, or 29.2%, in the current period. The decrease in the current period can be attributed to a decrease in consulting expense and the use of other subcontractors.

Other Income and Expense

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had total other expense of $1,335,360, compared to $1,410 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $12,749, amortization of debt discount of $86,291, a loss on the issuance of convertible debt of $418,079, a loss on the write down of assets of $258,766, impairment loss on investment of $599,475, and a $40,000 gain on the forgiveness of debt. In the prior period, we recorded only $1,410 of interest expense.

Net Loss

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $1,666,604, as compared to a net loss of $450,592 in the prior period. This increase is the direct result of stock-based compensation, interest expense for debt discount, and the loss on issuance of convertible debt, as discussed above.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015,

Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014

Revenue and Costs of Goods Sold

Revenue was $59,150 and $76,404 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $17,254, or 22.4%, during the most recent interim period, when our operations were curtailed due to extreme shortages of cash. Our revenue has been generated through a combination of software development and consulting services related to custom-built software. We generate the majority of our revenue from custom software development related to CannaLIMs, ongoing recurring contracts for BumpUp Rewards, and custom development related to BumpUp Rewards white-label applications.

Our cost of goods sold was $24,260 and $10,018 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $14,242, or 142%, in the current period. The increase in cost of goods sold is a result of additional expense for software development.

Operating Expenses

Stock-based compensation expense was $604,592 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense in the current year is largely due to warrants issued to officers, consultants, and other service providers. There were no warrants issued in the prior period.

Professional fees were $307,713 and $155,827 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $151,886, or 97.4%, in the current period. The increase can be largely attributed to increased legal fees associated with our SEC filings.

Salary and wage expense was $183,793 and $572,151 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $388,358, or 67.8%, in the current period. The decrease in the current period is due to a decrease in the number of employees. In addition, in the prior period there was $130,000 of noncash stock compensation expense for shares issued to our chief executive officer.

General and administrative expense was $198,261 and $200,585 for the nine months September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $2,324, or 1.1%, in the current period.

Other Income and Expense

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had total other expense of $2,256,675, compared to $2,088 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $29,204, amortization of debt discount of $502,140, a loss on the issuance of convertible debt of $907,090, a loss on the write down of assets of $258,766, impairment loss on investment of $599,475, and a $40,000 gain on the forgiveness of debt. In the prior period, we recorded only $2,088 of interest expense.

Net Loss

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $3,516,144, as compared to a net loss of $864,265 in the prior period. This increase is the direct result of stock-based compensation, interest expense for debt discount, and the loss on issuance of convertible debt, as discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash of $307,860 in operating activities and received $302,000 from financing activities.

Our current business expenses average approximately $30,000 per month, excluding capital expenditures specific to new product launches. We continue to focus on reducing our monthly business expenses through cost reductions and operational streamlining. Currently, we do not have enough cash on hand to sustain our business operations and, alongside expected revenue, we expect to access external capital resources in the near future. At the moment, we are seeing increased adoption across our business lines, but we cannot guarantee this will continue.

We anticipate also accessing the capital markets in order to fund future research and development, as well as expand product offerings to include future versions of products and possible acquisitions of ancillary products and services. We have budgeted $1 million for capital expenditures and other costs during the next 12 months, consisting of $200,000 for enhanced software development and marketing in the coming six months, $200,000 in overhead, $500,000 for debt retirement, and $100,000 for legal, audit and accounting expenses. We have budgeted $500,000 for debt retirement and, if necessary, to provide for refinancing or extensions of our existing debt, including principal and any interest due under the terms of our current financing agreements with our capital partners. We do plan to raise additional debt financing, although we cannot guarantee what structures our sources of financing may choose in the future, and there is no guarantee we will be able to secure additional funding. In addition, the vast majority of our debt is convertible into common stock, in which case we will not have to retire it; the investors are able to convert the debt into our shares. If we were to retire all of our outstanding debt, including the convertible promissory notes, and pay the maximum potential interest due, we would need to budget approximately $700,000.

Our efforts are focused on increasing revenue while we explore external funding alternatives as our current cash is insufficient to fund operations for the next 12 months. Although our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we feel that our revenue potential is sufficient for our business to continue as a going concern. However, in order to expand our product offerings, we expect that we will require additional investments and revenue.

21 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

As we continue to develop new products and identify specific commercialization opportunities, we will focus on those product markets and opportunities for which we might be able to get external funding through joint venture agreements, strategic partnerships, or other direct investments.

Going Concern

Our interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the interim unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we not be unable to continue as a going concern.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in their application. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes to our December 31, 2015, financial statements. Note that our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We cannot assure that actual results will not differ from those estimates.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees . ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract.

We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of ASC 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Revenue Recognition

We follow ASC 605-10-S99-1,  Revenue Recognition , for revenue recognition. We will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

Income Taxes

We follow ASC 740-10-30 , Income Taxes-Initial Measurement , which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date.

We adopted ASC 740-10-25,  Income Taxes Recognition . ASC 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-25, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. We had no material adjustments to our liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of ASC 740-10-25.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer (whom we refer to in this periodic report as our Certifying Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Certifying Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and September as of September 30, 2016, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
