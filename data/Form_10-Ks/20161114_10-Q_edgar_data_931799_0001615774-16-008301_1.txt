Statements (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1     Organization
and Nature of Business  

GlyEco, Inc. (the  Company ,
 we , or  our ) is a chemical recycling and distribution company, which specializes in collecting and
recycling waste glycol streams into reusable glycol products that are sold to third party customers in the automotive and
industrial end-markets in the United States. Our proprietary technology allows us to recycle all five major types of waste
glycol into high-quality products usable in any glycol application. We currently operate six processing centers in the United
States, with our corporate offices located in Rock Hill, South Carolina. These processing centers are located in (1)
Minneapolis, Minnesota, (2) Indianapolis, Indiana, (3) Lakeland, Florida, (4) Rock Hill, South Carolina, (5) Tea, South
Dakota, and (6) Landover, Maryland. The Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lakeland, Florida, Rock Hill, South Carolina and Tea, South
Dakota facilities have distillation equipment and operations for recycling waste glycol streams as well as blending equipment
and operations for mixing glycol and other chemicals to produce finished products for sale to third party customers, while
the Indianapolis, Indiana and Landover, Maryland facilities currently only have blending equipment and operations for mixing
glycol and other chemicals to produce finished products for sale to third party customers.  We also previously operated
a processing center in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 

The Company was formed in the State of Nevada
on October 21, 2011. We were formed to acquire the assets of companies in the business of recycling and processing waste glycol
and to apply our proprietary technology to provide a higher quality of glycol to end-market users throughout North America. 

We are currently comprised of the parent corporation
GlyEco, Inc., and the acquisition subsidiaries that were formed to acquire the processing centers listed above, including
the Elizabeth, New Jersey Processing Center which we no longer operate. These processing centers are held in seven subsidiaries
under the names of GlyEco Acquisition Corp. #1 through GlyEco Acquisition Corp. #7. 

Going Concern   

The condensed consolidated financial statements
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has yet to achieve profitable
operations and is dependent on its ability to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Ultimately, we plan to achieve profitable
operations through the implementation of operating efficiencies at our facilities and increased revenue through the offering of
additional products and the expansion of our geographic footprint through acquisitions, broader distribution from our current facilities
and/or the opening of additional facilities. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

NOTE 2   Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ( GAAP ), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normally recurring accruals)
necessary for a fair presentation on an interim basis. The operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted; however, management
believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. This report should be read in conjunction
with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the Company s
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

Principles of
Consolidation   

These condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of GlyEco, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounting transactions
have been eliminated as a result of consolidation. The subsidiaries include: GlyEco Acquisition Corp #1 ( Acquisition Sub
#1 ) located in Minneapolis, Minnesota; GlyEco Acquisition Corp #2 ( Acquisition Sub #2 ) located in Indianapolis,
Indiana; GlyEco Acquisition Corp #3 ( Acquisition Sub #3 ) located in Lakeland, Florida; GlyEco Acquisition Corp #4
( Acquisition Sub #4 ) formerly located in Elizabeth, New Jersey; GlyEco Acquisition Corp #5 ( Acquisition Sub
#5 ) located in Rock Hill, South Carolina; GlyEco Acquisition Corp #6 ( Acquisition Sub #6 ) located in Tea,
South Dakota; and GlyEco Acquisition Corp. #7 ( Acquisition Sub #7 ) located in Landover, Maryland. 

Operating Segments   

Operating segments are defined as components
of an enterprise for each of which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by our chief
operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing
the performance of each segment. Operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment if the segments have similar
economic characteristics, among other criteria. The Company operates as one segment. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Because of the use of estimates inherent within the financial reporting process, actual results may
differ significantly from those estimates.  Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, items such as, the
allowance for doubtful accounts, the valuation of share-based compensation and warrants, the allocation of the purchase price in
the Company s acquisitions, the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangibles and their
estimated useful lives, contingent liabilities, and environmental and asset retirement obligations. Due to the uncertainties inherent
in the formulation of accounting estimates, it is reasonable to expect that these estimates could be materially revised within
the next year. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue when (1) delivery
of product has occurred or services have been rendered, (2) there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, (3) selling prices
are fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability from the customer (individual customers and distributors) is reasonably assured.
Revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from the sale of the Company s products. This generally occurs when the Company s
products are shipped from its facility as title has passed. Revenue is recorded net of estimated cash discounts. The Company estimates
and accrues an allowance for sales returns at the time the product is sold. To date, sales returns have not been material. Shipping
costs passed to the customer are included in net sales. 

Costs and Expenses   

Cost of goods sold includes all direct material
and labor costs and those indirect costs of bringing raw materials to sale condition, including depreciation of equipment used
in manufacturing and shipping and handling costs. Selling, general, and administrative costs are charged to operating expenses
as incurred. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses. Such amounts
were insignificant during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 

Accounts Receivable   

Accounts receivable are recognized and carried
at the original invoice amount less an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance
for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer s willingness or ability
to pay, the Company s compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the
ongoing relationship with the customer. Accounts with outstanding balances longer than the payment terms are considered past due.
We do not charge interest on past due balances. The Company writes off trade receivables when all reasonable collection efforts
have been exhausted. Bad debt expense is reflected as a component of general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $66,147 and $203,270 as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. 

Inventories   

Inventories are reported at the lower of cost
or market. The cost of raw materials, including feedstocks and additives, is determined on an average unit cost of the units in
a production lot. Work-in-process represents labor, material and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing costs at an
average unit cost of the units in the production lot. Finished goods represents work-in-process items with additive costs added.
The Company periodically reviews its inventories for obsolete or unsalable items and adjusts its carrying value to reflect estimated
realizable values. 

Property, Plant and Equipment   

Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. The Company provides for depreciation on the cost of its equipment using the straight-line method over an estimated useful
life, ranging from three to twenty years, and zero salvage value. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. 

For purposes of computing depreciation, the
useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows: 

Leasehold improvements   
       
      Lesser of the remaining lease term or 5 years    

Machinery and equipment   
       
       3-20 years    

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company has adopted the framework for measuring
fair value that establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). 

The three levels of inputs that may be used
to measure fair value are as follows: 

Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date;   

Level 2 : Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and   

Level 3 : Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Valuation is generated from model-based techniques with the unobservable assumptions reflecting our own estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   

Cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, amounts due to related parties, contingent acquisition obligations and current portion of
capital lease obligations and notes payable are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair
values primarily due to their short-term nature. As to long-term capital lease obligations and notes payable, estimated fair values
are based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities. 

Net Loss Per Share Calculation   

The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during a period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing the
net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive
securities. The Company s potentially dilutive securities outstanding are not shown in a diluted net loss per share calculation
because their effect in both 2016 and 2015 would be anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2016, these potentially dilutive securities
included warrants of 8,266,137 and stock options of 7,935,093 for a total of 16,201,230. At September 30, 2015, these potentially
dilutive securities included warrants of 16,567,326 and stock options of 11,724,585 for a total of 28,291,911. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for its income taxes
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
740,  Income Taxes,  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment
date. An allowance for the deferred tax asset is established if it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. 

Share-based Compensation   

All share-based payments to employees and non-employee
directors, including grants of employee stock options, are expensed based on their estimated fair values at the grant date, in
accordance with ASC 718. Compensation expense for share-based payments to employees and directors is recorded over the vesting
period using the estimated fair value on the date of grant, as calculated by the Company using the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM )
option-pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation. For awards with only service conditions that have graded vesting schedules,
compensation cost is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, unless vesting occurs
earlier. For awards with market conditions, compensation cost is recorded on the accelerated attribution method over the derived
service period. 

Non-employee share-based compensation is accounted
for based on the fair value of the related stock or options, using the BSM, or the fair value of the goods or services on the measurement
date, whichever is more readily determinable. 

Reclassifications   

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current period presentation. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

There have been no recent accounting pronouncements
or changes in accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to the Company, except as discussed
below. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). This updated
guidance supersedes the current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The updated guidance introduces
a five-step model to achieve its core principal of the entity recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption
is not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until December 15, 2017. The FASB also
agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. The Company has not yet selected a
transition method and is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial
statements and disclosures. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that
a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  ( ASU 2014-12 ). ASU 2014-12 provides
explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance
condition that affects vesting, or as a non-vesting condition that affects the grant-date fair value of an award. The update requires
that compensation costs are recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved
and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized
compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. This update is effective for
the annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.
There was no impact from the adoption of this ASU. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 defines management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and provides
related footnote disclosure requirements. Under GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting
organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption
is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting establishes the fundamental
basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. The update provides guidance on when there is substantial doubt about
an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and how the underlying conditions and events should be disclosed
in the footnotes. It is intended to reduce diversity that existed in footnote disclosures because of the lack of guidance about
when substantial doubt existed. The amendments in this update are effective for the year ended December 31, 2016. Early application
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on the condensed consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Inventory  (Topic 330) ( ASU 2015-11 ). The amendments in ASU 2015-11 require that an entity measure inventory
within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transaction. The amendments in this update more
closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting. ASU
2015-11 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this update should
be applied prospectively with early application permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period. The Company
is currently assessing this guidance for future implementation. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
 Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , an update to accounting guidance to simplify the presentation
of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires an entity to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any valuation
allowance, as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within these reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and
disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases , which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new
arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. While the Company is still evaluating ASU 2016-02, the Company expects the
adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition due to the recognition
of the lease rights and obligations as assets and liabilities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of
ASU 2016-02 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures .   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which
simplified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting the new stock compensation standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

the Company had a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward available to reduce future taxable income, if any. The NOL carryforward
begins to expire in 2027, and fully expires in 2035. Because management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not
that the Company will be able to realize the tax benefit related to the NOL carryforward, by having taxable income, a valuation
allowance has been established as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to reduce the net tax benefit asset value to
zero. The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consists of state tax expenses. 

NOTE 5   Property, Plant and Equipment   

The Company s property, plant and equipment
were as follows: 

NOTE 6  Stockholders' Equity

The Company s articles of incorporation
authorize the Company to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value, preferred shares having preferences to be determined
by the board of directors for dividends, and liquidation of the Company s assets. Of the 40,000,000 preferred shares the
Company is authorized by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors has designated 3,000,000 as Series AA preferred
shares. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no
shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. 

Common Stock   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has 119,575,964, $0.0001 par value, shares of common stock (the  Common
Stock ) outstanding. The Company's articles of incorporation authorize the Company to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of the
Common Stock. The holders are entitled to one vote for each share on matters submitted to a vote to shareholders, and to share
pro rata in all dividends payable on common stock after payment of dividends on any preferred shares having preference in payment
of dividends. 

Equity Incentive Program  

On December 18, 2014, the Company s Board
of Directors approved an Equity Incentive Program (the  Equity Incentive Program ), whereby the Company s employees
may elect to receive equity in lieu of cash for all or part of their salary compensation. 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, employees could elect to receive eight and a third shares of common
stock per each dollar participated in the Equity Incentive Program. Nine employees participated in the Equity Incentive Plan during
the quarter. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued the following shares of common stock in connection with financing activities:  

On February 26, 2016, the Company closed a
rights offering. The rights offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and declared effective on January 20, 2016. 

Pursuant to the rights offering, the Company distributed to holders of its Common Stock non-transferable subscription
rights to purchase up to 50,200,947 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Each shareholder received
one subscription right for every one share of common stock owned at 5:00 p.m. EST on October 30, 2015, the record date. Each subscription
right entitled a shareholder to purchase 0.7 shares of the Company s common stock at a subscription price of $0.08 per share,
which was referred to as the basic subscription privilege. If a shareholder fully exercised their basic subscription privilege
and other shareholders did not fully exercise their basic subscription privileges, shareholders could also exercise an over-subscription
privilege to purchase a portion of the unsubscribed shares at the same subscription price of $0.08 per share. 

During the rights offering, subscription rights
to purchase a total of 37,475,620 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, were exercised. The exercise of these subscription
rights resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $2,998,050 before deducting expenses of the rights offering.

Summary: 

Performance and/or market based stock awards  

In January 2015, the Board of Directors approved
the issuance of 940,595 restricted shares of the Company. These shares will be issued to the then members of the Board of Directors
upon vesting, which will be when the market price of the Company s common stock trades at or above $2 for a specified period. 

The initial value of the restricted stock
grant was approximately $257,000, which will be amortized over the estimated service period. The Company recorded an expense
of $7,125 and $50,565 from the amortization of the unvested restricted shares for the quarter and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively. The shares were valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation with a six-year life, 88.0% volatility and a
risk free interest rate of 1.79%. 

In September 2015, the Board of Directors approved
the issuance of 1,524,245 restricted shares of the Company. These shares will be issued to the then Interim Chief Executive Officer
and President upon vesting, which will be according to the following terms: 

50% if the Company has positive EBITDA (a non GAAP measure) for the first half of 2016.   

The initial value of the restricted stock grant
was approximately $92,000. The Company has not recorded any expense related to this grant as the applicable accounting guidance
requires that  if the performance condition must be met for the award to vest, compensation
cost will be recognized only if the performance condition is satisfied and the above noted performance conditions have not been
met. Further, the estimated quantity of awards for which it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved must be
reevaluated each reporting period and adjusted and management has estimated that the probability of achieving the performance conditions
is minimal.  

The above
noted vesting criteria were not met during the measurement period. As such, the grant expired without the vesting of any shares.

NOTE 7   Business
Combination   

Effective June 26,
2016, Acquisition Sub #3 entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Brian s On-Site Recycling, Inc., a Florida corporation
( BOSR ), and Brian Fidalgo, principal of BOSR (the  BOSR Principal ) and General Manager of our Florida
processing center, pursuant to which Acquisition Sub #3 acquired certain assets of BOSR, primarily equipment and customer relationships
for aggregate consideration of $200,000, of which $100,000 is subject to an earn out provision. The period of the earn out is expected
to be over one year. Per the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company placed $100,000 in an escrow account related to
the earn out and has been reflected as restricted cash in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. This acquisition
expanded the Company s customer base in Florida. 

We accounted for the
acquisition of BOSR as required under applicable accounting guidance. Tangible assets acquired are recorded at fair value. Identifiable
intangible assets that we acquired are recognized separately if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are
separable, and are recorded at fair value. Goodwill is recorded as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value
of the net identifiable assets acquired. 

The allocation of the purchase price is
as follows: 

The Company is amortizing the intangibles (excluding
goodwill) over an estimated useful life of five years. The acquisition was not considered to be significant. The Company has included
the financial results of the BOSR acquisition in its consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date and the results
from BOSR were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 9   Related Party Transactions  

Former Interim Chief Executive Officer   

The former Interim Chief Executive Officer,
who stepped down at the end of April 2016, is the sole owner of Rocco Advisors. Amounts due and payable to the former Interim Chief
Executive Officer for services performed were paid to Rocco Advisors, instead of directly to the former Interim Chief Executive
Officer. These services and fees were in the ordinary course of business and subject to an agreement approved by the Company s
Board of Directors. 

Vice President of U.S. Operations   

The Vice President of US Operations is the sole owner of BKB Holdings, LLC, which is the landlord of the property
where GlyEco Acquisition Corp #5 s processing center is located. The Vice President of U.S. Operations also is the sole owner
of Renew Resources, LLC, which provides services to the Company as a vendor. 

Florida General Manager   

The General Manager of our Florida processing
center, who joined the Company in December 2015, also managed the business of BOSR, which was a competitor to the Company in the
local Florida market until the Company purchased BOSR on June 26, 2016 (see Note 7). The Company sold finished goods to BOSR and
bought raw materials from BOSR. BOSR is no longer considered a related party after the purchase date. 

Former Chief Technical Officer

the Company in late 2015, is the sole owner of WEBA Technologies ( WEBA ), which was paid for products sold to GlyEco,
primarily consisting of additive packages for antifreeze. The Company also incurred expenses for consulting services provided
by the former Chief Technical Officer in the ordinary course of business. The WEBA transactions are summarized below. 

NOTE 10   Commitments and Contingencies  

Litigation   

The Company may be party to legal proceedings
in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that the nature of these proceedings (collection actions, etc.)
are typical for a Company of our size and scope of operations. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse
result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Below is an overview of two pending legal
proceedings and one outstanding alleged claim. 

On January 8, 2016, Acquisition Sub. #4 filed
a civil action against Onyxx Group LLC in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida. This civil action relates to an outstanding
balance due from Onyxx Group LLC to Acquisition Sub. #4. In September 2016, the Company received a favorable judgment regarding
this civil action in the amount of $95,000. 

On March 22, 2016, Acquisition Sub. #4 filed
a civil action against Encore Petroleum, LLC in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division, Hudson County. This civil action
relates to an outstanding balance due from Encore Petroleum to Acquisition Sub. #4. This civil action is still pending. 

The Company is also aware of one matter that
involves an alleged claim against the Company, and it is at least reasonably possible that the claim will be pursued. The claim
involves contracts with our former director and his related entities that provided services and was our landlord for the Company s
former processing facility in New Jersey. In this matter, the landlord of the Company s formerly leased property claims back
rent is due for property used by the Company outside of the scope of its lease agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015,
the former landlord denied the Company access to the New Jersey facility and prepared an eviction notice. The Company negotiated
a payment in the amount of $250,000 to regain access to the facility, and reached an accord to negotiate with the landlord to resolve
the outstanding issues by May 31, 2015. On December 28, 2015, the Company ultimately approved the termination of the lease agreements
related to the New Jersey facility, thereby ceasing all operations at that particular facility. This termination was prompted by
the former landlord s demand for payment of approximately $2.3 million to maintain access to the facility. In September 2016,
the Company reached an agreement with the landlord. The agreement required the Company to resolve certain environmental issues
regarding the former processing facility and make certain payments to the landlord. The Company, the landlord and their related
entities also agreed to a full and final settlement of existing and possible futures claims between the parties. As of November 14, 2016, the Company believes it has addressed the environmental issues by removing and disposing
of the waste from the facility and cleaning the storage tanks. Additionally, as of November 14, 2016, the Company has paid $295,000
of the agreed upon $335,000 payment to the landlord. The remaining $40,000 will be paid to the landlord upon resolution of related
pending regulatory matters, subject to certain additional terms. Because the Company had already fully reserved for this contingency,
the agreement s execution did not result in an additional expense to the Company in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Environmental Matters   

We are subject to federal, state, and local
laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and
water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and occupational health and safety. It is management s
opinion that the Company is not currently exposed to significant environmental remediation liabilities or asset retirement obligations.
However, if a release of hazardous substances occurs, or is found on one of our properties from prior activity, we may be subject
to liability arising out of such conditions and the amount of such liability could be material. 

The Company accrues for potential environmental
liabilities in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; that is, when it is probable
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. The Company reviews the status of its environmental
sites on a yearly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly. Such potential liabilities accrued by the Company do not take into
consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds. The Company maintains insurance coverage for unintentional acts
that result in environmental remediation liabilities up to $1 million per occurrence; $2 million in the aggregate, with an umbrella
liability policy that doubles the coverage. These policies do, however, take into account the likely share other parties will bear
at remediation sites. It would be difficult to estimate the Company s ultimate level of liability due to the number of other
parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the uncertainty as to the
nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment,
the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, and the
often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur. Nevertheless, the Company does not currently believe that
any claims, penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The Company is aware of one environmental remediation
issue related to our former leased property in New Jersey, which is currently subject to a remediation stemming from the sale of
property by the previous owner in 2008 to the current landlord. To management s knowledge, the former landlord has engaged
a licensed site remediation professional and had assumed responsibility for this remediation. In management s opinion the
liability for this remediation is the responsibility of the former landlord. However, the former landlord has disputed this
position and it is an open issue subject to negotiation. Currently, we have no knowledge as to the scope of the landlord s
former remediation obligation.

included elsewhere herein. 

Company Overview  

Our principal business activity is the processing
of waste glycol into high-quality recycled glycol products, specifically automotive antifreeze, and related specialty blended antifreeze,
which we sell in the automotive and industrial end-markets. We operate six processing centers located in the eastern region of
the United States. 

These processing centers are located in (1) Minneapolis, Minnesota, (2) Indianapolis, Indiana, (3) Lakeland,
Florida, (4) Rock Hill, South Carolina, (5) Tea, South Dakota, and (6) Landover, Maryland. Our processing centers utilize a fleet
of trucks to collect waste material for processing and delivering recycled glycol products directly to retail end users at their
storefronts, which is typically 50-100 gallons per customer order. Collectively, we directly service approximately 5,000 generators
of waste glycol. To meet the delivery volume needs of our existing customers, we supplement our collected and processed glycol
with new or virgin glycol that we purchase in bulk from various suppliers. In addition to our retail end users, we also sell our
recycled glycol products to wholesale or bulk distributors who, in turn, sell to retail end users specifically as automotive or
specialty blended antifreeze. In certain markets we recently began selling windshield washer fluids which we do not recycle. The
Company delivers this additional product to same store and new store customers as a non-recycled product. 

We have deployed our proprietary technology
across our footprint, allowing for safe and efficient handling of waste streams, application of our processing technology and Quality
Control   Assurance Program ( QC A ), sales of high-quality glycol products, and data systems allowing for
tracking, training, and further development of our products and service. We have rolled out GlyEco University, a data and training
tool for GlyEco stakeholders. GlyEco University will continue to be our center for intellectual property, advanced development
group, and both internal and external glycol and GlyEco course training. We have expanded our space in Rock Hill, SC, for our QC A,
research and advanced development group headquarters, as well as for our sales and client services groups, respectively. 

We ceased operations at our former New Jersey
Processing Center, effective December 28, 2015. We believe the reduction in expenses and related negative cash flow from the New
Jersey Processing Center will allow the Company to continue and advance its retail automotive business, and as a result, help support
the goal of positive cash flows from the Company s six processing centers. With the expected reduction in cash losses, we
plan to reinvest in expanding our footprint in the United States. 

Our knowledge and focus on the glycol industry creates opportunities for GlyEco to leverage our process technology.
These include difficult to process waste streams, process engineering partnerships, technology licensing, and other types of ventures.
Also, our current footprint and markets remain open to growth and same store increases. We will weigh our opportunities as they
are introduced, leveraging our management team and Board of Directors as needed to support or contribute experience to these opportunities.
We will invest in infrastructure to support the growth of our existing business, and as we continue to add customers, we will be
required to multiply the capacity of our processing centers. We will increase our processing center capacities through optimizing
our existing systems and through the purchase of distillation equipment, tanks to store newly acquired feedstock waste streams,
delivery vehicles for distribution locations, satellite distribution center storage, and, as needed, certain recycling hardware.
As our business is focused on retail we will continue to evolve our sales and marketing groups primarily in marketing automation,
lead generation, and sales onboarding. We will also continue to add human resources in situations where they may be optimized for
effectiveness, of which we have identified several. We believe our continuing adaptation to the market place will support greater
acceptance of glycol recycling, sales opportunities, and greater price integrity of our products. GlyEco is a brand and as such
we will continue to promote the values and culture of the organization. Our marketing messages will be delivered through social,
print, and other related media distribution. 

We are dedicated to being the standard in the
glycol industry by providing the highest-quality products, services, and technology possible to our customers. 

Strategic Plan  

Expand Customer Count and Profits   .
 We intend to utilize our ability to produce an exceptional product, accept difficult streams, provide outstanding customer
service, and advance outbound sales to drive market expansion. Our customers and partners require high levels of quality and sensitivity
to regulatory and environmental compliance, which we emphasize through initial and through ongoing field training, facility policies
and procedures, and  through  ongoing analysis of operating performance. Our current
markets offer opportunity for improvement and we believe we can increase same store sales year over year. Also, we plan to enter
new markets with strategic partners and current customers. In some markets we intend to sell, other accretive products such as
windshield washer fluid.  

Expand Feedstock Supply Volume.  We intend
to expand our feedstock supply volume by growing our relationships with direct waste generators and indirect waste collectors.
We plan to increase the volume we collect from direct waste generators in the following ways: stressing segregation from other
liquid wastes and focusing on waste glycol recovery to our existing customers; attracting new waste generator customers by displacing
incumbent waste collectors through product quality and customer service value propositions; and attracting new waste generators
in territories that we do not currently serve. We plan to increase the volume we collect from indirect waste collectors by implementing
specific sales programs and increasing personnel dedicated to sales generation. 

New Market Development . We will focus
primarily on increasing our current footprint and strategic locations that can contribute to the profitability of our business.
In addition, our new market development may include larger retailers or limited partnerships for our intellectual property. We
are a technology company in the glycol waste and antifreeze product business and as such we may address each new market differently
  leveraging our resources and assets accordingly. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We have identified in the consolidated financial
statements contained herein certain critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. Management reviews with the audit committee the selection, application and disclosure of
critical accounting policies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant
level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These areas include going concern status collectability
of accounts receivable, inventory, impairment of goodwill, carrying amounts and useful lives of intangible assets, fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. We base
our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas, and information or valuations and various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from amounts previously estimated. 

We believe that of our significant accounting
policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity: 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue when (1) delivery
of product has occurred or services have been rendered, (2) there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, (3) selling prices
are fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability from the customer (individual customers and distributors) is reasonably assured.
Revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from the sale of the Company s products. This generally occurs when the Company s
products are shipped from its facility as title has passed. Revenue is recorded net of estimated cash discounts. The Company estimates
and accrues an allowance for sales returns at the time the product is sold. To date, sales returns have not been material. Shipping
costs passed to the customer are included in the net sales. 

Collectability of Accounts Receivable   

Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts
due from customers from sales of products and is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. In order to record our accounts
receivable at their net realizable value, we assess their collectability. A considerable amount of judgment is required in order
to make this assessment, based on a detailed analysis of the aging of our receivables, the credit worthiness of our customers and
our historical bad debts and other adjustments. If economic, industry or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier
estimates, we increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts by recording additional expense in the period in which we become
aware of the new conditions. 

All our customers are based in the United
States. The economic conditions in the United States can significantly impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable. 

Inventories   

Inventories consist primarily of used glycol to be recycled, recycled glycol for resale and supplies used
in the recycling process. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost recorded on an average cost basis. Costs
include purchase costs, fleet and fuel costs, direct labor, transportation costs and production related costs. In determining whether
inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing
on-hand quantities, historical sales and production usage. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences
or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventory. These factors could
make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. 

Long-Lived Assets   

We periodically evaluate whether events and
circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of property and equipment and intangible assets
or whether the remaining balance of the long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Instances that may lead
to an impairment include the following: (i) a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset group; (ii) a significant
adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; (iii)
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset or asset
group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (iv) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset or asset group; (v) a current-period operating or
cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing
losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or (vi) a current expectation that, more likely than not,
a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated
useful life. 

Upon recognition of an event, as previously
described, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest, over the remaining life of the property
and equipment and long-lived assets in assessing their recoverability. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset(s) exceeds the fair value of the asset(s). We primarily employ the two following methodologies for determining
the fair value of a long-lived asset: (i) the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between
willing parties; or (ii) the present value of expected future cash flows grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable
independent cash flows. 

Goodwill   

As of September 30, 2016, goodwill and net
intangible assets recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet aggregated to $1,129,206 (of which $885,295 is goodwill
that is not subject to amortization).  We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year. In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we perform goodwill impairment testing at least annually, unless indicators of impairment
exist in interim periods. Our test of goodwill impairment includes assessing qualitative factors and the use of judgment in evaluating
economic conditions: industry and market conditions, cost factors, and entity-specific events, as well as overall financial performance.
The impairment test for goodwill uses a two-step approach. Step one compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with
goodwill to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, step two must be performed. Step two compares
the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including
any unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting
unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the
excess. 

In addition to the required goodwill impairment
analysis, we also review the recoverability and estimated useful life of our net intangibles with finite lives when an indicator
of impairment exists. When we acquire intangible assets, management determines the estimated useful life, expected residual value
if any and appropriate allocation method of the asset value based on the information available at the time. Reaching a determination
on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition,
other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in
an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our assumptions with respect to expected future cash flows
relating to intangible assets is impacted by our assessment of (i) the proprietary nature of our recycling process combined with
(ii) the technological advances we have made allowing us to recycle all five major types of waste glycol into a virgin-quality
product usable in any glycol application along with (iii) the fact that the market is currently served by primarily smaller local
processors. If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure or other events
and circumstances change, we may be required to record impairment charges of goodwill and intangible assets in future periods and
we may need to change our estimated useful life of amortizing intangible assets. Any impairment charges that we may take in the
future or any change to amortization expense could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. 

Share-based Compensation   

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model to estimate the value of options and warrants issued to employees and consultants as compensation for services rendered to
the Company. This model uses estimates of volatility, risk free interest rate and the expected term of the options or warrants,
along with the current market price of the underlying stock, to estimate the value of the options and warrants on the date of grant.
In addition, the calculation of compensation costs requires that the Company estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited
during the vesting period. The fair value of the stock-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the awards. For stock-based
awards that vest based on performance conditions, expense is recognized when it is probable that the conditions will be met. For
stock-based awards that vest based on market conditions, expense is recognized on the accelerated attribution method over the derived
service period. 

Assumptions used in the calculation were determined
as follows: 

Expected term is generally determined using the weighted average of the contractual term and vesting period of the award;   

Expected volatility of award grants made under the Company s plans is measured using the historical daily changes in the market price of the Company, over the expected term of the award;   

Risk-free interest rate is equivalent to the implied yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds with a remaining maturity equal to the expected term of the awards; and,   

Forfeitures are based on the history of cancellations of awards granted by the Company and management s analysis of potential forfeitures.   

Accounting for Income Taxes   

We use the asset and liability method to account
for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities,
and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are
required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual
current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred
revenue, depreciation on property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and losses for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets, which include tax loss carry-forwards, and liabilities, which are included within
our consolidated balance sheets. We then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income,
and to the extent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient operating history, a valuation allowance is established.
To the extent a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period, we include an adjustment within the tax provision
of our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had established a full valuation allowance
for all deferred tax assets. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
we did not recognize any assets or liabilities relative to uncertain tax positions, nor do we anticipate any significant unrecognized
tax benefits will be recorded during the next 12 months. Any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized
in income tax expense. Since there are no unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken, there are no accrued penalties
or interest. 

Contingencies   

Litigation  

The Company may be party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes
that the nature of these proceedings (collection actions, etc.) are typical for a Company of our size and scope of operations.
Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that
may harm our business. Below is an overview of two pending legal proceedings and one outstanding alleged claim. 

On January 8, 2016, Acquisition Sub. #4 filed
a civil action against Onyxx Group LLC in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida. This civil action relates to an outstanding
balance due from Onyxx Group LLC to Acquisition Sub. #4. In September 2016, the Company received a favorable judgment regarding
this civil action in the amount of $95,000. 

On March 22, 2016, Acquisition Sub. #4 filed
a civil action against Encore Petroleum, LLC in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division, Hudson County. This civil action
relates to an outstanding balance due from Encore Petroleum to Acquisition Sub. #4. This civil action is still pending. 

The Company is also aware of one matter that involves an alleged claim against the Company, and it is at least
reasonably possible that the claim will be pursued. The claim involves contracts with our former director and his related entities
that provided services and was our landlord for the Company s former processing facility in New Jersey. In this matter, the
landlord of the Company s formerly leased property claims back rent is due for property used by the Company outside of the
scope of its lease agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the former landlord denied the Company access to the New
Jersey facility and prepared an eviction notice. The Company negotiated a payment in the amount of $250,000 to regain access to
the facility, and reached an accord to negotiate with the landlord to resolve the outstanding issues by May 31, 2015. On December
28, 2015, the Company ultimately approved the termination of the lease agreements related to the New Jersey facility, thereby ceasing
all operations at that particular facility. This termination was prompted by the former landlord s demand for payment of
approximately $2.3 million to maintain access to the facility. In September 2016, the Company reached an agreement with the landlord.
The agreement required the Company to resolve certain environmental issues regarding the former processing facility and make certain
payments to the landlord. The Company, the landlord and their related entities also agreed to a full and final settlement of existing
and possible futures claims between the parties. As of November 14, 2016, the Company believes it has addressed the environmental
issues by removing and disposing of the waste from the facility and cleaning the storage tanks. Additionally, as of November 14,
2016, the Company has paid $295,000 of the agreed upon $335,000 payment to the landlord. The remaining $40,000 will be paid to
the landlord upon resolution of related pending regulatory matters, subject to certain additional terms. Because the Company had
already fully reserved for this contingency, the agreement s execution did not result in an additional expense to the Company
in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Environmental Matters   

We are subject to federal, state, and local
laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and
water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and occupational health and safety. It is management s
opinion that the Company is not currently exposed to significant environmental remediation liabilities or asset retirement obligations.
However, if a release of hazardous substances occurs, or is found on one of our properties from prior activity, we may be subject
to liability arising out of such conditions and the amount of such liability could be material. 

The Company accrues for potential environmental
liabilities in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; that is, when it is probable
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. The Company reviews the status of its environmental
sites on a yearly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly. Such potential liabilities accrued by the Company do not take into
consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds. The Company maintains insurance coverage for unintentional acts
that result in environmental remediation liabilities up to $1 million per occurrence; $2 million in the aggregate, with an umbrella
liability policy that doubles the coverage. These policies do, however, take into account the likely share other parties will bear
at remediation sites. It would be difficult to estimate the Company s ultimate level of liability due to the number of other
parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the uncertainty as to the
nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment,
the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, and the
often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur. Nevertheless, the Company does not currently believe that
any claims, penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The Company is aware of one environmental remediation
issue related to our former leased property in New Jersey, which is currently subject to a remediation stemming from the sale of
property by the previous owner in 2008 to the current landlord. To Management s knowledge, the former landlord has engaged
a licensed site remediation professional and had assumed responsibility for this remediation. In Management s opinion the
liability for this remediation is the responsibility of the former landlord. However, the former landlord has disputed this
position and it is an open issue subject to negotiation. Currently, we have no knowledge as to the scope of the landlord s
former remediation obligation. 

Results of Operations  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net Sales   

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, Net Sales were $4,145,741 compared to $5,526,276 for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $1,380,535, or approximately 25%. The decrease in Net Sales
was due to the impact of the closure of our former New Jersey processing center in December 2015, partially offset by the addition
of new customers. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, Net Sales for the New Jersey facility were approximately
$2,032,000. Although the Company is making an ongoing effort to retain and serve certain customers from its existing facilities
that were previously served by its New Jersey facility, Net Sales may decrease over the next one to two years given the cessation
of the Company s New Jersey facility and our ordinary course of business decision to discontinue non-profitable sales and/or
operations. 

Cost of Goods Sold   

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, our Cost of Goods Sold was $3,968,501, compared to $5,971,400
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $2,002,899, or approximately 34%. The decrease
in Cost of Goods Sold was primarily due to the closure of our former New Jersey processing center in December 2015, partially offset
by costs associated with sales to new customers. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, Cost of Goods Sold for the
New Jersey facility was approximately $2,647,000. 

Gross Profit (Loss)   

For the nine-month period ended September 30,
2016, we realized a gross profit of $177,240, compared to a gross loss of $(445,124) for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. This change is primarily the result of the impact of the closure of our former New Jersey processing center in December
2015. 

Our gross profit margin for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, was approximately 4%, compared to approximately (8)% for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses   

For the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, operating expenses increased to $2,716,773 from $2,219,699 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015,
representing an increase of $497,074, or approximately 22%.  Operating Expenses consist of Consulting Fees,
Share-Based Compensation, Salaries and Wages, Legal and Professional, and General and Administrative Expenses. 

Consulting Fees  consist of
marketing, administrative and management fees incurred under consulting agreements. Consulting Fees decreased to
$114,902 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, from $285,364 for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2015, representing a decrease of $170,462, or 60%. The decrease is primarily due to the change in direction by management to
utilize employees rather than consultants to advance our business. 

Share-Based Compensation  consists
of stock, options and warrants issued to consultants, employees and directors in consideration for services provided to the
Company. Share-Based Compensation increased to $856,848 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, from $798,227 for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $58,621, or 7%.   The increase is due
to changes in the type and amount of awards granted between periods. 

Salaries and Wages  consist of wages
and the related taxes.  Salaries and Wages increased to $816,069 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
from $411,663 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $404,406 or 98%.  The increase
is due to a shift by management to use employees rather than consultants as well as the build out of certain in-house resources,
including sales, marketing and customer service personnel to support the Company s short term and long term growth plans
and technical resources to support the Company s product quality enhancement and production capacity increase efforts. Towards
the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and continuing into the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company increased
its sales and market team, including the hiring of a Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The Company expects that this increase
in personnel will result in an immediate increase in salaries and wages expense and an increase in sales in 2017. 

Legal and Professional Fees  consist
of legal, accounting, tax and audit services.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, Legal and Professional
Fees decreased to $192,152 from $235,972 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $43,820
or approximately 19%. The decrease is primarily attributable to our focus on reducing our reliance on the outsourcing of professional
services and utilizing the abilities of our in-house staff and well as cost savings realized in connection with certain services. 

General and Administrative (G A) Expenses 
consist of general operational costs of our business. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, G A Expenses increased
to $736,802 from $488,473 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $248,329, or approximately
51%.  The increase is primarily due to costs incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2016, related to our New Jersey
processing center that was closed in December 2015, partially offset by cost savings realized across other areas of the Company.
The Company has taken steps to complete the wind down of the New Jersey processing center and eliminate these ongoing costs, including
the reduction of costs in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the first two quarters of 2016. 

Other Income and Expenses   

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, Other Income and Expenses was expense of $2,413 compared
to an expense of $123,337 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a change of $120,924, or approximately
98%. Other Income and Expenses consist primarily of Interest Income and Interest Expense along with a gain on settlement of a note
payable of $15,000 during 2016. The change was primarily due to costs associated with our former New Jersey processing center that
was closed in December 2015 and the gain on settlement. 

Interest Expense  consists of interest
on the Company s outstanding indebtedness.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, Interest Expense
decreased to $17,739 from $123,552 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $105,813 or approximately
86%. The decrease was primarily due to costs associated with our former New Jersey processing center that was closed in December
2015. 

Adjusted EBITDA  

Presented below is the non-GAAP financial measure
representing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation (which we refer to as  Adjusted
EBITDA ). Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for, net income (loss) and cash
flows from operations calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as
an additional measure of our Company s performance for purposes of business decision-making, including developing budgets,
managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help
our management identify additional trends in our Company s financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period
comparisons of net income (loss) and cash flows from operations. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation
programs applicable to many of our employees in order to evaluate our Company s performance. Further, we believe that the
presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their analysis of our results and helps investors make comparisons between
our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and tax attributes,
different capitalized asset values and/or different forms of employee compensation. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA
has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, particularly those items that are recurring in nature. In order to compensate
for those limitations, management also reviews the specific items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, but included in net income
(loss), as well as trends in those items. The amounts of those items are set forth, for the applicable periods, in the reconciliations
of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss below. 

RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net Sales   

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, Net Sales were $1,388,980 compared to $2,141,924 for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $752,944, or approximately 35%. The decrease in Net
Sales was due to the impact of the closure of our former New Jersey processing center in December 2015, partially offset by the
addition of new customers. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, Net Sales for the New Jersey facility were approximately
$952,000. Although the Company is making an ongoing effort to retain and serve certain customers from its existing facilities
that were previously served by its New Jersey facility, Net Sales may decrease over the next one to two years given the cessation
of the Company s New Jersey facility and our ordinary course of business decision to discontinue non-profitable sales and/or
operations. 

Cost of Goods Sold   

For the three-month period ended September
30, 2016, our Costs of Goods Sold was $1,282,507, compared to $2,239,512 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015,
representing a decrease of $957,005, or approximately 43%. The decrease in Cost of Goods Sold was primarily due to the closure
of our former New Jersey processing center in December 2015 partially offset by additional costs associated with new customers.
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, Cost of Goods Sold for the New Jersey facility was approximately $1,223,000. 

Gross Profit (Loss)   

For the three-month period ended September
30, 2016, we realized a gross profit of $106,473, compared to a gross loss of $(97,588) for the three-month period ended September
30, 2015. This change is primarily the result of the impact of the closure of our former New Jersey processing center in December
2015. 

Our gross profit margin for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, was approximately 8%, compared to approximately (5)% for the three-month period ended September
30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses   

For the three-month period ended
September 30, 2016, operating expenses increased to $799,826 from $596,414 for the three-month period ended September 30,
2015, representing an increase of $203,412, or approximately 18%.  Operating Expenses consist of Consulting Fees,
Share-Based Compensation, Salaries and Wages, Legal and Professional, and General and Administrative Expenses. 

Consulting Fees  consist of marketing,
administrative and management fees incurred under consulting agreements. Consulting Fees decreased to $13,479 for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, from $65,592 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $52,113,
or 79%. The decrease is primarily due to the change in direction by management to utilize employees rather than consultants to
advance our business. 

Share-Based Compensation  consists
of stock, options and warrants issued to consultants and employees in consideration for services provided to the Company.
Share-Based Compensation increased to $258,613 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, from $168,128 for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $90,485, or 54%.   The increase is due to
changes in the type and amount of awards granted between periods. 

Salaries and Wages  consist of wages
and the related taxes.  Salaries and Wages increased to $277,058 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016,
from $142,216 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $134,842 or 95%.   The
increase is due to a shift by management to use employees rather than consultants as well as the build out of certain in-house
resources, including sales, marketing and customer service personnel to support the Company s short term and long term growth
plans and technical resources to support the Company s product quality enhancement and production capacity increase efforts.
Towards the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and continuing into the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company increased
its sales and market team, including the hiring of a Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The Company expects that this increase
in personnel will result in an immediate increase in salaries and wages expense and an increase in sales in 2017. 

Legal and Professional Fees  consist
of legal, accounting, tax and audit services.  For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, Legal and Professional
Fees increased to $50,255 from $50,035 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $220. 

General and Administrative (G A) Expenses 
consist of general operational costs of our business. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, G A Expenses increased
to $200,421 from $170,443 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $29,978, or approximately
18%. The decrease is primarily due to ongoing costs related to our New Jersey processing center that was closed in December
2015. The Company is taking steps to complete the wind down of the New Jersey processing center and eliminate these ongoing costs.
The increase is primarily due to costs associated with increased focus in areas such as sales, marketing and customer service as
well as product quality enhancement and production capacity increase efforts. 

Other Income and Expenses   

For the three-month period ended September
30, 2016, Other Income and Expenses was expense of $5,653 compared to an expense of $39,606 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2015, representing a decrease of $33,953, or approximately 86%. Other Income and Expenses consist of Interest Income and Interest
Expense. 

Interest Expense  consists of interest
on the Company s outstanding indebtedness.  For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, Interest Expense
decreased to $5,761 from $39,645 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $33,884 or approximately
85%. The decrease was primarily due to costs associated with our former New Jersey processing center that was closed in December
2015. 

Adjusted EBITDA  

Presented below is the non-GAAP financial measure
representing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation (which we refer to as  Adjusted
EBITDA ). Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for, net income (loss) and cash
flows from operations calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as
an additional measure of our Company s performance for purposes of business decision-making, including developing budgets,
managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help
our management identify additional trends in our Company s financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period
comparisons of net income (loss) and cash flows from operations. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation
programs applicable to many of our employees in order to evaluate our Company s performance. Further, we believe that the
presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their analysis of our results and helps investors make comparisons between
our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and tax attributes,
different capitalized asset values and/or different forms of employee compensation. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA
has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, particularly those items that are recurring in nature. In order to compensate
for those limitations, management also reviews the specific items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, but included in net income
(loss), as well as trends in those items. The amounts of those items are set forth, for the applicable periods, in the reconciliations
of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss below. 

RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA  

Liquidity   Capital Resources; Going
Concern  

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability
to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity
are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of businesses and technologies.  Cash
provided from financing continues to be the Company s primary source of funds. We believe that we can raise adequate funds
through issuance of equity or debt as necessary to continue to support our planned expansion. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $1,918,821 and $2,592,914, respectively.  The decrease
in cash used in operating activities is due to the decrease in our net loss as well as significant period over period changes
in accounts receivables, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses and depreciation and amortization. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $449,698 in cash for investing activities, compared to the $143,389
used in the prior year s period.  These amounts were comprised of capital expenditures for equipment as well
as the acquisition of Brian s On-Site Recycling. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received
$2,802,105 and $3,300,676, respectively, in cash from financing activities. The decrease is due to the funds received from a
private placement offering in February 2015 exceeding the funds received from the rights offering conducted in February 2016,
which are both discussed further below, as well as the repayment of debt. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $2,790,006
in current assets, including $1,710,273 in cash, $657,827 in accounts receivable and $235,990 in inventories. Cash increased from
$1,276,687 as of December 31, 2015, to $1,710,273 as of September 30, 2016, primarily due to the rights offering in February 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had total current
liabilities of $1,161,241 consisting primarily of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $907,864. As of September 30, 2016,
we had total non-current liabilities of $191,067, consisting primarily of the non-current portion of our notes payable obligations
of $186,298. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
has yet to achieve profitable operations and is dependent on our ability to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to
sustain operations and to ultimately achieve profitable operations. 

Our plans to address these matters include
achieving profitable operations, raising additional financing through offering our shares of the Company's capital stock in private
and/or public offerings of our securities and through debt financing if available and needed. There can be no assurances, however,
that the Company will be able to obtain any financings or that such financings will be sufficient to sustain our business operation
or permit the Company to implement our intended business strategy. We plan to achieve profitable operations through the implementation
of operating efficiencies at our facilities and increased revenue through the offering of additional products and the expansion
of our geographic footprint through acquisitions, broader distribution from our current facilities and/or the opening of additional
facilities. 

In their report dated April 1, 2016, our independent
registered public accounting firm included an emphasis-of-matter paragraph with respect to our consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015 concerning the Company's assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is an issue raised as a result of current working capital requirements and recurring losses from
operations. 

The table below sets forth certain information
about the Company s liquidity and capital resources for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The Company may not have sufficient capital
to sustain expected operations for the next twelve months. To date, we financed operations and investing activities through private
sales of our securities exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we completed a rights offering and raised net proceeds of $2,936,792, which is discussed further below. 

Private Placement in February 2015   

On February 17, 2015, the Company completed
a private placement offering (the  Offering ) of units of the Company s securities (the  Units )
at a price of $0.325 per Unit, with each Unit consisting of one share of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share. In connection with the Offering, the Company entered into subscription agreements with eighteen (18) accredited investors
and one (1) non-accredited investor (collectively, the  Investors ), pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investors,
for an aggregate purchase price of $3,581,875, a total of 11,021,170 Units, consisting of 11,021,170 shares of common stock. 

The Company utilized the services of a FINRA
registered placement agent (the  Placement Agent ) for the Offering. In connection with the Offering, the Company paid
an aggregate cash fee of $34,827 to the Placement Agent and issued to the Placement Agent five-year stock options to purchase up
to 107,160 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.325 per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering,
after deducting the foregoing cash fee and other expenses related to the Offering, were $3,547,048. 

Rights Offering in February 2016   

On February 26, 2016, the Company closed a
rights offering (the  Rights Offering ). The rights offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared effective on January 20, 2016. 

Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company
distributed to holders of its common stock non-transferable subscription rights to purchase up to 50,200,947 shares of the Company s
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Each shareholder received one subscription right for every one share of common stock
owned at 5:00 p.m. EST on October 30, 2015, the record date. Each subscription right entitled a shareholder to purchase 0.7 shares
of the Company s common stock at a subscription price of $0.08 per share, which was referred to as the basic subscription
privilege. If a shareholder fully exercised their basic subscription privilege and other shareholders did not fully exercise their
basic subscription privileges, shareholders could also exercise an over-subscription privilege to purchase a portion of the unsubscribed
shares at the same subscription price of $0.08 per share. 

During the Rights Offering, subscription rights to purchase a total of 37,475,620 shares of common stock,
par value $0.0001, were exercised. The exercise of these subscription rights resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $2,998,050
before deducting expenses associated with the rights offering. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  

None. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Not Applicable. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our
periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial
Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

As
of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, management concluded
that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Our
management has previously identified a material weakness regarding a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that creates a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
in a timely manner. The material weakness related to our Company was due to not having adequate personnel to address the reporting
requirements of a public company and to fully analyze and account for our transactions. The Company made progress to remedy this
deficiency through retaining accounting staff members with public company experience. However, due to the limited time that these
controls have been in place, we believe that our disclosure controls remain ineffective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.  

On January 8, 2016, Acquisition Sub. #4 filed
a civil action against Onyxx Group LLC in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida. This civil action relates to an outstanding
balance due from Onyxx Group LLC to Acquisition Sub. #4. In September 2016, the Company received a favorable judgment regarding
this civil action in the amount of $95,000. 

On March 22, 2016, Acquisition Sub. #4 filed
a civil action against Encore Petroleum, LLC in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division, Hudson County. This civil action
relates to an outstanding balance due from Encore Petroleum to Acquisition Sub. #4. This civil action is still pending. 

The Company is also aware of one matter that involves an alleged claim against the Company, and it is at least
reasonably possible that the claim will be pursued. The claim involves contracts with our former director and his related entities
that provided services and was our landlord for the Company s former processing facility in New Jersey. In this matter, the
landlord of the Company s formerly leased property claims back rent is due for property used by the Company outside of the
scope of its lease agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the former landlord denied the Company access to the New
Jersey facility and prepared an eviction notice. The Company negotiated a payment in the amount of $250,000 to regain access to
the facility, and reached an accord to negotiate with the landlord to resolve the outstanding issues by May 31, 2015. On December
28, 2015, the Company ultimately approved the termination of the lease agreements related to the New Jersey facility, thereby ceasing
all operations at that particular facility. This termination was prompted by the former landlord s demand for payment of
approximately $2.3 million to maintain access to the facility. In September 2016, the Company reached an agreement with the landlord.
The agreement required the Company to resolve certain environmental issues regarding the former processing facility and make certain
payments to the landlord. The Company, the landlord and their related entities also agreed to a full and final settlement of existing
and possible futures claims between the parties. As of November 14, 2016, the Company believes it has addressed the environmental
issues by removing and disposing of the waste from the facility and cleaning the storage tanks. Additionally, as of November 14,
2016, the Company has paid $295,000 of the agreed upon $335,000 payment to the landlord. The remaining $40,000 will be paid to
the landlord upon resolution of related pending regulatory matters, subject to certain additional terms. Because the Company had
already fully reserved for this contingency, the agreement s execution did not result in an additional expense to the Company
in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.  

There have been no changes that constitute
a material change from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 4, 2016.

the investors had sufficient sophistication and knowledge of the Company and the financing transaction, and the issuance did not
involve any form of general solicitation or general advertising. The investors made investment representations that the shares
were taken for investment purposes and not with a view to resale.
