1 - Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation   

A.   
       Nature
    of Operations    

Zion
Oil   Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( we,   our,   Zion  or the  Company )
is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of more than 16 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had no revenues from its oil and gas operations.  

Exploration
Rights/Exploration Activities    

Zion currently holds one active petroleum
exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License ( MJL ), comprising approximately 99,000 acres.
The Company has selected the specific drill pad location from which to drill its next exploration well, which, unless extended,
must be spud by December 1, 2016 as referenced below. The drilling of this well to the desired depth is subject to the Company
raising sufficient funds from equity or debt offerings, of which no assurance can be provided. 

Megiddo-Jezreel
Petroleum License ( MJL )    

The
MJL was awarded on December 3, 2013 for a three-year primary term through December 2, 2016, with the possibility of additional
one-year extensions up to a maximum of seven years. The MJL is onshore, south and west of the Sea of Galilee.  

On
June 28, 2016, the Company submitted a third Application for Extension of Drilling Date, and on July 4, 2016, the Petroleum Commissioner
formally approved the application as follows:  

The Petroleum Commissioner modified Zion s
work plan deadlines and awarded the Company a one-year extension to December 2, 2017, on its Megiddo-Jezreel petroleum exploration
license, subject to Zion signing a drilling contract and submitting a detailed engineering plan by October 13, 2016 and spudding
an exploratory well by December 1, 2016. The Company timely complied with two key Special Conditions of our existing license terms
established by the Israel Petroleum Commissioner, by providing on October 13, 2016 the fully executed drilling contract with S.A.
Daflog, S.R.L. (dated 6 October 2016) and a Detailed Drilling Engineering Plan for the Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well. Zion entered into
a drilling contract with S.A. DAFLOG S.R.L., an Israeli-registered related party entity to DAFORA S.A. 

As previously reported, the Company
needed authorization from the Israel land Authority (the  ILA ), the formal lessor of the land to the kibbutz, to access
and utilize the drill site. The Company received this authority on July 4, 2016; this authority is effective through January 3,
2017. This is in conjunction with our May 15, 2016, signed agreement with Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu on whose property the drilling pad
will be situated. 

The drill site plan is being
prepared by an outside engineering firm to accommodate DAFORA s F-400 Rig which was commissioned by us for the
drilling. The Company has awarded the drill site construction contract to an Israeli company named  Y. Bazelet and
Aggregatim LTD . The final step in the process is for Zion to submit the revised drill site plan along with our
Application to Drill for final drilling program approval. Drill site construction is planned to start in November and it
should take approximately 45-60 days to complete.  Upon completion of the access road and drill site, we hope to
commence rig mobilization to the MJ#1 location to begin rig-up and acceptance testing, assuming no weather or regulatory
delays. The drilling, completion and testing of the well will be subject to raising the necessary capital of which no
assurances can be provided.

Note
1 - Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation  (cont d)   

While Zion has successfully complied with
the Special Conditions of the Company s work program to date, the process of securing an appropriate drilling rig and crew
with which to drill our upcoming well has been long and complicated. As such, Zion submitted a drilling date extension request
to the Petroleum Commissioner on November 7, 2016. Key details of the extension request are as outlined below: 

No
assurance can be given that this extension request will be granted.   

Zion s
Former Jordan Valley, Joseph, and Asher-Menashe Licenses   

On
March 29, 2015, the Energy Ministry formally approved the Company s application to merge the southernmost portion of the
Jordan Valley License into the Megiddo-Jezreel License. The Company has plugged all of its exploratory wells (in the former Joseph
and Asher-Menashe Licenses) but acknowledges its obligation to complete the abandonment of these well sites in accordance with
guidance from the Environmental Ministry and local officials.  

B.   
       Basis
    of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Zion Oil   Gas, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with
Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals necessary for
a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows, have been included. The information included in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year-end balance sheet data presented
for comparative purposes was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other subsequent interim period.  

To
date, the Company has not achieved a discovery of either oil or natural gas in commercial quantities. The Company incurs cash
outflows from operations and all exploration activities and overhead expenses to date have been financed by way of equity and
debt financing. The recoverability of the costs incurred to date is uncertain and dependent upon achieving significant commercial
production.  

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to undertake further
exploration and development activities and ultimately generating profitable operations from its oil and natural gas interests
in the future. The Company s current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of its current assets to meet its current
expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially
incorrect, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern may be impaired. The financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $6.7 million and had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $148.8 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern.  

The Company expects to incur additional
significant expenditures to further its exploration program. Management is of the opinion that available cash resources are
sufficient to finance its plan of operations through January 2017 (See Note 3E). 

To carry out further planned operations
beyond that date, the Company must raise additional funds through additional equity and/or debt issuances. There can be no assurance
that this capital will be available to the Company, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to curtail or cease exploration
and development activities, including the drilling of the planned MJL exploratory well. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

A.   
       Net
    Loss per Share Data    

Basic and diluted net loss per share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Common Stock ), is presented in conformity with ASC 260-10
 Earnings Per Share.  Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share as the inclusion of
5,915,442 and 5,280,311  Common
Stock equivalents in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, would be anti-dilutive.  

B.   
       Use
    of Estimates    

The
preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying
assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of unproved oil and gas properties, deferred tax assets,
asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates
and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors,
including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts
such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency,
and energy markets have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and
their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in
those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in
future periods.  

C.   
       Oil
    and Gas Properties and Impairment    

The  Company
follows the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration
and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized.  

All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties,
including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates
of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves
associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties
are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted
carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method. 

The
Company s oil and gas property represents an investment in unproved properties. These costs are excluded from the amortized
cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed
at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve
base has not yet been established. Impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results,
relinquishing drilling rights or other information.  

Currently,
the Company has no economically recoverable reserves and no amortization base. The Company s unproved oil and gas properties
consist of capitalized exploration costs of $6,053,000 and $5,022,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

D.   
       Fair
    Value Considerations    

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  as amended
by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Financial Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 and related guidance. Those provisions relate
to the Company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and the fair value disclosures related to financial
assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, expands related disclosure requirements, and specifies a hierarchy of valuation
techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date, assuming the transaction occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.  

There are three levels of inputs
to fair value measurements - Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, meaning
the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, meaning the use of unobservable inputs.  

E.   
       Derivative
    Liabilities    

In accordance with ASC 815-40-25 and ASC 815-10-15
Derivatives and Hedging and ASC 480-10-25 Liabilities-Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the embedded derivatives associated
with the Convertible Bonds are accounted for as a liability during the term of the related Convertible Bonds.

F.   
       Recently
    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    

The Company does not believe that the adoption
of any recently issued accounting pronouncements in 2016 had a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations,
or cash flow, except for ASC Update No. 2015-03 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. For public business
entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

The
following table sets forth information about the weighted-average fair value of options granted to non-employees during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, using the Black Scholes option-pricing model and the weighted-average assumptions used
for such grants:  

The
risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with
the expected life of the options.  

The
expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected
life of the options granted to employees and directors is calculated based on the Simplified Method as allowed under Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 110 ( SAB 110 ), giving consideration to the contractual term of the options and their
vesting schedules, as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data at this time. The expected life of the option
granted to non-employees equals their contractual term. In the case of an extension of the option life, the calculation was made
on the basis of the extended life.

E.   
       Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DSPP )    

O n
March 27, 2014, the Company launched its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the  DSPP ) pursuant to which
stockholders and interested investors can purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock as well as units of the Company s
securities. The terms of the DSPP are described in the Prospectus Supplement originally filed on March 31, 2014 (the  Original
Prospectus Supplement ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) under the Company s effective
registration Statement on Form S-3, as thereafter amended. On January 13, 2015, the Company amended the Original Prospectus Supplement
( Amendment No. 3 ) to provide for a unit option (the  Unit Option ) under the DSPP comprised of one share
of Common Stock and three Common Stock purchase warrants with each unit priced at $4.00. Each warrant afforded the investor or
stockholder the opportunity to purchase the Company s Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00. Each of the three
warrant series have different expiration dates that have been extended.  

On
December 28, 2015, Amendment No. 6 to the Original Prospectus Supplement was filed extending the scheduled termination date of
the Unit Option to March 31, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the Unit Option terminated. The number of warrants are not of a sufficient
quantity to justify OTC (over the counter) trading.  

The warrants became first exercisable on
May 2, 2016 and continue to be exercisable through May 2, 2017 for ZNWAB (1 year), May 2, 2018 for ZNWAC (2 years) and May 2,
2019 for ZNWAD (3 years), respectively, at a per share exercise price of $1.00. The Company issued approximately 120,000 shares
of its Common Stock as of September 30, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $120,000. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, approximately $2,680,000 has been raised under the DSPP program. As a result, the Company issued approximately 1,578,000

A.   
       Litigation    

From
time to time, the Company may be subject to routine litigation, claims, or disputes in the ordinary course of business. The Company
defends itself vigorously in all such matters. In the opinion of management, no pending or known threatened claims, actions or
proceedings against the Company are expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such litigation or investigatory
matters or any other pending litigation or claims. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits and
investigations.  

B.   
       Environmental and
    Onshore Licensing Regulatory Matters    

The Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration
and production and may become subject to certain liabilities as they relate to environmental cleanup of well sites or other environmental
restoration procedures and other obligations as they relate to the drilling of oil and gas wells or the operation thereof. Various
guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel s Petroleum Commissioner and Energy and Environmental Ministries
since 2012 as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention of these guidelines were included in previous Zion Oil   Gas
filings.

5 - Commitments and Contingencies  (cont d)  

On
May 16, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for the preparation and submission of a drilling program in accordance
with industry best practices or  Good Oilfield Practice.   

On
May 17, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for production testing in accordance with  Good Industry Practice 
detailing the applicable measures and reporting requirements.  

On
June 28, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for occupational health and safety practices regarding oil and gas
drilling and production activities per international norms, coupled with Israeli legal safety guidelines. These regulations focus
on industry best practices in the area of health, safety, and environmental (HS E) factors as well as risk management. In
addition, there is a new requirement to have the Petroleum Commissioner s approval over the safety standards which the operator
seeks to apply.  

The
Company believes that these new regulations are likely increase the expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights
and drilling new wells. The company expects that additional financial burden could occur as a result of requiring cash reserves
that could otherwise be used for operational purposes. These new regulations are likely to increase the time needed to obtain
all of the necessary authorizations and approvals prior to drilling.  

C.    
       Bank
    Guarantees    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company provided bank guarantees to various governmental bodies (approximately $1,121,000) and others
(approximately $80,000) in respect of its drilling operation in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,201,000. The funds backing
these guarantees and additional amounts added to support currency fluctuations as required by the bank are held in interest-bearing
accounts and are reported on the Company s balance sheets as  restricted cash.

Rights
Offering -10% Senior Convertible Notes due May 2, 2021   

On October 21, 2015, the Company filed with
the SEC a prospectus supplement for a rights offering. Under the rights offering, the Company distributed at no cost, 360,000
non-transferable subscription rights to subscribe for, on a per right basis, two 10% Convertible Senior Bonds par $100 due May
2, 2021 (the  Notes ), to persons who owned shares of the Company s Common Stock on October 15, 2015, the record
date for the offering. Each whole subscription right entitled the participant to purchase two convertible bonds at a purchase
price of $100 per bond. Effective October 21, 2015, the Company executed a Supplemental Indenture, as issuer, with the American
Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, a New York limited liability trust company ( AST ), as trustee for the Notes
(the  Indenture ). 

The
offering was scheduled to terminate on January 15, 2016 but was extended to March 31, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the rights offering
terminated.  

On
May 2, 2016, the Company issued approximately $3,470,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes   in
connection with the rights offering. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $3,334,000, from the sale of the Notes,
after deducting fees and expenses of $136,000 incurred in connection with the offering. These costs have been discounted as deferred
offering costs.   

The
Notes contain a convertible option that gives rise to a derivative liability, which is accounted for separately from the Notes
(see below and Note 8). Accordingly, the Notes were initially recognized at fair value of approximately $1,844,000, which represents
the principal amount of $3,470,000 from which a debt discount of approximately $1,626,000 (which is equal to the fair value of
the convertible option) was deducted.   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $12,000 in amortization expense related to the deferred financing costs, and
approximately $65,000 in debt discount amortization, net. The Notes are governed by the terms of the Indenture. The Notes are
senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, payable annually in arrears on May 2
of each year, commencing May 2, 2017. The Notes will mature on May 2, 2021, unless earlier redeemed by the Company or converted
by the holder. 

Interest and principal may be paid, at the
Company s option, in cash or in shares of the Company s Common Stock. The number of shares for the payment of interest
in shares of Common Stock, in lieu of the cash amount, will be based on the average of the closing prices of the Company s
Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg L.P. for the 30 trading days preceding the record date for the payment of interest; such
record date has been designated and will always be the 10 th  business day prior to the interest payment date on May
2 of each year. The number of shares for the payment of principal, in lieu of the cash amount, shall be based upon the average
of the closing price of the Company s Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg L.P. for the 30 trading days preceding the principal
repayment date; such record date has been designated as the trading day immediately prior to the 30-day period preceding the maturity
date of May 2, 2021. Fractional shares will not be issued and the final number of shares will be rounded up to the next whole
share. 

At
any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 2, 2021, holders may convert their notes
into Common Stock at the conversion rate of 44 shares per $100 bond (which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately
$2.27 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including,
but not limited to, the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends.  

Beginning
May 3, 2018, the Company is entitled to redeem for cash the outstanding Notes at an amount equal to the principal and accrued
and unpaid interest, plus a 10% premium. No  sinking fund  is provided for the Notes due May 2021, which means
that the Company is not required to periodically redeem or retire the Notes due May 2021.  

Through
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 125 convertible bonds of $100 each have been converted under this offering
at a conversion rate of approximately $2.27 per share. As a result, the Company issued approximately 5,500 shares of its Common
Stock during the same period.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized interest expense of approximately $144,000 related to the Notes, Payable for the first time and in arrears on May 2, 2017.

On Ma y
31, 2016, the Company filed with the SEC a Prospectus Supplement, as subsequently amended on June 22, 2016 and August 30, 2016
for an offering of the Company s 12% Convertible Senior Bonds due 2028 (the  Bonds;  each, a  Bond )
in a minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000,  on a  best efforts minimum/maximum offering,   up
to a maximum amount of $12,000,000 (the  Follow On Public Offering ). The Follow On Public Offering was made available
through Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. ( Network 1 ) and other licensed broker/dealers. The  best efforts 
public offering period was scheduled to continue through September 1, 2016. This conditional closing was subject to extension
by the Company, in its sole discretion, for an additional 60 day period to which the Company elected, thereby extending the closing
to November 1, 2016. All offering proceeds were deposited into an escrow account at Ocean First Bank, which acted as the escrow
agent for the  best efforts  offering.  

On
November 1, 2016, the Company closed its public bond offering. The minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000 was not reached as of
the November 1, 2016 closing date. Ocean First Bank has been authorized and directed to promptly return invested funds, without
deduction, to the rightful owners.  

In
connection with the  best efforts  offe ring, the Company incurred to date approximately $83,000 of deferred
issuance costs, which primarily consisted of underwriter fees, legal and other professional service fees.

Note
8 - Derivative Liability   

The Notes issued by the Company and
discussed in Note 6 contain a convertible option that gives rise to a derivative liability. 

The debt instrument the Company issued
includes a make-whole provision, which provides that in the event of conversion by the investor under certain circumstances, the
issuer is required to deliver to the holder additional consideration beyond the settlement of the conversion obligation. 

Because
time value make-whole provisions are not clearly and closely related to the debt host and would meet the definition of a derivative
if considered freestanding, they should be evaluated under the indexation guidance to determine whether they would be afforded
the scope exception pursuant to ASC 815-10-15-74(a). This evaluation is generally performed in conjunction with the analysis of
the embedded conversion feature.  

The
Company has measured its derivative liability at fair value and recognized the derivative value as a current liability and recorded
the derivative value on its balance sheet. The fair value of the shares to be issued upon conversion of the Notes was recorded
as a derivative liability, with the change in the fair value recorded as a gain or loss in the accompanying statement of operations.  

The
valuation of the Notes was done by using the Binomial Model, a well-accepted option-pricing model, and based on the Notes 
terms and other parameters the Company identified as relevant for the valuation of the Notes  Fair Value.  

The
Binomial Model used the forecast of the Company share price during the Note s contractual term.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s liabilities that are measured at fair value are as follows:  

Change
in value of derivative liability during 2016 are as follows:  

The
following table presents the assumptions that were used for the model as of September 30, 2016:  

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded unrealized gains of approximately $583,000 (net) within the Statements of Operations line item, gain
on derivative liability.

Overview    

Zion
Oil and Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of over 16 years of oil and gas
exploration in Israel. We were incorporated in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed
our initial public offering in January 2007. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Common Stock ) currently
trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol  ZN  and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol  ZNWAA.   

Zion
currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License ( MJL ), comprising
approximately 99,000 acres. The Company has selected the specific drill pad location from which to drill its next exploration
well, which, unless granted an extension, must be spudded by December 1, 2016 as referenced below.  

At
present, we have no revenues or operating income. Our ability to generate future revenues and operating cash flow will depend
on the successful exploration and exploitation of our current and any future petroleum rights or the acquisition of oil and/or
gas producing properties, and the volume and timing of such production. In addition, even if we are successful in producing oil
and/or gas in commercial quantities, our results will depend upon commodity prices for oil and/or gas, as well as operating expenses,
including taxes and royalties.  

Our
executive offices are located at 12655 North Central Expressway, Suite 1000, Dallas, Texas 75243, and our telephone number is
(214) 221-4610. Our branch office s address in Israel is 9 Halamish Street, North Industrial Park, Caesarea 3088900, and
the telephone number is +972-4-623-8500. Our website address is: www.zionoil.com.  

Current
Exploration and Operation Efforts    

Megiddo-Jezreel
Petroleum License   

We
were awarded the Megiddo-Jezreel License, No. 401 ( MJL ) on December 3, 2013 for a three-year primary term through
December 2, 2016 with the possibility of additional one-year extensions up to a maximum of seven years. The MJL is onshore, south
and west of the Sea of Galilee.  

Map
1. Zion s Megiddo-Jezreel Petroleum Exploration License as of October, 2016.   

On
June 28, 2016, the Company submitted a third Application for Extension of Drilling Date, and on July 4, 2016, the Petroleum Commissioner
formally approved the application as follows:  

The
Petroleum Commissioner modified Zion s MJL work plan deadlines and awarded the Company a one-year extension to December
2, 2017, subject to Zion signing a drilling contract and submitting a detailed engineering plan by October 13, 2016, and spudding
an exploratory well by December 1, 2016.   

The
Company timely complied with two key special conditions of our existing license terms established by Israel s Petroleum
Commissioner, by providing on October 13, 2016 the fully executed drilling contract with S.A. Daflog, S.R.L. (dated 6 October
2016) and a detailed Drilling Engineering Plan for the Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well.  

Zion
entered into a drilling contract with S.A. DAFLOG S.R.L., an Israeli-registered related party entity to DAFORA S.A. DAFORA is
the largest drilling company in Romania and has drilled over 1,000 wells in Romania, Eastern Europe and East Africa. Zion will
use DAFORA s F-400 drilling rig which has a 3,000 HP capacity drawworks capable of drilling to over 7,000 meters. This provides
sufficient horsepower and safety factor to drill our planned well with a target depth of up to 4,500 meters. The DAFORA rig and
most of its major components are currently stored in Israel, at Givot Olam s Meged-8 drill site.  

As
previously reported, the Company needed authorization from the Israel land Authority (the  ILA ), the formal lessor
of the land to the kibbutz, to access and utilize the drill site. On August 16, 2016, the Company signed the agreement with the
ILA to access and utilize the drill site. This is in conjunction with our May 15, 2016, signed agreement with Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu
on whose property the drilling pad will be situated.  

The drill site
plan is being prepared by an outside engineering firm to accommodate DAFORA s F-400 Rig. The Company has awarded the
drill site construction contract to an Israeli company named  Y. Bazelet and Aggregatim LTD . The final step in the
process is for Zion to submit the drill site plan along with our Application to Drill for final drilling program approval.
Drill site construction is planned to start in November, and it should take approximately 45-60 days to complete.  Upon
completion of the access road and drill site, we plan to commence rig mobilization to the MJ#1 location to begin rig-up and
acceptance testing, assuming no weather or regulatory delays. The drilling, completion and testing of the well will be
subject to raising the necessary capital of which no assurances can be provided. As of the date of this report, the Company
does not have the cash resources to both spud and drill the MJL to the desired total depth. 

While
Zion has successfully complied with the Special Conditions of the Company s work program to date, the process of
securing an appropriate drilling rig and crew with which to drill our upcoming well has been long and complicated. As such,
Zion submitted a drilling date extension request to the Petroleum Commissioner on November 7, 2016. Key details of the extension
request are outlined below:  

While
no assurance can be given that this extension request will be granted, Zion is optimistic that the request will be favorably received
by the Petroleum Commissioner.  

Depending
on the results of the planned exploratory well and subject to adequate cash resources at the time, multiple wells could be drilled
from this pad site, as several subsurface geologic targets can be reached using directional well trajectories.  

Zion s
Former Asher-Menashe and Joseph Licenses   

Zion
has plugged all of its exploratory wells on its former Asher-Menashe and Joseph License areas and the reserve pits have been evacuated,
but acknowledges its obligation to complete the abandonment of these well sites in accordance with guidance from the Energy Ministry,
Environmental Ministry and local officials. We continue to make significant progress toward fully abandoning all these sites and
currently await Environmental Ministry permission to move forward.     

Onshore
Licensing, Oil and Gas Exploration and Environmental Guidelines    

The
Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and may become subject to certain liabilities as they relate to environmental
cleanup of well sites or other environmental restoration procedures and other obligations as they relate to the drilling of oil
and gas wells or the operation thereof. Various guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel s Petroleum
Commissioner, the Energy Ministry, and the Environmental Ministry since 2012 as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention
of these guidelines were included in previous Zion Oil   Gas filings.  

On
May 16, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for the preparation and submission of a drilling program in accordance
with industry best practices or  Good Oilfield Practice.   

On
May 17, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for production testing in accordance with  Good Industry Practice 
and detailing the applicable measures and reporting requirements.  

On
June 28, 2016, the Energy Ministry issued new guidelines for occupational health and safety practices regarding oil and gas
drilling and production activities per international norms, coupled with Israeli legal safety guidelines. These regulations focus
on industry best practices in the area of health, safety, and environmental (HS E) factors as well as risk management. In
addition, there is a new requirement to have the Petroleum Commissioner s approval over the safety standards which the operator
seeks to apply.  

We
believe that these new regulations are likely to increase the expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights and
drilling new wells. The company expects that an additional financial burden could occur as a result of requiring cash reserves
that could otherwise be used for operational purposes. These new regulations are likely to increase the time needed to obtain
all of the necessary authorizations and approvals prior to drilling.  

Capital
Resources Highlights   

We
need to raise significant funds to finance the drilling and testing of our next exploratory well and maintain orderly operations.
To date, we have funded our operations through the issuance of our securities and convertible debt. We will need to continue to
raise funds through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities).
No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising the needed equity on terms favorable to us (or at all).  

The
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan   

On
March 27, 2014, we launched our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the  DSPP ) pursuant to which stockholders
and interested investors can purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock as well as units of the Company s securities.
The terms of the DSPP are described in the Prospectus Supplement originally filed on March 31, 2014 (the  Original Prospectus
Supplement ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) under the Company s effective registration
Statement on Form S-3, as thereafter amended. On January 13, 2015, Zion amended the Original Prospectus Supplement ( Amendment
No. 3 ) to provide for a unit option (the  Unit Option ) under the DSPP comprised of one share of Common Stock
and three Common Stock purchase warrants with each unit priced at $4.00. Each warrant afforded the investor or stockholder the
opportunity to purchase the Company s Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00. Each of the three warrant series
have different expiration dates that have been extended.  

On
December 28, 2015, Amendment No. 6 to the Original Prospectus Supplement was filed extending the scheduled termination date of
the Unit Option to March 31, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the Unit Option terminated. The number of warrants are not of a sufficient
quantity to justify OTC (over the counter) trading.  

The
warrants became first exercisable on May 2, 2016 and continue to be exercisable through May 2, 2017 for ZNWAB (1 year), May 2,
2018 for ZNWAC (2 years) and May 2, 2019 for ZNWAD (3 years), respectively, at a per share exercise price of $1.00. As a result
of exercising warrants, Zion issued approximately 120,000 shares of its Common Stock during 2016, resulting in cash proceeds
of approximately $120,000.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $2,680,000 has been raised under the DSPP program. As a result, Zion issued
approximately 1,578,000 shares of its Common Stock during the same period.  

Additionally,
warrants for approximately 286,000 shares of Common Stock were issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (approximately
95,000 each of ZNWAB, ZNWAC, and ZNWAD). The total amount of funds received from the DSPP, including the exercise of warrants,
from the inception date through September 30, 2016 is approximately $11,488,000.  

New
Unit Option under the Unit Program   

Under
our DSPP, as of November 1, 2016 and through January 31, 2017, we are offering a new unit option (the  Unit Program )
pursuant to which stockholders and interested investors can purchase units comprised of seven (7) shares of Common Stock and seven
(7) Common Stock purchase warrants, at a per unit purchase price of $10. The warrant shall have the symbol  ZNWAE, 
but no assurance can be provided that the warrants will be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market. The Company s
new unit option program is scheduled to terminate on January 31, 2017 (unless extended at the Company s sole discretion).  

The
warrants will first become exercisable on March 3, 2017, which is the 31 st  day following the unit option program termination
date (i.e., on January 31, 2017), unless extended, and continue to be exercisable through March 3, 2020 at a per share exercise
price of $1.00. If the Common Stock of the Company closes above $5.00 per share for fifteen (15) consecutive trading days at any
time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company, at its sole discretion, may provide a notice to warrant holders
of an early termination of the warrant within sixty (60) days of the notice. No change will be made to the warrant exercise price
of $1.00 per share.  

10%
Senior Convertible Notes due May 2, 2021   

On
October 21, 2015, we filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement for a rights offering. Under the rights offering, the Company
distributed at no cost, 360,000 non-transferable subscription rights to subscribe for, on a per right basis, two 10% Convertible
Senior Bonds par $100 due May 2, 2021 (the  Notes ), to persons who owned shares of the Company s Common Stock
on October 15, 2015, the record date for the offering. Each whole subscription right entitled the participant to purchase two
convertible bonds at a purchase price of $100 per bond. Effective October 21, 2015, the Company executed a Supplemental Indenture,
as issuer, with the American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, a New York limited liability trust company ( AST ),
as trustee for the Notes (the  Indenture ).  

The
offering was originally scheduled to terminate on January 15, 2016 but was extended to March 31, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the
rights offering terminated.  

On
May 2, 2016 Zion issued approximately $3,470,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes    in connection with the rights
offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $3,334,000, from the sale of the Notes, after deducting fees and expenses
of $136,000 incurred in connection with the offering. These costs have been discounted as deferred offering costs. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $12,000 in amortization expense related to the deferred financing
costs, plus approximately $65,000 in debt discount amortization (net), and approximately $583,000 in a gain on derivative liability
(see  Fair Value Considerations  section for more insight). The Notes are governed by the terms of the Indenture.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, payable annually in arrears
on May 2 of each year, commencing May 2, 2017. The Notes will mature on May 2, 2021, unless earlier redeemed by us or converted
by the holder.  

Interest
and principal may be paid, at our option, in cash or in shares of Zion s Common Stock. The number of shares for the payment
of interest in shares of Common Stock, in lieu of the cash amount, will be based on the average of the closing prices of Zion s
Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg L.P. for the 30 trading days preceding the record date for the payment of interest; such
record date has been designated and will always be the 10 th  business day prior to the interest payment date on May
2 of each year. The number of shares for the payment of principal, in lieu of the cash amount, shall be based upon the average
of the closing price of Zion s Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg L.P. for the 30 trading days preceding the principal
repayment date; such record date has been designated as the trading day immediately prior to the 30-day period preceding the maturity
date of May 2, 2021. Fractional shares will not be issued, and the final number of shares will be rounded up to the next whole
share.  

At
any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 2, 2021, holders may convert their notes
into Common Stock at the conversion rate of 44 shares per $100 bond (which is equivalent to a conversion rate of $2.27 per share).
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited
to, the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends.  

Beginning May
3, 2018, the Company is entitled to redeem for cash the outstanding Notes due May 2021 at an amount equal to the principal
and accrued and unpaid interest, plus a 10% premium. No  sinking fund  is provided for the Notes, which means
that the Company is not required to periodically redeem or retire the Notes due May 2021. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized interest expense of approximately $144,000 related to the Notes
due May 2021, payable for the first time and in arrears on May 2, 2017.  

Through the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, approximately 125 convertible bonds of $100 each have been converted under this offering at a conversion
rate of approximately $2.27 per share. As a result, the Company issued approximately 5,500 shares of its Common Stock during the
same period. 

12%
Senior Convertible Bonds due December 2, 2028   

On
May 31, 2016, the Company filed with the SEC a Prospectus Supplement, as subsequently amended on June 22, 2016 and August 30,
2016 for an offering of the Company s 12% Convertible Senior Bonds due 2028 (the  Bonds;  each, a  Bond )
in a minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000,  on a  best efforts minimum/maximum offering,   up
to a maximum amount of $12,000,000 (the  Follow On Public Offering ). The Follow On Public Offering was made available
through Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. ( Network 1 ) and other licensed broker/dealers. The  best efforts 
public offering period was scheduled to continue through September 1, 2016. This conditional closing was subject to extension
by the Company, in its sole discretion, for an additional 60 day period to which the Company elected, thereby extending the closing
to November 1, 2016. All offering proceeds were deposited into an escrow account at Ocean First Bank, which acted as the escrow
agent for the  best efforts  offering.  

On
November 1, 2016, the Company closed its public bond offering. The minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000 was not reached as of
the November 1, 2016 closing date. Ocean First Bank has been authorized and directed to promptly return invested funds, without
deduction, to the rightful owners.  

In
connection with the  best efforts  offering, the Company incurred to date approximately $83,000 of deferred issuance
costs, which primarily consisted of underwriter fees, legal and other professional service fees.  

Principal
Components of our Cost Structure   

Our
operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following:  

Impairment
    of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties:  Impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will
    not be able to be commercially productive.  The amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as
    well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to Israeli regulatory authorities.   

General
    and Administrative Expenses: Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of managing our exploratory
    operations, audit and other professional fees, and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expenses. General
    and administrative expenses also include non-cash stock-based compensation expense, investor relations related expenses, lease
    and insurance and related expenses.   

Depreciation,
    Depletion, Amortization and Accretion: The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and
    oil represents a principal component of our cost structure. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with
    our exploration, and apportion these costs to each unit of production, if any, through depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense. As we have yet to have production, the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included
    in this amortization pool.   

Going
Concern Basis   

Since
we have limited capital resources, no revenue to date and a loss from operations, our financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 
The appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital
and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period.  

Impairment
of Oil and Gas Properties   

We
follow the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration
and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized.  

All
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on
the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development
projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If
the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in income from
continuing operations before income taxes, and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production
method.  

Our
oil and gas property represents an investment in unproved properties. Oil and gas property in general is excluded from the amortized
cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed
at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve
base has not yet been established. Impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling
results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.  

Abandonment
of properties is accounted for as an adjustment to capitalized costs. The net capitalized costs are subject to a  ceiling
test  which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves
discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved
properties. The recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically
recoverable reserves, together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable
operations.  

The
total net book value of our unproved oil and gas properties under the full cost method is $6,053,000 at September 30, 2016.  

Asset
Retirement Obligation   

We
record a liability for any asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding
increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets.   

Fair
Value Considerations   

The
Company follows ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Financial Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 and related guidance. Those provisions relate to the Company s financial assets
and liabilities carried at fair value and the fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines
fair value, expands related disclosure requirements, and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of
the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, assuming the transaction
occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.  

There
are three levels of inputs to fair value measurements - Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in
active markets; Level 2, meaning the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical
or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, meaning the use of
unobservable inputs. The Company uses Level 1 inputs for its fair value measurements whenever there is an active market, with
actual quotes, market prices, and observable inputs on the measurement date. The Company uses Level 2 inputs for fair value measurements
whenever there are quoted prices for similar securities in an active market or quoted prices for identical securities in an inactive
market. The Company uses observable market data whenever available.  

Derivative
Liabilities   

In
accordance with ASC 815-40-25 and ASC 815-10-15 Derivatives and Hedging and ASC 480-10-25 Liabilities-Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity, the embedded derivatives associated with the Convertible Bonds are accounted for as liabilities during the term of
the related Convertible Bonds.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Revenue.
 We currently have no revenue generating operations.  

Operating
costs and expenses.  Operating costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,706,000 and
$7,143,000, respectively, compared to $1,984,000 and $6,454,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
in operating costs and expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same three month period in 2015
is primarily attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in other expenses.
The increase in operating costs and expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to same period in 2015 is
primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in other expenses.  

General
and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were
$1,065,000 and $5,497,000, respectively, compared to $1,579,000 and $4,441,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding
period in 2015 is primarily attributable to higher non-cash expenses recorded in connection with stock option grants during 2015.
The increase in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding
period in 2015 is primarily attributable to higher non-cash expenses recorded in connection with stock option grants during 2016
offset by higher legal and other professional fees related to the GYP arbitration and settlement during 2015.  

Other
expenses.  Other expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $641,000 and $1,646,000, respectively,
compared to $405,000 and $2,013,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Other general and administrative expenses
are comprised of non-compensation and non-professional expenses incurred. The increase in other general and administrative expenses
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015 is primarily attributable to higher
marketing expenses. The decrease in other general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the corresponding period in 2015 is primarily attributable to operational expenses incurred during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 in regard to abandonment of the Company's exploratory wells (in the former Joseph and Asher-Menashe Licenses).  

Other expense
(income), net.  Other expense  (income) , net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $18,000 and
($397,000) compared to $19,000 and $36,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in Other expense
 (income) , net during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding nine month periods in 2015
is primarily attributable to a gain on derivative liability recorded during 2016 offset by higher interest and financial expenses
recorded during 2016.  

Net
Loss.  Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,724,000 and $6,746,000 compared to $2,003,000
and $6,490,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements. As discussed above, we have historically met our
capital requirements through the issuance of our securities as well as proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt, as well
as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common equity.  

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and
development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future. Our current operations
are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s
estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially incorrect, our ability to continue as a going concern
will be impaired. Our unaudited interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the
normal course of business. We have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Therefore,
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had approximately $3,742,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2,871,000 at December 31, 2015,
which does not include any restricted funds. Our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was $3,407,000
at September 30, 2016 and $3,587,000 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 our working capital included $1,283,000 in restricted
cash as well as $1,043,000 as a derivative liability.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we provided bank guarantees to various governmental bodies (approximately $1,121,000) and others (approximately
$80,000) in respect of our planned exploratory drilling operations in the aggregate amount of approximately $1,201,000. The funds
securing these guarantees and additional amounts added to support currency fluctuations as required by the bank are held in interest-bearing
accounts and are reported on Zion s balance sheets as  restricted cash.   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating activities totaled $4,526,000. Cash provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,199,000 and is primarily attributable to proceeds received from
the DSPP and Notes offering. Net cash used in investing activities such as unproved oil and gas properties, other assets and restricted
bank deposits was $802,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

We
expect to incur additional significant expenditures to further our exploration programs. We estimate that, when we are not actively
drilling a well, our expenditures are approximately $530,000 per month excluding exploratory operational activities. However,
when we become engaged in active drilling operations, we estimate an additional minimum expenditure of approximately $2,500,000
per month. The above estimates are subject to change. Management believes that our existing cash balance, coupled with anticipated
proceeds under the DSPP and/or unit program proceeds, will be sufficient to finance our plan of operations through January 2017.
However, as of the date of this report we do not have sufficient cash resources on hand to both spud and drill to the desired
total depth (TD) the planned MJL well.     

Even
if we raise the funds needed to drill the MJL well to TD, there are factors that can nevertheless adversely impact our ability
to fund our operating needs, including (without limitation), unexpected or unforeseen cost overruns in planned non-drilling exploratory
work (e.g., drilling and environmental permit acquisition costs, etc.) in existing license areas and the costs associated with
extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work, which is typical of what we have experienced in the past, or plugging
and abandonment activities.  

Reference
is made to the discussion above under  Capital Resources Highlights  for information relating to working capital that we
raised through September 30, 2016.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not currently use any off-balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other
purpose.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

The
Company does not believe that the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements in 2016 had a significant impact on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flow, except for Update No. 2015-03 Interest Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation
of a debt discount.  

For
public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  

ITEM
    3.   
       QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Market
risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes
may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and/or equity prices.
In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes
in interest rates.  

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risks.  A portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses and certain supplier contracts, are
denominated in New Israeli Shekels ( NIS ). As a result, we have significant exposure to the risk of fluctuating exchange
rates with the U.S. Dollar ( USD ), our primary reporting currency. Since December 31, 2015 and 2014 to September
30, 2016, the USD has fluctuated by approximately (3.4%) and (3.7%) respectively against the NIS. Continuing devaluation of the
US dollar against the NIS will result in lower operating costs from NIS denominated expenses. To date, we have not hedged any
of our currency exchange rate risks, but we may do so in the future.  

Interest
Rate Risk.  Our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments. We maintain an investment portfolio of short
term bank deposits and money market funds. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged, and are, due to their
very short-term nature, subject to minimal interest rate risk. We currently do not hedge interest rate exposure. Because of the
short-term maturities of our investments, we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative
impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment. At September 30,
2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits, inclusive of restricted cash, of approximately $5,025,000. 
The weighted average annual interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2016
was approximately 0.14%.  

The
primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly
increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we invest our excess cash in short-term bank deposits and money market funds that
may invest in high quality debt instruments.  

ITEM
    4.    
       CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. As of September 30, 2016, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive
officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
