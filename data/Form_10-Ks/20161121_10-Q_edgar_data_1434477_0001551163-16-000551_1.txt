PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
     
  Item 1.  
       Condensed Financial Statements  
   
 Our financial statements included in this Form 10-Q are as follows: 

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and the SEC instructions to Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the full year. 

SUNVALLEY SOLAR, INC.  
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 
  NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Sunvalley and its subsidiary, Sunvalley Solar Energy, Inc. (formerly known as Rayco Enterprises, Inc).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December 31, 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years. 
   
  NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of the financial statements. The Company   s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company   s financial statements.

  NOTE 3     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Inventory  
   
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on an average cost basis; and the inventory is comprised of raw materials and finished goods. Raw materials consist of fittings and other components necessary to assemble the Company   s finished goods.  Finished goods consist of solar panels ready for installation and delivery to customers. 
   
 The Company   s inventory consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Loss per Common Share  
   
 Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares (restricted and free trading) during the periods presented. Basic loss per share and diluted loss per share are the same amount because the impact of additional common shares that might have been issued under the Company   s outstanding and exercisable stock options would be anti-dilutive. Dilutive instruments include 5,200,000 shares to be issued upon the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and 2,550,000 shares to be issued upon the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share. There were 7,750,000 such potentially anti-dilutive shares excluded as of September 30, 2016. 
   
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
   
 The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the Company   s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts.  The Company periodically reviews the allowance by reviewing factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions which may affect a customer   s ability to pay. 
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary.  All intercompany amounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, 
   
  Depreciation and Amortization  
   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the asset. 
   
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
   
 Goodwill is tested on an annual basis and during the period between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired.  No impairment tests were performed during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and there was no impairment recorded as of September 30, 2016 

SUNVALLEY SOLAR, INC.  
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 
  NOTE 3     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Impairment and Long-Lived Assets  
   
 Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based upon an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based upon the fair value of the asset.  Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
   
 The fair value of certain of the Company   s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accrued compensation and other current liabilities approximates the carrying amount because of their short maturities.   
   
  Concentrations of Risk  
   
 Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with banks insured by the FDIC.  Currently none of the cash held by banks exceeds the insured value. 
   
  Advertising Costs  
   
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  There were $29,774 and $-0- of advertising costs for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
  Costs in Excess of Billings on Uncompleted Contracts  
   
 Costs in excess of billings represent unbilled amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts. These amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of milestones or completion of the project. Generally, such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months. Based on our historical experience, we generally consider the collection risk related to these amounts to be low. When events or conditions indicate that the amounts outstanding may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded. 
   
 The Company is currently involved in certain major short-term solar panel installation projects.  The Company is accounting for revenue and expenses associated with these contracts under the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605.  Under ASC 605, income is recognized when the contracts are completed or substantially completed and billings and others costs are accumulated on the balance sheet.  Under the completed contract method, no profit or income is recorded before substantial completion of the work. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has capitalized $175,022 and $58,235 of costs incurred in relation to installation projects.   
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.  No tax expense or benefit was recorded for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016.

  NOTE 7     BUSINESS COMBINATION  
   
 On May 15, 2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with to purchase 100 percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of Rayco Energy, Inc. (   Rayco   ), a San Francisco Bay Area-based energy service company focused on energy efficiency, solar power, and building modernization, in exchange for 75,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company agrees to pay an additional $350,000 in cash to shareholders of Rayco, conditioned upon the 2016 net profit from the operation of Rayco being in excess of $10,000 (   the Condition   ).  To evidence the contingent unpaid balance of the purchase price, the Company executed 6 percent subordinated promissory notes with Rayco   s shareholders in the aggregate amount $350,000, payable only upon Rayco   s 2016 net operating profit being in excess of $10,000 with interest and principal payable monthly on first day of each month commencing May 1, 2017. In the event that the Condition is not met, such notes will be deemed null and void.  The Company has recorded the $350,000 as a contingent liability. 
   
 The results of operations related to this acquisition have been included in our financial statement since the acquisition date. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, our net sales of the products acquired from Rayco Energy, Inc, were approximately $483,516 and $711,085, respectively.   
   
 In addition to consolidating the financial statements of the Company and subsidiary, certain intangible assets were identified and recognized, based upon the excess of purchase price to the net assets of the acquired subsidiary. The accounting for the business combination is based on provisional amounts and the allocation of the excess purchase price is not final, the amounts allocated to intangibles assets and goodwill, are subject to change pending the completion of final valuations of certain assets and liabilities. 

NOTE 7     BUSINESS COMBINATION (CONTINUED)  
   
 The total provisional purchase price for the business combination was allocated as follows: 

The company added a wholly-owned subsidiary named Sunvalley Solar Service, Inc. during 2016 which business is mainly for solar system maintenance and services.  No business activities were incurred for this company as of September 30, 2016.   
   
  NOTE 8     PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  Forward-Looking Statements  
     
 Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are    forward-looking statements.    These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words    believes,       project,       expects,       anticipates,       estimates,       intends,       strategy,       plan,       may,       will,       would,       will be,       will continue,       will likely result,    and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse affect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  
     
  Company Overview and Plan of Operation  
   
 Sunvalley Solar, Inc. (the    Company          we   ,    our   ) is a California-based solar power technology and system integration company founded in January of 2007. We are focused on developing our expertise and proprietary technology to install residential, commercial and governmental solar power systems. We offer turnkey solar system solutions for owners, builders and architecture firms that include designing, building, operating, monitoring and maintaining solar power systems. Our customers range from small private residences to large commercial solar power users. We have the necessary licenses and expertise to design and install large scale solar power systems. We hold a C-46 Solar License from CBCL (California Board of Contractor License). Some of the large scale commercial solar power systems that we have designed and installed include large office buildings, farming and manufacturing facilities and warehouses. Our proprietary technologies in solar installation provide our customers with a high quality, low cost and flexible solar power system solutions.  
 We are working to develop as an end-to-end solar energy solution provider by providing system solution, post-sale service, customer technical support, solar system design and field installation.  We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunvalley Solar Tech, Inc.  On May 15, 2016 we acquired Rayco Energy, Inc. (   Rayco   ), a northern California company specializing in providing cost-saving and efficient energy solutions, including LED lighting, Solar Thermal and Solar Electricity, to local communities and business units. We also agreed to invest no less than $350,000 working capital into Rayco for its current projects and working capital.  
  Business Development Plan  
   
 The primary components of our growth strategy are as follows: 

Developing and commercializing our proprietary solar technologies including our coating and focusing technologies, networked PV panel system. By deploying these new technologies into our PV panels and solar installation business, we hope to enhance the value provided to our customers and increase our profitability. 

Promoting and enhancing our company   s brand and reputation in solar design and integration and expanding our installation business. 

Developing a PV panel manufacturing capability to provide high efficiency and low cost solar panels to US market. This will complement our installation business and provide an implementation platform for our R D. 
   
   Expansion of Installation Business   
   
 We are planning to expand our installation business. We will continue to execute our marketing and sales strategy in Southern California and, with additional capital, will be able to expand our business to cover Northern California, Arizona or other states. The planned expansion is expected to occur through acquiring smaller installation companies in these regions and/or through the establishment of subsidiaries in these states and boost our installation profits. Our current intention is to establish two new offices located in Northern California or other states and in San Diego. The estimated start-up cost for each new branch would be approximately $500,000.  
   
 If we are able to expand our installation business, it will assist us in gaining favorable terms from OEM international manufacturers of our planned solar panel manufacturing operation. In addition, an expanded installation business would allow us to accelerate the introduction of our new technologies and solar parts and would generate additional revenue to fund initial investment in our planned Distributed Power Plant business and to further fund our investments in R D.  
   
   Commercialization of Research and Development   
   
 Our Patent    Networked Solar Panels and Related Methods    was issued on February 24, 2015.  We will need to commercialize this advanced technology through the design, fabrication, and characterization of prototype solar components and system cell.  Through this technology, it is able to address the undesirable fluctuations in the voltage of the power grid due to uncertain environmental impact to solar system. Commercializing this technology into mass production will involve cooperation and approval from utility companies. In addition, the networked PV panel concept will also need to demonstrate that panels using the technology will have a productive life-span and a tolerance to environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind load that are sufficient for the panels to be used in real life application. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that we will be able to commercially produce and market solar panels using our new networked PV panel system technology. 
   
 Prior to initiating our planned OEM manufacturing of Sunvalley-branded solar panels, we will need to commercialize our advanced panel technology through the design, fabrication, and characterization of a prototype solar cell. The total expense for planned commercialization of our research and development will be approximately $500,000.  
   
   Initiate OEM Manufacturing of Solar Panels    
   
 By leveraging our solar panel installation business and R D, we plan to procure OEM solar panels from selected Chinese manufacturers and to market them in the U.S. under our brand name. We will be responsible for R D, quality control, customer service, sales and marketing activities, as well as panel certification in U.S.  
   
 The estimated OEM panel cost is less than $0.50 per watt. As a reference, currently, the lowest panel price is around $0.70 per watt (Mono-crystalline, Polycrystalline). We can use our own sales and installation platform to showcase the new panels and drive sales of the new panels in the U.S market. Meanwhile, we will continue our R D effort on panel coating and other advanced technologies and apply  

the results to its panel manufacturing business. The goal will be to further improve the efficiency, lower the cost of solar panels with our proprietary technologies, and to grow our market share.  
   
 Our marketing strategy for its planned OEM solar panels is as follows: 

Set-up a platform to showcase our innovative solar panel technologies and make Sunvalley solar panels a household name.   
   
 Unlike other merchandise, solar panel is very unique in that it requires very high level of quality assurance and customer satisfaction. Providing satisfactory customer service and technical support is absolutely vital in solar panel sales. As the first step, we will strive to make its brand a household name. The Sunvalley solar panel will be used by our installation business as well as several other installation companies which have partnerships with us. We do not currently have partnerships with other solar installation companies, but we plan to pursue them after introducing the panels to the market through our own installation business. A marketing campaign aimed at other solar installation companies will help to achieve this goal. We will use our own installation business as the platform to showcase the product quality and build up consumer awareness of its brand. 

Penetrate into the main stream distribution network   
   
 By leveraging early successes and customer trust earned from our initial installations, we plan to penetrate into the mainstream distribution network with our OEM solar panels. 

Further sale activities   
   
 Once our brand name solar panels become well known, our sales team will begin an aggressive marketing campaign to connect the individual sales points (distributors and venders) to form a distribution network. The marketing campaigns will also include attending trade shows, advertising in the media (TV commercials and newspaper advertisement) and designating local representatives to boost the market share and brand awareness. 

Offer a low cost, high efficiency solar panel derived from advanced research   
   
 To boost our solar panel market share, our R D team will work with our OEM partner to apply selective coating technique and other cutting edge technologies to further reduce the manufacturing cost and improve the panel efficiency.  
   
 The total capital required to initiate our planned panel manufacturing business would be approximately $2,000,000 which can be categorized into three parts: 

Registration and Certification of OEM panels with our brand     $300,000, including UL certification fees, CEC registration fees, and lab testing fees. 

Initial Inventory     $1,500,000. We will need to keep 4-5 containers of PV panels in the warehouse in order to support sales of 5~10M watts per year, which means we will need to have over $1,000,000 in inventory for PV panels only. An additional $300,000 in inventory would be needed in order to keep the requisite amount of inverters and racking and panel cleaning systems. In addition, we anticipate providing variable payment terms to different customers based on their creditworthiness; this will add additional cash flow pressure. 

OEM Management costs     $200,000  
   
 We are among the few companies in California that has the permit and expertise to install large-scale commercial and/or government solar power systems, together with roof constructional design and building interior/exterior electrical designs. We believe additional advantages are provided by our experience in filing solar power system permit applications and rebate applications and our expertise gained through our experience with governments and utility companies.  
   
  Expected Changes In Number of Employees, Plant, and Equipment  
   
 We do not currently plan to purchase specific additional physical plant and significant equipment within the immediate future. We do not currently have specific plans to change the number of our employees during the next twelve months. 
   
  Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
     
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of $2,956,670 and incurred costs of sales of $2,310,302, resulting in gross profit of $646,368. We incurred general and administrative expenses of $211,554, salary and wage expense of $433,706, and professional fees of $37,923. We recorded other income of $887 and interest expense of $2,714. Our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $38,642. 
   
 By comparison, during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we generated revenues of $817,481 and incurred costs of sales of $557,767, resulting in gross profit of $259,714. We incurred general and administrative expenses of $74,970, salary and wage expense of $560,806, and professional fees of $53,374. We recorded other income of $346 and interest expense of $549. Our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $429,639. 
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of $3,267,217 and incurred costs of sales of $2,443,564, resulting in gross profit of $823,653. We incurred general and administrative expenses of $460,735, salary and wage expense of $1,865,293, and professional fees of $122,751.

Our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $702,251. 
   
 We are currently working on three major installation projects with contract prices totaling approximately 
$4.4 million and these contracts are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2016. 
   
 Our results of operations presented in this Quarterly Report include the results of our newly-acquired subsidiary, Rayco Energy, Inc., from the May 15, 2016 date of acquisition. We believe that, as a result of our acquisition of Rayco Energy, our total revenues will increase as compared to prior financial periods. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, our net sales of the products acquired from Rayco Energy, Inc., were approximately $483,516 and $711,085, respectively.   
   
 Our significant increase in salaries and wages expense as compared to the same periods last year is the result of our issuance of 2,000,000 shares of Class B Convertible Preferred Stock to certain officers, directors, and employees on July 23, 2015, which is being recognized over the vesting period of the  

grants. Compensation expense of $120,549 and $1,117,809 was recorded during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
     
 As of September 30, 2016, we had current assets in the amount of $3,497,512, consisting of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $808,457, accounts receivable of $2,204,275, inventory in the amount of $202,923, costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $175,022, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $69,335, and restricted cash of $37,500. As of September 30, 2016, we had current liabilities in the amount of $5,389,284. These consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $4,128,292, customer deposits of $668,270, a contingent liability of $350,000, accrued warranty of $139,333, and advances from contractors of $103,389. Our working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016 was therefore $1,891,772. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating activities used a net $400,120 in cash.  Investing activities used $11,994 in cash and financing activities provided $11,373 during the period.  
 Our accounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2016 consisted of the following: 
 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had no long term liabilities. As part of our acquisition of Rayco Energy, we acquired a short-term note with a balance $121,201 as of September 30, 2016. The note accrues interest at a rate of 24.90%. This note has been included in the credit card payable figure as shown above. 
 In connection with our acquisition of Rayco Energy, we agreed to pay $350,000 in cash as a part of the purchase price.  We issued a Note Payable for this obligation in the amount of $350,000, bearing interest at 6%.  The Note is contingent upon the operations of Rayco netting a profit in excess of $10,000 for the period May 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016.  If the condition is met, principal and interest are payable on the Note monthly on the first day of each month commencing May 1, 2017 consistent with a six-month amortization schedule.  If the contingency is not met, the note will be voided.  We may make prepayments under the Note. 
 In order to move forward with our business development plan set forth above, we will require additional financing in the approximate amount of $4,500,000, to be allocated as follows:  
  Initiate OEM Manufacturing  
 $ 2,000,000 
  R D Commercialization Costs 
 $    500,000 
 Expansion of Installation Business  
  (3 new branches)  
 $ 1,500,000 
 Additional working capital and  
  general corporate  
  $    500,000  
  Total capital needs  
 $ 4,500,000 
   
 We will require substantial additional financing in the approximate amount of $4,500,000 in order to execute our business expansion and development plans and we may require additional financing in order to sustain substantial future business operations for an extended period of time. We currently do not have any firm arrangements for financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required, in the amounts necessary to execute on our plans in full, or on terms which are economically feasible. 
 We are currently seeking additional financing. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to reduce the planned future growth of our operations.  
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
 As of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  
   
  Going Concern  
     
 We have experienced recurring net losses and had an accumulated deficit of $5,079,246 as of September 30, 2016. To date, we have not been able to produce sufficient sales to become cash flow positive and profitable on a consistent basis. The success of our business plan during the next 12 months and beyond will be contingent upon generating sufficient revenue to cover our costs of operations and/or upon obtaining additional financing. For these reasons, our auditor has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most    critical accounting polices    in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a    critical accounting policy    is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company   s financial condition and results, and requires management   s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We do not believe that any accounting policies currently fit this definition. 
     
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 Our management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. Our management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements. 
     
  Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
   
 A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
     
  Item 4.     Controls and Procedures   
  
We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Zhijian (James) Zhang and our Chief Financial Officer, Mandy Chung. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30,  

2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Management determined that the material weaknesses that resulted in controls being ineffective are primarily due to lack of resources and number of employees. Material weaknesses exist in the segregation of duties required for effective controls and various reconciliation and control procedures not regularly performed due to the lack of staff and resources. 
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls  
   
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error.   Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
