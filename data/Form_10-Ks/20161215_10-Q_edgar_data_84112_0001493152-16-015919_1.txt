1 Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. It is
suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Company s April 30, 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Operating results for any
quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year.  

Note
2 Investments  

The
Company has investments in publicly traded equity securities, corporate bonds, state and municipal debt securities, real estate
investment trusts, and money markets funds. The investments in securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, and
are reported at fair value. Available-for-sale investments in debt securities mature between November 2016 and November
2048. The Company uses the average cost method to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported separately as a
component of stockholders  equity. Dividend and interest income are reported as earned.  

As
of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, investments consisted of the following:  

The
Company evaluates all marketable securities for other-than temporary declines in fair value, which are defined as when the cost
basis exceeds the fair value for approximately one year. The Company also evaluates the nature of the investment, cause of impairment
and number of investments that are in an unrealized position. When an  other-than-temporary  decline is identified,
the Company will decrease the cost of the marketable security to the new fair value and recognize a real loss. The investments
are periodically evaluated to determine if impairment changes are required. As a result of this standard, management did not
record an impairment loss during the quarter, but did record a loss of $13,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016. Likewise,
as for the corresponding periods last year, management did not record a loss for the quarter, but did record a $23,000 impairment
loss for the six months ended October 31, 2015.  

The
following table shows the investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be  other-than-temporarily impaired ,
aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position,
at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, respectively.  

Unrealized
Loss Breakdown by Investment Type at October 31, 2016  

Unrealized
Loss Breakdown by Investment Type at April 30, 2016  

Municipal
Bonds   

The
unrealized losses on the Company s investments in municipal bonds were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual
terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment.
Because the Company has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company
does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at October 31, 2016.  

Corporate
Bonds   

The
Company s unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to two bonds. The contractual term of these investments
does not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because the Company
has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider
these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at October 31, 2016.  

Marketable
Equity Securities and REITs   

The
Company s investments in marketable equity securities and REITs consist of a wide variety of companies. Investments in these
companies include growth, growth income, and foreign investment objectives. The individual holdings have been evaluated, and due
to management s plan to hold on to these investments for an extended period, the Company does not consider these investments
to be other-than-temporarily impaired at October 31, 2016.

6 Retirement Benefit Plan  

On
January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the George Risk Industries, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the  Plan ). The Plan
is a defined contribution savings plan designed to provide retirement income to eligible employees of the corporation. The Plan
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Matching contributions by
the Company of approximately $3,000 were paid during both the quarters ending October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Likewise,
the Company paid matching contributions of approximately $5,000 during both the six-month periods ending October 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  

Note
7 Fair Value Measurements  

Generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) defines fair value as the price that would be received
from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit
risk.  

US
GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The levels of the fair value hierarchy under US GAAP are
described below:  

Level
    1  
      Valuation
    is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.   

Level
    2  
      Valuation
    is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments
    in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable
    in the market.   

Level
    3  
      Valuation
    is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable
    assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.   

Investments
and Marketable Securities    

As
of October 31, 2016, our investments consisted of money markets, publicly traded equity securities, real estate investment trusts
(REITs) as well as certain state and municipal debt securities and corporate bonds. Our marketable securities are valued using
third-party broker statements. The value of the investments is derived from quoted market information. The inputs to the valuation
are generally classified as Level 1 given the active market for these securities, however, if an active market does not exist,
which is the case for municipal bonds and REITs, the inputs are recorded as Level 2.  

Fair
Value Hierarchy    

The
following table sets forth our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and a non-recurring basis by
level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by US GAAP, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of

forward-looking statements. The information included herein represents our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing.
Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes
available in the future.    

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached condensed financial statements, and with the Company s
audited financial statements and discussion for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.   

Executive
Summary   

The
Company s performance has remained fairly constant through the first and second quarters, due to the continuation of our
quality USA made products with the ability for customization and our notable customer service. Additionally, strong performance
in the stock market has generated adequate returns on the marketable securities. Challenges in the coming months include the implementation
of new hardware and software systems which will enhance productivity and communication throughout the organization and getting
new products out to the marketplace.  

Results
of Operations   

Net
    sales were $2,883,000 for the quarter ended October 31, 2016, which is a 3.89% increase from the corresponding quarter last
    year. Year-to-date net sales were $5,549,000 at October 31, 2016, which is a 1.44% decrease from the same period last year.
    The slight variations in sales shows the stability of the Company and loyalty of its customer base. Our ongoing commitment
    to outstanding customer service and customization of products are a few of the many reasons sales remained relatively constant.
    New competition and the inability to bring new products to market in a timelier manner are a few of the reasons why management
    believes it has not been able to increase sales in a timelier manner.   

Cost
    of goods sold was 44.54% of net sales for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 and was 42.77% for the same quarter last year.
    Year-to-date cost of goods sold percentages were 48.12% for the current six months and 45.26% for the corresponding six months
    last year, keeping within the target of less than 50% for both the quarter and year-to-date results. The biggest reason for
    the slight increases in the current periods is the fact that there were minimum wage increases in our state which increased
    the cost of our direct labor.   

Operating
    expenses were up $18,000 for the quarter and $20,000 for the six-months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding
    periods last year. These increased costs are primarily due to new product development and implementation costs and fees for
    the new computer software. The Company has been able to keep the operating expenses at less than 30% of net sales for many
    years; however, the effects of the Affordable Care Act, the State of Nebraska regulatory increase in the minimum wage and
    various other expenditures continue to provide concerns regarding the ability to maintain this pattern.   

Income
    from operations for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 was at $854,000 which is a 0.81% decrease from the corresponding quarter
    last year, which had income from operations of $861,000. Income from operations for the six months ended October 31, 2016
    was at $1,416,000, which is a 13.61% decrease from the corresponding six months last year, which had income from operations
    of $1,639,000.   

Other
    income and expenses are up when comparing to the current quarter and six-month periods the prior year, with an increase of
    $159,000 in the current quarter and an increase of $142,00 for the current year-to-date. The majority of activity in these
    accounts consists of investment interest, dividends, and gain or loss on sale of investments. With the recent uptick in the
    performance of the stock market, decisions were made to sell holdings and take the realized gain and dividends and interest
    payments remain solid.   

Overall,
    net income for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 was up $119,000, or 20.77%, from the same quarter last year. Conversely,
    net income for the six-month period ended October 31, 2016 was down $36,000, or 2.78%, from the same period in the prior year.   

Earnings
    per common share for quarter ended October 31, 2016 were $0.14 per share and $0.25 per share for the year-to-date numbers.
    EPS for the quarter and six months ended October 31, 2015 were $0.11 per share and $0.26 per share, respectively.   

Liquidity
and capital resources   

Operating   

Net
    cash decreased $326,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to a decrease of $972,000 during the corresponding
    period last year.   

Accounts
    receivable decreased $53,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared with a $254,000 increase for the same period
    last year. The smaller current year decrease is a result of sales remaining steady and the Company s ongoing ability
    to continue to collect on accounts receivable in a timely manner.   

Inventories
    decreased $286,000 during the current six-month period as compared to a $563,000 increase last year, primarily due to the
    fact that sales have remained steady, which drives the amount that needs to be purchased. This is offset by price increases
    from various vendors.   

Prepaid
    expenses saw a $12,000 decrease for the current six months, primarily due to the recording of regular monthly expense transactions
    (from the purchasing of service agreements and such in advance at intervals of a year and sometimes more) and not having to
    renew any service agreements over the last six months. The prior six months showed a $37,000 decrease in prepaid expenses.

There
    was a slight increase of $2,000 income tax overpayment for the period ended October 31, 2016, while the increase was $228,000
    for the same period the prior year. Management usually pays income tax estimates in the same amounts that were actually taxed
    on for the prior year when we don t expect a huge fluctuation in income and since net income up to this point is close
    to the same as last year, the estimates are a close match to the actual expense.   

Accounts
    payable shows increases for both six month periods at $97,000 and $24,000, respectively. The company strives to pay all invoices
    within terms, and the variance in increases is primarily due to the timing of receipt of products and payment of invoices.   

Accrued
    expenses decreased $16,000 for the current six-month period as compared to a $3,000 increase for the six-month period ended
    October 31, 2015.   

Investing   

As
    for our investment activities, the Company spent approximately $120,000 on acquisitions of property and equipment for the
    current six-month period, in comparison to the corresponding six months last year, where there was activity of $27,000. In
    addition, the company has disbursed $50,000 towards assets manufactured on site for the current six-month period.   

Additionally,
    the Company continues to purchase marketable securities, which include municipal bonds and quality stocks. During the six-month
    period ended October 31, 2016 there was quite a bit of buy/sell activity in the investment accounts. Net cash spent on purchases
    of marketable securities for the six-month period ended October 31, 2016 was $373,000 compared to $376,000 spent in the prior
    six-month period. We continue to use  money manager  accounts for most stock transactions. By doing this, the
    Company gives an independent third party firm, who are experts in this field, permission to buy and sell stocks at will. The
    Company pays a quarterly service fee based on the value of the investments.    

Financing   

The
    Company continues to purchase back common stock when the opportunity arises. For the six-month period ended October 31, 2016,
    the Company purchased $1,000 worth of treasury stock, in comparison to $4,000 repurchased in the corresponding six-month period
    last year.   

The
    company paid out dividends of $1,596,000 during the six months ending October 31, 2016. These dividends were paid during the
    second quarter. The company declared a dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock on September 30, 2016 and these dividends
    were paid by October 31, 2016. As for the prior year numbers, dividends paid was $1,553,000 for the six months ending October
    31, 2015. A dividend of $0.34 per common share was declared and paid during the second fiscal quarter last year.   

The
    following is a list of ratios to help analyze George Risk Industries  performance:   

New
Product Development   

The
Company and its engineering department continue to develop enhancements to product lines, develop new products which complement
existing products, and look for products that are well suited to our distribution network and manufacturing capabilities. Items
currently in the development process include:  

Wireless
    contact switches, Wi-Fi to enable monitoring of sensors from a smartphone, pool alarms and environmental sensors are in development

A
    redesign of our top selling resistor pack. The new design will be more automated which will allow us to produce more in a
    shorter timeframe.   

Redesign
    of the connectors in our raceway line has gone through molding and are going through product safety standards testing approval.
    The original raceway line connectors were not fire rated and high voltage rated compliant.   

Slim-line
    face plate for pool alarms that will also allow homeowner to change the plate to match their decor   

Triple
    biased High Security Switch    

Redesign
    of our Current Controller is complete and now is going through the U.L. approval process. The new design will allow us to
    manufacture a 15-amp version that would automatically turn on a whole room of lights and a 220-volt version for international
    markets. 12 and 24-volt versions are also being developed in response to many requests to turn on LED lighting.   

Redesign
    for the cover of the 29-Series terminal switch   

New
    float water sensor that will monitor water levels in livestock tanks and sump pumps   

Fuel
    level monitor   With fuel theft being a major problem around the world, we are crafting a monitor to tie into the security
    system to alarm if tanks or trucks are tampered with.   

A
    new version of our 200-36 overhead door switch line up is nearing completion. The modified version, part #200-36UF, is for
    universal fit that allows an installer to replace an existing competitor s switch without drilling new holes into the
    cement or adjusting the location. The modified case has an additional mounting hole along with reshaped mounting holes.   

The
    smaller size custom power transfer device (PTDC) has been completed. The PTDC series offer a secure way to channel electrical
    wiring from the door frame to the door and are used for powering exit bars, locks, electric strikes etc. We will offer two
    different end pieces; 0.218  inside diameter and 0.313  inside diameter which will allow different sizes or wire
    to be looped through the custom length armored cable.   

Other
Information   

In
addition to researching developing new products, management is always open to the possibility of acquiring a business or product
line that would complement our existing operations. Due to the Company s strong cash position, management believes this
could be achieved without the need for outside financing. The intent is to utilize the equipment, marketing techniques and established
customers to deliver new products and increase sales and profits.  

There
are no known seasonal trends with any of GRI s products, since we sell to distributors and OEM manufacturers. Our products
are tied to the housing industry and will fluctuate with building trends.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The objective of this
update is to provide a robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and, upon its effective date, replaces almost
all existing revenue recognition guidance. This update is effective in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017
and the interim periods within that year. The Company is evaluating the impact of this update on the Company s financial
statements.  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-04,  Requirement that All Deferred Income Tax Assets
and Liabilities Be Presented as Non-Current in a Classified Balance Sheet . The objective of this update is to require deferred
tax liabilities and assets be classified entirely as non-current in a classified balance sheet. This update is effective in annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and the interim periods within that year. The Company is evaluating the impact
of this update on the Company s financial statements.  

In
February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize so-called
right-of-use assets and liabilities for most leases having lease terms of 12 months or more. This update is effective in annual
reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2019 and the interim periods starting thereafter. The Company is evaluating the
impact of this update on the Company s financial statements.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures  

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (also working as our chief financial
officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of October 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer
(also working as our chief financial officer) concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures employed at the Company were
not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms.  

We
continue to operate with a limited number of accounting and financial personnel. Although we added the services of a controller
during 2014, more training will be required to fulfill disclosure control and procedure responsibilities, including review procedures
for key accounting schedules and timely and proper documentation of material transactions and agreements. We believe these control
deficiencies represent material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

Despite
the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our consolidated financial statements included in
this report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in
all material respects.  

We
are committed to the establishment of effective internal controls over financial reporting and will place emphasis on quarterly
and year-end closing procedures, timely documentation and internal review of accounting and financial reporting consequences of
material contracts and agreements, and enhanced review of all schedules and account analyses by experienced accounting department
personnel or independent consultants.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2016 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
