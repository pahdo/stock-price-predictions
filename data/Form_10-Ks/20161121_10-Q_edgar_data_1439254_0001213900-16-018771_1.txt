Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.   

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects, 
 plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential, 
 proposed,   intended,  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating
results or our future financial condition or state other  forward-looking  information. There may be events in the future
that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence
of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial
condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could
lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no
duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual
results.

1 - ORGANIZATION   

Ceetop Inc. (the  Company  or
 Ceetop ) was incorporated in Oregon on February 18, 2003 under the name of GL Gold Inc.  On June 6, 2003,
the Company filed an amendment with the State of Oregon changing its name to Oregon Gold, Inc.  On January 7, 2011,
Oregon Gold Inc. changed its name to China Ceetop.com, Inc.  On September 12, 2013, the Company changed its name to
Ceetop Inc. 

Surry
Holdings Limited ( Surry ) was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on September 18, 2009.  Surry
holds 100% of Westow Technology Limited ( Westow ), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which in
turn holds 100% of Shenzhen Ceetop Network Technology Co., Limited ( SZ Ceetop ), a company incorporated in Shenzhen,
Peoples  Republic of China ( PRC ) and ultimately holds 100% of Hangzhou Ceetop Network Technology Co., Limited
( HZ Ceetop ), a company incorporated in Hangzhou, PRC.  

Pursuant
to a series of transactions completed in September 2009, Surry became the holding company of Westow, SZ Ceetop and HZ Ceetop ( Group
Reorganization ).   

Since Surry, Westow, SZ Ceetop and HZ Ceetop
were under common control of a controlling party both before and after the completion of the Group Reorganization, the Group Reorganization
was accounted for using merger accounting.  The consolidated financial statements  CFS  were prepared on
the basis as if Surry had always been the holding company of Westow, SZ Ceetop and HZ Ceetop. 

The Company operates in a single reportable
segment, and the Company providing an online platform for distribution of 3C products (computers/communications/consumer electronics)
in the PRC by way of a website named  www.ceetop.com . 

The Company has transformed from online
retail sales into an integrated supply chain service provider, and focuses on business-to-business supply chain management
and related value added services for customers.   

On March 5, 2013, the name of its subsidiary,
Shenzhen Ceetop Network Technology Co., Limited ( SZ Ceetop ) was changed to Guizhou Ceetop Network Technology Co.,
Limited ( GZ Ceetop ). 

On May 29, 2013, GZ Ceetop established
two 100% owned subsidiaries, Hangzhou Tuoyin Management Consulting Co., Limited and Hangzhou Lianzhan Supply Chain Management Co.,
Limited to enhance the management of Business to Business supply chain service. 

On August 22, 2013, GZ Ceetop acquired
a 42.5% interest in Hangzhou Softview Information Technology Company Limited to enhance information technology in the supply chain
management system. 

On January
14, 2014, GZ Ceetop changed its name to Guizhou Ceetop Group Holding Co., Limited. 

On April 3,
2014, Surry changed its name to Ceetop Holdings Limited. 

On July 24,
2014, the Company established a wholly owned company Ceetop (Hong Kong) Limited in Hong Kong as a subsidiary of Ceetop Holdings
Limited for its business expansion. 

On
June 30, 2016, the Company discontinued operations, and terminated the registration, of its subsidiary Hangzhou Ceetop Network
Technology LLC   .  

These CFS present the Company and its
subsidiaries on a historical basis. 

Note
2 - GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying unaudited CFS were prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  As shown in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company incurred net losses of $71,680 and $147,187, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively;
$252,575 and $435,215 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has accumulated deficit of $10,874,016
and $10,621,441 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  These factors create an uncertainty about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  In this regard, management may attempt to raise any necessary
additional funds not provided by operations through loans or through additional sales of common stock.  There is no
guarantee the Company will be able to successfully raise funds or if it does those funds will be available at terms favorable
to the Company. 

Note
3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation  

The accompanying CFS were prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).   The Company's
functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi; however, the accompanying CFS were translated and presented in the United States
Dollars ( USD ). 

Basis
of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation  

The CFS include the financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries  
  including Ceetop Inc., Ceetop
Holdings Ltd., Westow Technology Limited, Guizhou Ceetop Network Technology Co Ltd., and Ceetop (Hong Kong) Ltd. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  

Investments
in business entities, in which the Company does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method.  On August 22, 2013, the Company acquired a 42.5% interest
in Hangzhou Softview Information Technology Company Limited (Softview), which was disposed on May 14, 2016. During the holding
period, Softview was accounted for using equity method. See Note 7 for details.  

Unaudited Interim Financial Information 

These
unaudited interim CFS were prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2015.   2016.  

The consolidated balance sheets and
certain comparative information as of December 31, 2015 are derived from the audited CFS and related notes for the year ended December
31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual Financial Statements ), included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These
unaudited interim CFS should be read in conjunction with the 2015 Annual Financial Statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  

In November 2015, the FASB ( Board )
issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires that all deferred
tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This
update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The
Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its CFS. 

In February 2016, the Board issued ASU
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Topic 840, Leases
(FAS 13). ASU No. 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating
leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have
on its CFS. 

In March 2016, the Board issued an ASU
amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a component
of income tax expense rather than equity. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating
activity on the statement of cash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected
forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, we expect the ASU will have a
material impact on our CFS. 

As of September 30, 2016, there are
no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have a material effect on the CFS. 

Note
4 - OTHER RECEIVABLES   

Other
receivables contains the following:  

The Company loaned three million
RMB (the  Loan ) to an individual that was secured by 3,000,000 shares of common stock (the  Shares )
of the Company (the  Collateral ). In June 2016, the Loan was cancelled in exchange for the holders agreeing to cancel
and terminate the Shares. As a result of the above cancellations, the balance of other accounts receivable decreased by $452,025
(3,000,000,000 RMB) and the equity accounts decreased by the same amount. Specifically, Common Stock decreased by $3,000 and Additional
Paid-In Capital decreased by $449,025. Because this transaction was a transaction dealing with equity, no gain was recognized,
the excess of the fair value of the shares over the book value of the receivable was reflected in additional paid in capital. 

The
receivable from former investee is due on or before May 30, 2017.  

Other receivables are such items as rent deposit,
prepayment for social benefits. 

Note
5 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT   

Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are changed incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When
property, plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is
provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives of: 

Office equipment    
       3 - 5 years  
 
     Leasehold improvement    
       3 years  
 
     Motor vehicles    
       10 years  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, property, plant   equipment consist of the following:  

Depreciation for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,919 and $6,635, respectively; for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $22,154 and $22,500,
respectively. 

Note
6   INTANGIBLE ASSET   

In
December 2013, the Company entered into a software development agreement with a software developer in the PRC to develop custom
software for the Company s exclusive use for $981,643 (RMB 6,000,000).  Pursuant to the terms of the software
development agreement, the Company prepaid $981,643 upon signing the software development agreement.   

As
of December 31, 2015, the software development was completed and the prepayment ($981,643) was reported as an intangible asset.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the value of intangible assets was $869,177 and $920,680, respectively. The amortization
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $27,244.  

Note
7   EQUITY INVESTMENT    

In accordance with ASC 323, accounting for
equity method investments, investee companies that are not consolidated, but over which the Company exercises significant influence,
are accounted for under the equity method. Whether or not the Company exercises significant influence with respect to an investee
company depends on an evaluation of several factors including, among others, representation on the investee company s board
of directors and ownership level, which is generally a 20% to 50% interest in the voting securities of the investee company. Under
the equity method of accounting, an investee company s accounts are not reflected within the CFS. However, the Company s
share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption  Equity (loss)/gain-share of investee
company  in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company s carrying value in an investee
company under equity method is reflected in the caption   Equity interest in an Investee company   in
the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

When
the Company s carrying value in an equity method investee company is reduced to zero, no further losses are recorded in
the Company s consolidated financial statements unless the Company has guaranteed the obligations of the investee company
or has committed additional funding to finance the investee company. When the investee company subsequently reports income, the
Company will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized.  

With
respect to the difference between investor cost and underlying equity in net assets of investee at date of investment (basis difference),
ASC 323 requires this difference to be assigned to depreciable or amortizable assets or liabilities and the basis difference should
be amortized or depreciated in connection with the income/loss recognized by the investor of their proportionate share of the
investee s net income or loss.  This effectively adjusts the investee basis to the investor s basis, generally
over a period of time.  

On
May 14, 2016 GZ Ceetop entered into an agreement whereby it sold its equity interest in Softview, with an original value of $1,280,738
(8,500,000 RMB), to Softview for $1,130,063 (7,500,000 RMB, the  Purchase Price ). The Purchase Price was payable
as follows: offsetting by Softview of $979,388 (6,500,000 RMB) owed to it by GZ Ceetop, $75,338 (500,000 RMB) payable before March
1, 2017, and $75,338 (500,000 RMB) payable before May 1, 2017, respectively.  

As
a result of the disposition of the equity investment, the Company recorded a gain of $31,936.  

As
of the date of disposition and December 31, 2015, the Company s share of underlying net assets of Softview is as follow:  

The results of operations of Softview are
summarized below: 

Condensed
income statement information:

(May 14, 2016    ),
the Company incurred a loss of $9,491, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a loss of $62,683.  

Note
8 - ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER PAYABLES   

Accrued
expenses and other payables contain the following:  

The
loans from third party individuals do not have terms and conditions in writing and bear no interest. The loans are due on demand.  

Note
9 - INCOME TAXES   

The
Company operates in more than one jurisdiction with the main operations conducted in PRC, and no activities in United States,
with complex regulatory environments subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing
authorities.  The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities, if required.  

Pursuant
to the PRC Income Tax Laws, the Enterprise Income Tax ( EIT ) through December 31, 2007 is at a statutory rate of
33%, which is comprised of 30% national income tax and 3% local income tax.  From January 1, 2008 onwards, the EIT is
at a statutory rate of 25%.  

The
Company has not recognized deferred tax asset in respect of tax loss in these Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not more-likely-than-not
that the future taxable profit against which loss can be utilized will be available to the entities operating in PRC.  

The
deferred tax asset not recognized is as follows:   

The
following table reconciles the statutory rates to the Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September

Interest
associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax and penalties in selling, general and administrative expenses
in the statements of operations.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no related
interest and penalties expenses. Currently, the Company is not subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions, but the tax
authority in PRC has the right to examine the Company s tax position in all past years.  

Note
10   SHARE CAPITAL   

The Company is authorized to issue up to 100,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 3,558,046 shares of Series A preferred stock of par value of $0.001 per
share.  As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, the Company has/had 44,596,631 and 47,596,631 shares
of common stock, respectively, and no shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.  

The Company loaned three million RMB (the
 Loan ) to an individual that was secured by 3,000,000 shares of common stock (the  Shares ) of the Company
(the  Collateral ). On June 28, 2016, the Company determined that the Loan was uncollectible, and the holders of the
Collateral agreed to cancel the Shares. In lieu of the cancellation of the Shares, the Loan has been cancelled.    

Note
11 - STATUTORY RESERVE   

In accordance with the laws and regulations
of the PRC, a wholly owned Foreign Invested Enterprise s income, after the payment of the PRC income taxes, shall be allocated
to the statutory reserves.  The allocation is 10% of the net income and the cumulative allocations are not to exceed
(Note 4) 50% of the registered capital.  However, the laws do not prohibit enterprises to allocate net income to this
reserve after the limit of fifty percent (50%) of registered capital has been reached.  These reserves are not transferable
to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. These reserves are therefore not available for distribution except
in liquidation. As of September 30, 2016(unaudited) and December 31, 2015, the Company has not allocated to these non-distributable
reserve funds due to losses sustained in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.

Note
13 - CURRENT VULNERABILITY DUE TO CERTAIN RISK FACTORS   

The
Company s operations are carried out entirely in the PRC.  Accordingly, the Company s business, financial
condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, by the general
state of the PRC's economy.  The Company s business may be influenced by changes in governmental policies with
respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods
of taxation, among other things.

Organization
History    

Ceetop
Inc. (formerly China Ceetop)    

Ceetop Inc. (formerly China Ceetop. com, Inc.)
was incorporated in Oregon on February 18, 2003 under the name of GL Gold Inc. On June 6, 2003, the Company filed an amendment
with the State of Oregon changing its name to Oregon Gold, Inc. On January 7, 2011, Oregon Gold Inc. changed its name to China
Ceetop.com, Inc. On January 27, 2011, the Company became the holding company of Surry Holding Limited ( Surry ) through
a reverse acquisition. On September 12, 2013, the Company changed its name to Ceetop Inc. 

Ceetop
Holdings Limited (Formerly Surry)    

Surry
was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on September 18, 2009. Surry holds 100% of Westow Technology Limited ( Westow ),
a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which in turn holds 100% of Shenzhen Ceetop Network Technology Co., Limited
( SZ Ceetop ), a company incorporated in Shenzhen, Peoples  Republic of China ( PRC ) and held 100%
of Hangzhou Ceetop Network Technology Co., Limited ( HZ Ceetop ), a company incorporated in Hangzhou, PRC until it discontinued
operations, and terminated its registration on June 30, 2016. On April 3, 2015, Surry changed its name to Ceetop Holdings Limited.  

Westow
Technology Limited    

Westow
was incorporated on September 7, 2009, and owns 100% of the outstanding securities of Shenzhen Ceetop Network Technology Co.,
Limited, a company incorporated in Shenzhen, PRC.  

Westow
entered into share-holding entrustment agreements with three individuals: Fan Zhengqiang, Jin Wanxia, and Liu Weiliang (CEO of
the Company) to hold 20%, 40%, and 40%, respectively, of the equity interest of SZ Ceetop on behalf of Westow. The entrustment
agreements confirm that Westow is the actual owner of SZ Ceetop. Westow enjoys the actual shareholder s rights and has the
right to obtain any benefits received by the nominal holders. Fan Zhengqiang and Jin Wanxia have no other relationship with the
Company. No consideration was given to these individuals who held the equity of SZ Ceetop on behalf of Westow.  

Guizhou
Ceetop Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Ceetop (Hong Kong) Limited.    

Guizhou Ceetop Network Technology Co., Ltd.
(formerly Shenzhen Ceetop Network Technology Co., Ltd.) was incorporated in Shenzhen in August 2009, and changed its name and
moved to Guiyang, PRC during the second quarter of 2013.  On
June 30, 2016, the Company discontinued operations, and terminated the registration, of its subsidiary Hangzhou Ceetop Network
Technology Co., Limited. Before disposition, Hangzhou Ceetop Network Technology Co., Limited. Had minimal operations. All assets
and liabilities were rolled up to its parent company GZ Ceetop.  

On
July 24, 2014, the Company established a wholly owned company Ceetop (Hong Kong) Limited in Hong Kong under Ceetop Holdings Limited

Financial
Condition and Changes in Financial Condition   

Overall
Operating Results:   

Net Sales.     For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, sales were $nil. The lack of revenues is due to the Company transitioning
from online retail sales to business to business supply chain service.  

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses   . Our selling, general
and administrative expenses decreased to $71,627 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $144,864 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, 51% decrease; and decreased to $261,604 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $376,384 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a 30% decrease. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in salaries and reduction
of staffing in the supply chain business.  

Net
Loss  . The Company s net loss was $71,680 and $147,187 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively;
and $252,575 and $435,215 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease was due
to the decrease of expenses as a result of the transition of the business of the Company.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources:   

The
Company incurred net losses of $71,680 and $147,187 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively; $252,575
and $435,215, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, and has accumulated deficit of $10,874,016 at
September 30, 2016.  

For the year ended December 31, 2015,
our independent auditors, in their report on the financial statements, indicated the Company has experienced recurring losses
from operations and may not have enough cash and working capital to fund its operations beyond the very near term, which
raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management has made a similar note in the
financial statements.  As indicated herein, we have need of capital for the implementation of our business plan, and we
will need additional capital for continuing our operations.  We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our expenses of
operations. Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, or generate sufficient revenues, it is likely that the
Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business
plan. 

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due
to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
In consultation with our Board of Directors, we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require management s
most difficult subjective judgment:  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.    

Revenue
Recognition   

The Company s revenue recognition policies
comply with SEC Staff Accounting bulletin ( SAB ) 104 (codified in FASB ASC Topic 605).  Sales revenue is
recognized at the completion of delivery to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, no
other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured at the date of completion of delivery.  Payments
received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue. 

Accounts
Receivable/Bad Debt   

The
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable.  Management reviews the composition of
accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends
and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves.  Reserves are recorded based on
the Company s historical collation history.    

Property
and Equipment   

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred;
additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized.  When property, plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed
of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in
operations.  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

The
Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the Codification addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets and supersedes previous accounting guidance,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,  and  Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of
a Business.   The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used,
which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present
and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts.  In
that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived
assets.  Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values
are reduced for the cost of disposal. Based on its review, the Company believes that, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there were no impairments of its long-lived assets.  

Income
Taxes   

The Company applies
FASB ASC 740-10,  Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes , which provides clarification related to the process associated
with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in financial statements. ASC 740-10 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold
for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. ASC 740-10
also provides guidance related to, among other things, classification, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax
positions, and disclosure requirements. 

All
of the Company s income is generated in the PRC, and accordingly, its income tax provision is calculated based on the applicable
tax rates and existing legislation, interpretation and practices in respect thereof.  

Basic
and Diluted Income / (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings
per share are calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share .  Basic earnings per
share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares and preferred shares outstanding.  Preferred shares
are included in the denominator of basic earnings per share because preferred shares participate with common shares in the earnings
and dividends of the Company on a one-for-one basis.  Diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all
dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock
method.  Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the
time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during
the period.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Financial Instrument Topic of the Codification requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values of financial instruments.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for current assets and current liabilities qualifying as financial instruments
are a reasonable estimate of fair value.  

Share
Based Compensation   

Share-based
compensation is accounted for based on the FASB Statement No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment, an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 123  ( FAS No. 123R ) and Emerging Issue Task Force 96-18,  Accounting for Equity Instruments that
are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services  ( EITF 96-18 )
and Emerging Issue Task Force 00-18  Accounting Recognition for Certain Transactions involving Equity Instruments Granted
to Other Than Employees  ( EITF 00-18 ) (codified in FASB ASC Topic 505-50).  The Company recognized
in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income the fair value of shares, stock options and other equity-based
compensation issued to non-employees when the service provided by non-employees is completed, or the date when the shares were
issued (provided that the shares issued are fully vested and not subject to forfeiture) with the prepaid services presented as
contra equity.  This is in accordance with the consensus reached in EITF 00-18 that in the event that a note or receivable
is acquired in exchange for the fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments, the note or receivable should be displayed as
contra-equity by the granter.  The Company, as granter, interprets that the term  receivable  also embraces
prepaid service fees. For employees, the Company recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income,
the grant date fair value of the shares, stock options and other equity-based compensation over the requisite service period.

As

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the  Certifying Officers ),
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, the Certifying Officers carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Their evaluation
was carried out with the participation of the Company s management. Based upon their evaluation, the Certifying Officers
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company only having one person
serving on its Board of Directors who also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  

Notwithstanding
the conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by this
report, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer believe that the financial statements and other information
contained in this quarterly report present fairly, in all material respects, our business, financial condition and results of
operations.  Nothing has come to the attention of management that causes them to believe that any material inaccuracies
or errors exist in our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.   

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with management s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
