NOTE   

  Corning
Natural Gas Holding Corporation ( Holding Company ) is a successor issuer to Corning Natural Gas Corporation ( Gas
Company ) as of November 12, 2013 as a result of a share-for-share exchange, creating a holding company structure. As of
November 12, 2013, the Gas Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding Company.  

As
used in this Form 10-K, the term  Company ,  we  or  us  refers to the consolidated companies,
the terms  Gas Company  and  Corning Gas  mean Corning Natural Gas Corporation, and the term  Pike 
means Pike County Light   Power Company, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Except as otherwise stated, the information
contained in this Form 10-K is as of September 30, 2016.  

PART
I   

  ITEM
1   BUSINESS  

General

The
Holding Company was incorporated in New York in July 2013 to serve as a holding company for the Gas Company and its dormant subsidiary
the Appliance Company. The Holding Company has 50% ownership interests in our joint ventures Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC
( Leatherstocking Gas ), which includes its subsidiary, Leatherstocking Gas Development Corporation, and Leatherstocking
Pipeline Company, LLC ( Leatherstocking Pipeline ). On August 31, 2016, the Company completed the stock purchase acquisition
of Pike County Light   Power Company ( Pike ). As used in this document, the term  the Company  refers
to the consolidated operations of the Holding Company, Gas Company, Pike and Appliance Company.  

The
Company s principal executive offices are located at 330 W. William Street, Corning New York, 14830 and the telephone number
is (607) 936-3755.  

Business

The
Company s primary business, through its subsidiaries Corning Gas and Pike, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning
Gas, the principal subsidiary, serves approximately 15,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the
Corning, Hammondsport and Virgil, New York, areas and two other gas utilities which serve the Elmira and Bath, New York, areas.
It is franchised to supply gas service in all of the political subdivisions in which it operates. It also transports and compresses
gas for a gas producer from the producer s gathering network into an interstate pipeline. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction
of the New York Public Service Commission ( NYPSC ) which oversees and sets rates for New York gas distribution companies.
In addition, the Gas Company has contracts with Corning Incorporated and Woodhull Municipal Gas Company, a small local utility,
to provide maintenance service on their gas lines. Pike is an electric and gas utility regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission ( PAPUC ). It provides electric service to approximately 4,600 customers in the Townships of Westfall,
Milford and the northern part of Dingman and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras. Pike provides natural gas service to 1,200
customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras. All of these communities are located in Pike County, Pennsylvania.
Additionally Leatherstocking Gas distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania, and has an application pending
before the NYPSC for authority to provide gas distribution services in Broome County, New York. Leatherstocking Pipeline, an unregulated
company, serves one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania.  

Gas
and Electric Supply   

Corning
Gas has contracted with various sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. The Gas Company contracts for pipeline
capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately 736,000 dekatherms ( Dth ). The Company manages its transportation
and storage capacity with internal resources. Pike has contracted with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. ( O R )
to provide electricity and natural gas according to agreements for a term of three years.  

Corning
Gas secured the NYPSC-required fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2016-2017 winter season and is managing its storage
and gas supply contracts following its gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season,
gas supply, flowing and storage, will be adequate to serve its approximately 15,000 customers.  

Corning
Gas does not expect a shortage of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over
the last several years has been positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity
to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural
gas, and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable sources. We also have confidence that our agreement with
O R will enable Pike to meet all of our electric and gas needs for Pike s customers.  

Seasonality   

For
both Corning Gas and Pike, business is highly seasonal in nature, sales for each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable.
Sales vary depending on seasonal variations in temperature. Corning Gas and Pike s gas sales peak in the winter, while Pike s
electric sales peak in the summer.  

Significant
Customers   

The
Gas Company has four major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric   Gas, Bath Electric, Gas   Water
Systems, and Repsol Energy North America ( Repsol , formerly Talisman Energy USA Incorporated). Although Repsol is
a significant customer, the Gas Company does not deliver gas to Repsol. Rather the Gas Company receives gas from several of Repsol s
gathering systems and wells, and transports its gas through our system. These customers accounted for approximately 18.14% of
our revenues in fiscal 2016 and 18.8% in fiscal 2015. The loss of any of these customers would have an adverse or material impact
on our financial results.  

Employees   

The
Company had 59 employees as of September 30, 2016, and 58 as of September 30, 2015. Of this total, nearly half are union labor
working under a union contract effective until April 2, 2018.  

Competition   

Historically,
the competition in the Gas Company s residential market has been primarily from electricity for cooking, water heating and
clothes drying, and to a small degree, electricity, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison
to that of alternative fuels in our service territory and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial
markets continues to be strong. Over 90 percent of our residential customers heat with gas. When we expand our distribution system
to attract new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels
today.  

Environmental
Regulation   

We
believe we are in compliance with present federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We
do not expect that continued compliance with these requirements will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures,
earnings and financial position. The Company has no former manufactured gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental
proceedings, litigation or complaints.  

Regulatory
Matters   

The
Gas Company is regulated by the NYPSC. On October 19, 2015, the NYPSC adopted the terms of a Joint Proposal for Extension of Gas
Rate Plan ( Extension Joint Proposal ) by the Staff of the NYPSC, the Gas Company and other parties to the proceedings.
This Extension Joint Proposal  

  settled
all contested issues among the parties pertaining to a two-year extension, with modifications, of the original 2012 Joint Proposal s
three year Gas Rate Plan. On June 17, 2016, the Gas Company made a filing with the NYPSC in Case 16-G-0369, a three-year plan
to implement a levelized increase in revenues from gas delivery service of $3,463,287 in each year for the period June 1, 2017
through May 31, 2020, resulting in total bill impacts on customers in each year of 10.4 percent. See  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Regulatory Matters  for key terms of the
Extension Joint Proposal and the Case 16-G-0369 filing. Pike is regulated by the PAPUC.  

Pike
is operating under a rate order issued effective September 1, 2014 and extended to March 1, 2018 under the terms of our acquisition
(see below under the heading  Regulatory Matters   Pike ).  

Other
Recent Developments   

As
previously reported, on October 13, 2015, the Holding Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with O R for the purchase
of all of the outstanding capital stock of Pike, a Pennsylvania corporation operating as a regulated electric and gas utility
serving approximately 5,800 customers in Pike County, Pennsylvania. The purchase price for the stock of Pike was $13.1 million,
with a closing date working capital adjustment of $1.9 million, and assumption of $3.2 million in Pike County Light   Power s
outstanding bonds. The acquisition closed on August 31, 2016. O R provides transition assistance pursuant to a Transition
Services Agreement (the  TSA ), and continues to supply electric power and gas to Pike County pursuant to Electric
and Gas Supply Agreements (the  ESA  and  GSA ). The TSA is for a term of up to twelve months and provides
monthly customer services and operations support. The GSA and TSA are each for a term of 36 months, with up to three 12-month
renewal terms. See  Risk Factors  and Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Exhibits to this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  

  The
acquisition of Pike was financed in part by financing from M T Bank, including a $12.0 million term loan, a $2.0 million line
of credit, one or more letters of credit with a limit of up to $2.5 million and an initial amount of $2.1 million, issued to O R
as collateral security for the obligations of Pike under the TSA, ESA and GSA. The debt is guaranteed by The Holding Company.
Immediately after the closing, the Holding Company caused Pike to issue a notice of redemption to the holders of its $3.2 million
in bonds, to repurchase the bonds at 100.4% of their principal amount effective October 2, 2016. See  Risk Factors 
and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital
Resources  below for additional information.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.  

    Our
operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of natural gas and electricity.    

  Prices
for natural gas are subject to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply and other market conditions. While these
costs are usually passed on to customers of the Gas Company pursuant to natural gas adjustment clauses, and to customers of Pike
through the gas rate cost and default service charges, and therefore do not pose a direct risk to earnings, we are unable to predict
what effect a sharp increase in natural gas prices may have on our customers  energy consumption or ability to pay. Higher
prices to customers can lead to higher bad debt expense and customer conservation. Higher prices may also have an adverse effect
on our cash flow as we are typically required to pay for our natural gas and electricity prior to receiving payments for the natural
gas from our customers.  

    Operational
issues beyond our control could have an adverse effect on our business.    

  The
Gas Company s ability to provide natural gas depends both on our own operations and facilities and that of third parties,
including local gas producers and natural gas pipeline operators from whom we receive our natural gas supply. The loss of use
or destruction of our facilities or the facilities of third parties due to extreme weather conditions, breakdowns, war, acts of
terrorism or other occurrences could greatly reduce potential earnings and cash flows and increase our costs of repairs and replacement
of assets. Although we carry property insurance to protect our assets, and regulatory policies of the NYPSC provide the opportunity
for deferral and recovery of extraordinary incremental costs associated with losses for such incidents for the Gas Company, our
losses may not be fully recoverable through insurance or customer rates. Pike has similar risks to the Gas Company and similar
regulatory policies and insurance coverage to mitigate such risks.  

    Significantly
warmer than normal weather conditions may affect the sale of natural gas and significantly cooler than normal weather could affect
our electric sales. Either could adversely impact our financial position and the results of our operations.     

  The
demand for natural gas and electricity are directly affected by weather conditions. Significantly warmer than normal weather conditions
in the winter in our service areas could reduce our earnings and cash flows as a result of lower gas sales. Corning Gas mitigates
the risk of warmer winter weather through the weather normalization and revenue decoupling clauses in our tariffs. These clauses
allow the Gas Company to surcharge customers for under-recovery of revenue. Pike and Leatherstocking Gas have neither weather
normalization nor revenue decoupling to mitigate the risk of warmer weather in the winter or cooler weather in the summer.  

    There
are inherent risks associated with storing and transporting natural gas, which could cause us to incur significant financial losses.    

  There
are inherent hazards and operation risks in gas transportation and distribution activities, such as leaks, accidental explosions
and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses. There are also risks associated with the distribution of
electricity. These risks could, if they occur, result in the loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental
pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses. The location of pipelines, storage facilities and electric distribution
near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level
of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and administrative proceedings that could
result in substantial monetary judgments, fines or penalties. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not
fully covered by insurance, they could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.  

Changes
in regional economic conditions could reduce the demand for natural gas and electricity.    

  The
Gas Company s business follows the economic cycle of the customers in our service regions: Corning, Bath, Virgil, and Hammondsport,
New York. A falling, slow or sluggish economy that would reduce the demand for natural gas in the areas in which we are doing
business by forcing temporary plant shutdowns, closing operations or slow economic growth would reduce our earnings potential.
One major customer has announced they will close a plant in the service area of the Gas Company if the customer, who accounted
for approximately 1.9% and 1.4% of revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, is unable to sell the facility. Pike is less
likely to be affected by a sluggish economy as it presently has no large industrial customers.  

Many
of our commercial and industrial customers use natural gas in the production of their products.  During economic downturns,
these customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of natural
gas they require for production.  

During
any economic slowdown there is typically an increase in individual and corporate customer bankruptcies.  An increase in customer
bankruptcies would increase our bad debt expenses and reduce our cash flows.  

Our
earnings may decrease in the event of adverse regulatory actions.    

Most
of our operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the NYPSC or the PAPUC. The NYPSC and PAPUC approve the rates that we may
charge to our customers. If we are required in a rate proceeding to reduce the rates we charge our customers, or if we are unable
to obtain approval for rate relief, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, including costs that may be incurred
in connection with mandated infrastructure improvements, our earnings would decrease.  

We
face a variety of risks associated with acquiring and integrating new business operations as we expand into Pennsylvania.    

We
are currently expanding our operations into Pennsylvania through our Leatherstocking joint ventures and the acquisition of Pike
from O R. The growth and success of our Pennsylvania businesses will depend to a great extent on our joint venture partner,
Mirabito Regulated Industries, LLC, and on our ability to integrate the operations of Pike and any other businesses that we acquire.
The integration of the management, personnel, operations, products, services, technologies, and facilities of any businesses that
we acquire could involve unforeseen difficulties. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract our management
and employees, and increase our expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
operating results.  

There
could be material issues concerning an acquired business that are not uncovered in the course of due diligence performed prior
to the acquisition and there could be factors outside of our control that later arise. As a result of these factors, after an
acquisition is completed, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations or incur impairment or
other charges that could result in our reporting losses.  

Our
success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of significant employees, the loss of which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.    

Our
success depends in large part upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees. Although we have entered
into an employment agreement with Michael I. German, our president and chief executive officer, he can terminate his agreement
on ninety days  notice. Other significant employees, who entered into change of control agreements on April 17, 2012 and
December 16, 2016, may terminate their employment at any time. The loss of the services of any significant employee could have
a material adverse effect on our business.  

Concentration
of share ownership among our largest shareholders may prevent other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.    

The
six largest holders of our common stock own approximately 59% of the outstanding stock. As a result, if any chose to act together,
they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including
the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets
and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other shareholders with differing
interests from these shareholders.  

Our
cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures.    

We
may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet all of our cash needs.  As part of the Gas Company s
2012 rate order extension issued in 2015 by the NYPSC, we have estimated capital expenditures to upgrade our distribution system
of approximately $5.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and $5.0 million in fiscal year 2018 that are related to system reliability
and other commitments.  We also continue to have debt retirement obligations of approximately $5.5 million in 2017, $3.7
million in 2018, $3.8 million in 2019, $3.9 million in 2020 and $12.0 million in 2021.  Additionally, we estimate investments
into Leatherstocking Gas of approximately $300,000 and $600,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, respectively, to fund its one-half
of the cost (based on ownership interest) of capital projects.  

We
will require additional financing which may be difficult or costly to obtain.    

In
order to fund our extraordinary capital expenditures we will need to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing. The sale
of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.  The incurrence of debt would result in increased
debt service obligations and could result in  

  operating
and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.  Additional financing for the Gas Company requires NYPSC approval
and for Pike requires PAPUC approval. Additional financing for either company may have unacceptable terms or may not be available
at all for various reasons including:  

*  
     limits placed on us by our current lenders in our loan agreements,  
 
       *   
      our future
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows,   
 
       *   
      our inability to meet
    our business plan,   
 
       *   
      lenders  or investors 
    perception of, and demand for, securities of natural gas utilities, and   
 
       *   
      conditions of the capital
    markets in which we may seek to raise funds.   

If
we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to finance the expansion and mandated upgrading of
our distribution system, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements.
This financing could be adversely affected by the above factors.  

    The
Company s profitability may be adversely affected by increased competition.

ITEM
7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Overview   

The
Holding Company s primary business, through its subsidiaries, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas, the
principal subsidiary, serves approximately 15,000 customers through over 425 miles of pipeline in the Corning, Hammondsport and
Virgil, New York areas. The market for natural gas in our traditional service territory is relatively saturated with limited growth
potential. However, growth opportunities do exist in extending our mains to areas adjacent or reasonably close to areas we currently
serve. In addition, the Gas Company continues to see expansion opportunities in the commercial and industrial markets. Pike serves
approximately 4,600 electric and 1,200 gas customers in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Economic activity and population growth offers
the opportunity for revenue improvement. In addition, the Holding Company has 50% interests in two joint ventures, Leatherstocking
Gas Company, LLC and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC, to pipe gas to areas of the northeast currently without gas service.
We continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and making capital investments to improve our infrastructure.  

Our
key performance indicators are net income and shareholders  equity.  

In
2016, our consolidated net income was approximately $3.1 million, an increase of approximately $1.3 million from 2015, mainly
due to the bargain purchase adjustment for the stock acquisition of Pike of $1.2 million. This is a one-time transaction related
to the acquisition of Pike in August.  

As
the parent of regulated utility companies, shareholders  equity is an important performance indicator for us. The NYPSC
and PAPUC allows the Gas Company and Pike to earn a reasonable return on its book equity. Shareholders  equity is a precursor
of future earnings potential. In 2016, shareholders  equity increased approximately $2.1 million due mainly to an increase
in paid in capital of $406,060 and increase to retained earnings of $1.6 million which represents net income for the period less
dividends declared.  

Other
performance indicators that management tracks at the Gas Company include leak repair, main and service replacements and customer
service metrics. In 2016, we invested approximately $7.2 million in system improvement and projects, repairing 327 leaks and replacing
774 services and 14.6 miles of main. In 2015, we invested $5.8 million in system improvement and projects, repairing 292 leaks
and replacing 492 services and 6.9 miles of main. At Pike, we are currently designing metrics to evaluate performance of both
electric and gas.  

Our
customer service group has implemented several changes to positively impact our customers. Beginning in 2007, customers have had
the option of third party payment of their gas bill through their banking institution. We have also instituted online meter reading.
Bill processing has been consolidated to shorten the time between meter readings and mailing, allowing a more direct link between
the consumption of gas and the receipt by the customer of their bill. In 2015, due to our new customer information system we were
able to institute on-line bill paying. Our principal customer service metric is the number of customer complaints. In 2016 and
2015, the NYPSC reported 8 complaints annually against the Gas Company. None of these complaints were marked as major or unresolved
against the Gas Company since all were resolved in a timely manner. A similar metric exists in Pennsylvania for both Leatherstocking
Gas and Pike.  

Earnings   

Earnings
on a consolidated basis were as follows:  

2016
compared with 2015.  In 2016 our operating revenue decreased by approximately $2.8 million or 12.4% primarily due to lower
gas costs (which are a pass-through item) and decreased consumption due to warmer weather offset by more favorable regulatory
reconciliations. The increase in other gas revenues of $322,310 from fiscal 2015 to 2016 was mainly attributable to a one-time
regulatory reconciliations for the revenue decoupling mechanism ( RDM ) which refunds or surcharges customers to reflect
differences between delivery revenue and the revenue target in the last rate case and for the annual merchant function charge
( MFC ) adjustment which measures recovery of administrative costs against targets in the last rate case in in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. There was also an increase in target customer reconciliations in fiscal 2016.  

Our
utility gas margin (the excess of utility operating revenues over the cost of natural gas purchased) decreased $199,956 from 2015
to 2016. This decline was mainly attributable to lower volumes sold due to warmer weather. There has been a decrease of $3.2 million
in purchased gas costs due to lower volumes of gas purchased and lower gas costs. The decrease in purchased gas costs led to a
margin percentage increase of 11.19%. For the first time, we also have a utility electric margin of $360,620 for the one month
we owned Pike in fiscal 2016.  

We
anticipate that the cost of gas should remain relatively stable because of our access to local production and current economic
and government projections. The cost of electricity should also remain relatively stable because of Pike s agreement with
O R.  

Operating
Expenses   

2016
compared with 2015.  Operating and maintenance expenses decreased $169,415 from 2015 to 2016 mainly because of a decrease in
expenses related to leak repair of $225,160 and a decrease in insurance costs of $87,446 that partly offset transaction costs
associated with the acquisition and reporting required for Pike of $137,462. The transaction costs are a one-time occurrence that
we will not have in fiscal 2017. Depreciation increased by $136,904 from 2015 to 2016 due to increases to plant.  

Investment
Income   

2016
compared with 2015.  Investment income decreased by $31,027 to $102,524 in 2016 due to lower realized gains and dividends on
the Company s marketable securities.  

Effective
Tax Rate   

There
was an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 37.5% for the year ended September 30, 2015.
In 2016, the gain on the bargain purchase adjustment related to the purchase of Pike is included in net income but not
taxable. Without the bargain purchase the effective tax rate would have been
36.2%.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Internally
generated cash from operating activities consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in operating assets
and liabilities. Non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of securities and deferred income
taxes. Over or under recovered gas costs significantly impact cash flow. In addition, there are significant year-to-year changes
in regulatory assets that impact cash flow. Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures,
investments in our joint ventures and business acquisitions. As part of our 2012 rate order extension issued in 2015 by the NYPSC
(the  Joint Proposal Extension ), we have estimated capital expenditures to upgrade our distribution system of approximately
$5.5 million in fiscal 2017, and approximately $5.0 million in fiscal years 2018. We expect to finance these planned capital
expenditures with a combination of cash provided by operations and issuance of additional long-term debt and equity.  

The
earnings sharing mechanism approved by the NYPSC in the 2012 rate order and extended in the Joint Proposal Extension provides
for sharing between Corning Gas shareholders and customers of the earned return on equity (ROE) above certain levels. Under the
earnings sharing mechanism, Corning Gas is allowed to retain all earnings up to and including a 9.4% ROE level, 50% of earnings
above 9.4% up to and including 9.8%, 20% of earnings above 9.8% up to and including 10.2%, and 10.0% of earnings above 10.2%.
We believe that these limits do not have a significant effect on our liquidity because even at those limits we have sufficient
cash collected from our earnings to support operations.  

Cash
flows from financing activities consist of sales of Company stock, dividends paid, repayment of long-term debt, new debt and changes
in the outstanding balances of our lines-of-credit. For Corning Gas, we have a revolving line of credit of $8.0 million at a variable
interest rate determined by the Gas Company s funded debt to EBITDA ratio calculated ninety days after the end of each quarter
added to the daily LIBOR rate. This line expires on April 1, 2017. The amount outstanding under this line on September 30, 2016
was approximately $7.5 million with an interest rate of 3.2%. Our lender has a purchase money security interest in all our natural
gas purchases utilizing funds advanced by the bank under the credit agreement and all proceeds of sale and accounts receivable
from the sale of that gas. Pike also has a revolving line of credit of $2.0 million at an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.75%
with principal repayable on demand by the Lender. As of September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding on this line was $700,000 with
an interest rate of 3.3125%.  

To
provide additional liquidity required for the purchase of Pike and other liquidity requirements, on December 16, 2015, the Board
of Directors of the Holding Company declared a dividend of one subscription right for each share of common stock outstanding as
of the record date of April 14, 2016, which was distributed to shareholders on or about April 28, 2016. Each non-transferable
subscription right entitled the holder to purchase either: (i) one-eighth share of our 6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, for $25.00 per share or (ii) one-sixth share of our 4.8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, for $20.75 per share, each of which is convertible in accordance with its terms into one share of common
stock, subject to adjustment. The Company completed the rights offering on June 23, 2016. No fractional shares of preferred stock
were issued. Of the 140,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock available, 105,303 shares were subscribed and of the
360,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock available, 244,263 shares were subscribed. Of these shares 7,915 were purchased
by the Company s Rabbi Trust and are included as marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet for approximately
$197,000. The total cash received, less issuance costs, was approximately $7.5 million. Each shareholder exercising over-subscription
rights was able to purchase all of the additional shares of preferred stock for which the shareholder subscribed. The issuance
of preferred shares will also result in additional cash requirements for dividend payments.  

On
September 30, 2016, we had $36.9 million in long term debt outstanding. We repaid $764,005 during fiscal year 2016 consistent
with the requirements of our debt instruments and refinancing activities.  

Prior
to April 2014, the Gas Company contracted with a third-party to manage its gas supply and storage. Starting in April 2014, the
Gas Company assumed responsibility for managing its gas supply assets. At September 30, 2016, the Gas Company had 565,014 dekatherms
at $903,007 in storage. As the result of these actions, we anticipate that the Gas Company will have sufficient gas to supply
our customers for the 2016-2017 winter heating season. The contract with O R should provide for sufficient electricity and
natural gas to supply Pike for the 2016-2017 winter heating and summer cooling demand.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we believe that cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our lines of credit will be sufficient
to satisfy debt service requirements over the next twelve months. We believe modifications or refinancing of current debt amounts,
as well as new debt and proceeds from equity will be required to satisfy our capital expenditures to finance our internal growth
needs for the next twelve months.  

Other
Comprehensive Income   

Until
2015, other comprehensive income ( OCI ) was comprised of unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale
as required by FASB ASC 320 and pension liability adjustments as required by FASB ASC 715. In fiscal year 2015, the Company determined
that it met the criteria to record the minimum pension liability as a regulatory asset in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-5. Adjustments
to OCI and regulatory assets were recorded in that year in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-8 because the criteria established was
determined to have been met. The amount of the regulatory asset was $3,665,926. The increase to OCI was $2,748,238. For additional
information, see Note 5 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Now OCI is comprised of unrealized gains or losses
on securities available for sale and was $66,237 and ($98,749) for September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Contractual
Obligations   

The
following tables summarize the Gas Company s expected future contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2016, and
the twelve month periods over which they occur.  

The
projected benefit obligation of the benefit plan has been calculated based on the census and plan provisions, as well as a number
of economic and demographic assumptions. The discount rate for the period ending September 30, 2016 is 4.2% and is assumed to
be the rate going forward. A decrease in the discount rate of 1% could increase the projected benefit obligation by $3.1 million
and an increase in the discount rate could decrease the obligation by $2.5 million. Either would impact the estimated pension
plan payment for future periods.  

   Lines
of Credit and Short Term Debt   

  On
October 27, 2015, the Gas Company extended its line of credit agreement with Community Bank N.A. ( Community
Bank ) in the amount of $8.5 million that originally was to expire on April 1, 2016. Borrowings outstanding on this
line were $0 and $7,003,599 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The maximum amount outstanding during the years
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $8,406,484 and $7,581,344, respectively. The interest rate was calculated as the
30-day Libor Rate plus 2.5%. As security for the Gas Company s line of credit, Community Bank has a purchase money
interest in all of our natural gas purchases utilizing funds advanced by Community Bank under the line-of-credit agreement
and all proceeds of sale of the gas to customers and related accounts receivable. Under the terms of this line the Gas
Company is required to maintain a debt to tangible net worth ratio of less than 2.5 to 1.0 and a debt service coverage ratio
of 1.1 to 1.0. On September 30, 2015, the interest rate was 3.0%. This line of credit was closed in January 2016.  

On
October 19, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas and Five Star Bank entered into an agreement which allows Leatherstocking Gas to
borrow up to $500,000 as a line-of-credit note with interest only payments due at a variable rate equal to the prime rate
announced in the Wall Street Journal on a monthly basis. The note will convert to a permanent loan payable over five years on
a ten year amortization schedule. When the loan converts,  Leatherstocking Gas will decide on either a fixed rate or
variable rate. There was a draw of $500,000, also on October 19, 2015. This required an investment of approximately $166,667
from each of the equity holders. Leatherstocking Pipeline is a guarantor of this loan. The interests of the Holding Company
and Mirabito Regulated Industries, LLC in equal parts have been pledged as additional collateral. The purpose of this credit
note is to finance the continued and additional infrastructure cost of the construction project in Northern Pennsylvania. 

On
August 17, 2015, the Gas Company entered into a Term Note and Agreement with M T in the amount of $2,000,000 with an interest
rate of 2.3 percentage points above LIBOR for the purpose of short term financing of mandated construction projects. The maturity
date of this note was November 17, 2015. On October 14, 2015, the Gas Company entered into a Term Note and Agreement with M T
in the amount of $1,000,000 with an interest rate of 2.75 percentage points above LIBOR for the purpose of short term financing
of mandated construction projects. The maturity date of this note was January 14, 2016. On November 6, 2015, the Gas Company entered
into a Term Note and Agreement with M T in the amount of $3,000,000 that consolidated the notes for $2,000,000 and $1,000,000
into a new note that had a maturity date of February 6, 2016. This note has an interest rate of 2.75 percentage points above LIBOR.
This note was refinanced at maturity.  

On
January 27, 2016, the Gas Company entered into an agreement with M T for a revolving line of credit of $8.0 million at a variable
interest rate determined by the Gas Company s funded debt to EBITDA ratio calculated ninety days after the end of each quarter
added to the daily LIBOR rate. This line expires on April 1, 2017. The amount outstanding under this line on September 30, 2016
was approximately $7.5 million with an interest rate of 3.2%. The maximum amount outstanding during the year ended September 30,
2016 was $7,818,800. Our lender has a purchase money security interest in all our natural gas purchases utilizing funds advanced
by the bank under the credit agreement and all proceeds of sale and accounts receivable from the sale of that gas.  

On
August 31, 2016, Pike entered into an agreement with M T for a $2.0 million revolving line of credit at an interest rate equal
to LIBOR plus 2.75% with principal repayable on demand by the Lender. As of September 30, 2016, Pike had drawn $700,000 at an
interest rate of 3.3%. The agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants of Pike including, (i) a total funded
debt to tangible net worth ratio of not greater than 1.4 to 1.0, (ii) a total funded debt to EBITDA ratio of not greater than
3.75 to 1.0, and (iii) a minimum cash flow overage of not less than 1.1 to 1.0, with each of the financial covenants measured
quarterly based on Pike s trailing twelve month operating performance and fiscal quarterly financial statements commencing
with the period ended September 30, 2017; compliance, accounting, and financial statement requirements, and prohibitions on changes
in management or control, any sale of all or substantially all of its assets, acquisitions of substantially all the asset of any
other entity, or other material changes to its business, purposes, structure or operations which could materially adversely affect
Pike.  

In
addition, M T Bank issued to O R a letter of credit in the amount of $2.125 million as security for the obligations of
Pike under the Transition Services Agreement, the Electric Supply Agreement and the Gas Supply and Gas Transportation Agreement,
each, as amended, dated August 31, 2016, to provide for the provision by O R of certain transition services for 12 months
with up to six one month extensions, and three years of electric and gas supply for the customers of Pike, with up to three one-year
extensions.  

Regulatory
Matters    

Holding
Company   

On
April 11, 2016, the Holding Company filed a petition in Case 16-G-0200 with the NYPSC, seeking a declaratory ruling that Public
Service Law Section 70(4), which pertains to the acquisition of more than 10 percent of the voting capital stock of a gas corporation,
does not apply to the exercise of rights to convert the 4.8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note 8   Stockholders
Equity for additional information) to common stock of the Holding Company, or that, if that section is applicable at all to the
Holding Company, there is no need for NYPSC approval under the statute because the relevant subscription rights are to be issued
pro-rata to existing shareholders, thereby limiting the potential changes in relative ownership concentration that are the focus
of Section 70(4). In the alternative, if the NYPSC determines that the statute applies to the conversion of preferred shares to
common shares in the Holding Company, the Holding Company requested that the NYPSC approve such acquisition of common shares by
shareholders of the Holding Company whose ownership interests exceed 10 percent of the Holding Company s stock. On August
1, 2016, the NYPSC issued an order in Case 16-G-0200. Although the NYPSC declined to issue the requested declaratory ruling that
Public Service Law 70(4) is inapplicable, the NYPSC approved the exercise of conversion rights on a Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock by our three holders of 10% or more of our common stock. The three holders, our President Michael German, funds controlled
or with investments managed by Mario Gabelli, and the Article 6 Marital Trust under the First Amended and Restated Jerry Zucker
Revocable Trust, reported on filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that they acquired 57,936, 73,398 and 0
shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively. There can be no assurance that any of such shares will actually
be converted into our common stock.  

The
Holding Company s primary business, through its subsidiaries Corning Gas and Pike, is regulated by the NYPSC and PAPUC,
among other agencies.  

Gas
Company   

On
May 24, 2011, the Gas Company filed Case 11-G-0280, a base rate case that requested an increase in revenues for a three year period
ending April 30, 2015. On April 20, 2012, the NYPSC issued a final order in the case accepting a January 13, 2012 Joint Proposal
(the  2012 Joint Proposal ) of the parties to the case, including the Gas Company and the NYPSC Staff, to resolve
all issues in the rate case, with rates effective May 1, 2012 and subject to adjustment during the three year period ending April
30, 2015.  

On
July 15, 2015, the Company, NYPSC Staff and the other parties to Case 11-G-0280 filed a Joint Proposal for Extension of Gas Rate
Plan ( Extension Joint Proposal ). This Extension Joint Proposal settled all contested issues among the parties pertaining
to a two-year extension, with modifications, of the original 2012 Joint Proposal s three year Gas Rate Plan. Except as modified
by the Extension Joint Proposal, the terms of the 2012 Joint Proposal continue in effect and the delivery rates established by
the 2012 Joint Proposal continue in effect through April 30, 2017. The Extension Joint Proposal provided for the Gas Company to
establish a  Safety and Reliability  customer surcharge on its customers to recover certain carrying costs on approved
infrastructure improvements for the period of the extension. The Extension Joint Proposal also resolved a property tax issue and
requires the Gas Company to return to customers a  Gas System Benefit Charge  over collection (a regulatory liability
of the Gas Company) over a three year period. In addition, the Extension Joint Proposal reduced the 2012 Joint Proposal s
Return on Equity ( ROE ) threshold for the commencement of sharing by customers of excess earnings, from 9.5% to 9.0%,
thereby increasing the opportunity for customer sharing at various ROE levels above that threshold. On October 19, 2015, the NYPSC
adopted the terms of the Extension Joint Proposal, including the Safety and Reliability Charge which permits the Gas Company to
collect approximately $466,000 in the first twelve months (May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2016), and approximately $575,000 in
the second twelve months (May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017), of the extended Gas Rate Plan, for a total of approximately $1,041,000.
Due to the timing of the NYPSC order adopting the Extension Joint Proposal, the collection period was condensed and started November
1, 2015; it will end April 30, 2017. The return of the Gas System Benefit Charge over-collection and elimination of its prospective
collection (a regulatory liability) partially offset the collections on the Safety and Reliability Charge, resulting in a total
cash flow increase expected over the two year term of the Extension Joint Proposal of approximately $426,000.  

The
Gas Company, on August 6, 2015, filed a petition in Case 15-G-0460 seeking authority to issue $34,768,837 in long term debt to
fund its capital expenditures for the period 2015-2021. The amount requested in the petition reflected the deduction of $1,440,223,
the amount by which previous issuances had exceeded the authorized amount. In an order issued on January 21, 2016, in Case 15-G-0460
(the  Financing Order ), the NYPSC authorized the Gas Company to issue by December 31, 2017, a total of $28.4 million
of long-term debt to cover refinancing of existing long- and short-term debt and issuance of new long-term debt. That authorization
included refinancing of $15.3 million of existing long-term debt and $13.1 million in new long-term debt. The latter amount includes
refinancing of existing short-term debt and financing of new capital expenditures and sinking fund payments. The $17.4 million
consolidated loan and separate $4.2 million loan with M T Bank, as described in  Liquidity and Capital Resources, 
were entered into on January 27, 2016 pursuant to the NYPSC Financing Order. In the Financing Order, the NYPSC limited the authorization
of new long-term debt to the amount required to address financing needs through 2017 and required the Gas Company to consult with
the NYPSC, before filing a financing petition to address needs beyond 2017. For the refinancing of existing debt, the NYPSC s
authorization was granted on the condition that the Gas Company demonstrate savings on a net present value basis or provides proof
of other benefits prior to each financing.  

On
April 13, 2016, the Gas Company filed a petition in Case 16-G-0204 with the NYPSC, to defer leak repair and survey costs over
and above the amounts permitted to be recovered in rates for 2015. In this petition we requested that the incremental cost of
$349,547 together with the associated income tax effect, be deferred and recovered in a manner to be established in future rate
proceedings. The company has recognized this deferral in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. It is anticipated that, if the petition
is granted, the length of time these costs will be amortized may be decided as part of the pending NYPSC case (Case 16-G-0369,
described below) to determine base rates.  

On
June 17, 2016, the Gas Company made a filing with the NYPSC, in Case 16-G-0369, for a three-year plan to implement a levelized
increase in revenues from gas delivery service of $3,463,287 in each year over the period June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2020, resulting
in total bill impacts on customers in each year of 10.4 percent. The filing also indicated the Gas Company s openness to
developing a staged increase or, alternatively, a surcharge mechanism intended to permit recovery from customers of certain limited
costs over the subsequent two year-year period ending May 31, 2022. The filing with the NYPSC reflects a return on equity of 10.2
percent and pro-forma equity ratios of 50.03 percent, 50.82 percent and 49.96 percent for the 12-month periods ending May 31,
2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. In view of the Gas Company s relatively small size and to enhance access to capital markets,
the filing proposes the use of an equity ratio of 50 percent. In addition, the total revenue requirement to be recovered in levelized
base rates includes $2,643,980 of costs, including property tax and other deferrals plus plant subject to the Safety and Reliability
Charge that are currently being paid by customers through the Delivery Rate Adjustment and the Safety and Reliability Charge.
The transfer of those costs therefore contributes to the proposed increase in base rates. The Gas Company has proposed in the
rate filing that the NYPSC permit it to earn an incentive on the allowed return on equity if it exceeds certain targets set by
the NYPSC up to a maximum of 60 basis points (0.60 percent). Pursuant to the rate filing, many other aspects of the Gas Company s
current rate plan would remain in effect with little or no changes. The Gas Company and the other parties to Case 16-G-0369 have
engaged in settlement negotiations with the objective of reaching a mutually acceptable joint proposal, resolving contested issues
that can be presented to the NYPSC for its consideration. If an acceptable joint proposal cannot be agreed upon, the case would
be litigated. In either event, the Gas Company does not anticipate that a decision on new rates will be issued prior to mid-May
2017. The NYPSC may adopt rates for a multi-year period, as proposed in the filing, or it may adopt rates for a shorter period,
such as a single year.  

Pike   

The
acquisition of Pike was subject to the approval of the PAPUC. At its public meeting held on August 11, 2016, the PAPUC approved
the Recommended Decision of the Administrative Law Judge, dated June 30, 2016, which approved the Joint Petition for Full Settlement
of the Joint Application of Pike, O R and the Company, and the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate and the Pennsylvania
Officer of Small Business Advocate (the  Settlement ). The Settlement requires Pike and the Holding Company to take
a variety of actions including, among a series of other matters, hiring a general manager and other staffing of Pike, which had
no employees when owned by O R, and not filing for a rate increase prior to March 1, 2018.  

Leatherstocking
Gas   

On
February 20, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas, pursuant to Section 68 of the Public Service Law, filed with the NYPSC in Case 15-G-0128
for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and for approval of, and permission to exercise, franchises previously granted
in the Town of Windsor (Case 15-G-0098) and Village of Windsor (Case 15-G-0099). The Commission review of the applications is
pending.  

On
February 27, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas, pursuant to Public Service Law Section 69, filed with the NYPSC for authority to issue
long term indebtedness in the principal amount of $2,750,000 for the purpose of financing new construction in the Town and Village
of Windsor. The Commission review of the application in Case 15-G-0128 is pending.  

On
June 3, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas filed a petition with the PAPUC requesting authorization to issue a commercial promissory note
in the amount of $5,668,963. On July 8, 2015, the PAPUC issued an order in Docket No. S-2015-2486104 approving the petition.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Our
significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form
10-K. The application of generally accepted accounting principles involve certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Thus, the application of these principles can result in varying
results from company to company. The principles and policies that most significantly impact us are discussed below.  

Accounting
for Business Combinations   

The
Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.
As an acquirer for accounting purposes, the Company has estimated the fair value of Pike s assets and liabilities assumed
and ensured that the accounting policies of Pike were consistent with that of the Company. ASC requires that when fair value of
the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, resulting in a bargain purchase of assets, the acquirer must reassess the
reasonableness of the values assigned to all of the net assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration transferred. The
Company performed such assessment and concluded that the values assigned for the acquisition were reasonable. Purchase price allocations
are subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Administration costs
to acquire a business may include, but are not limited to, fees for accounting, legal and valuation services and are expensed
as incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In the case of the acquisition of Pike, many factors contributed
to a bargain purchase. O   R primarily operates in New York and New Jersey, and having an operation in Pennsylvania created
numerous additional operating costs given its differing jurisdiction. Additionally, Pike represented approximately 6,000 customers
as compared to O   R s overall customer base of over 100,000. Thus, the incremental operating costs were not economically
viable for O   R. Another factor contributing to the bargain purchase is that the market for utility companies the size of
Pike is relatively small, which resulted in a limited number of bidders. We recognized this bargain purchase net of deferred tax.  

Accounting
for Utility Revenue and Cost of Gas Recognition    

Corning
Gas records revenues from residential and commercial customers based on meters read on a cycle basis throughout each month, while
certain large industrial and utility customers  meters are read at the end of each month. Corning Gas does not accrue revenue
for gas delivered but not yet billed, as the NYPSC requires that such accounting be adopted during a rate proceeding, which we
have not done. Currently Corning Gas does not anticipate adopting unbilled revenue recognition nor does it believe it would have
a material impact on financial results. Our tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the cost of gas applicable
to firm customers, which includes estimates. Under these mechanisms, we periodically adjust rates to reflect increases and decreases
in the cost of gas and electricity. Annually, we reconcile the difference between the total gas costs collected from customers
and the cost of gas. We defer any excess or deficiency and subsequently either recover it from, or refund it to, customers over
the following twelve-month period for gas. Quarterly, we reconcile the difference between electric costs collected from customers
and the cost of electricity. The Default Service Charges for electricity are adjusted every quarter. To the extent estimates are
inaccurate; a regulatory asset on the balance sheet is increased or decreased. Leatherstocking Gas reads all meters at the end
of the month and therefore has no unbilled. Pike accrues for unbilled revenue monthly for customer meters read in current month
and not billed until the next month. Those revenues are provided monthly by O R as part of the TSA and are recognized as an
unbilled revenue asset, separate from customer accounts receivable.  

Accounting
for Regulated Operations - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities    

Corning
Gas is subject to regulation by NYPSC and Pike is subject to regulation by the PAPUC. We record the results of our regulated activities
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 980 (prior authoritative literature: Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71,  Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation ), which results in
differences in the application of generally, accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses. FASB
ASC 980 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue
and expense in non-regulated businesses. In certain circumstances, FASB ASC 980 allows entities whose rates are determined by
third-party regulators to defer costs as  regulatory  assets in the balance sheet to the extent that the entity expects
to recover these costs in future rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of
FASB ASC 980 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment.  

In
fiscal year 2015, the Company determined that it met the criteria to record the minimum pension liability as a regulatory asset
in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-5. Adjustments to OCI and regulatory assets were recorded in the current year in accordance
with ASC 980-715-25-8, because the criteria established was determined to be met in the current period. The amount of the regulatory
asset was $3,665,926. The increase to OCI was $2,748,238. Factors considered include consistent recovery of the pension costs
on an accrual basis historically and in the current rate case, no indication of expected changes to recovery, and the existence
of a reconciliation process to track the recovery of these costs. For these reasons management determined the Gas Company meets
the criteria as set forth in ASC 980-725-25-5. For additional information, see Note 5 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  

Accounting
for Income Taxes   

The
Holding Company uses the asset and liability method to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Holding Company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities will be adjusted
for the effects of enacted changes in tax laws and rates. Additionally, as discussed in Note 1(u) of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, we early adopted accounting guidance related to recording deferred tax assets and liabilities as long-term
as of September 30, 2016 and retrospectively applied it to the year ended September 30, 2015.  

Accounting
for the Compressor Station   

The
Gas Company bought an $11 million compressor station and $2.1 million pipeline from a local producer for two dollars in fiscal
2011. Although the Company has effectively acquired new plant with an original cost of $13.1 million, only two dollars was recognized
on the Balance Sheet in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts (313.2) which states that in the case of gas plant contributed
to the utility, gas plant accounts shall be charged only with such expenses, if any, incurred by the utility. Please see Note
1(r) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  311 Transportation Agreement/Compressor Station  for additional
information.  

Accounting
for the Joint Ventures   

The
investment and equity in Leatherstocking Gas and Leatherstocking Pipeline (collectively,  Joint Ventures ) has
been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Holding Company has accounted for its equity investment using
the equity method of accounting based on the guidelines established in FASB ASC 323. In applying the guidance of FASB ASC
323, the Holding Company recognized the investment in the Joint  Ventures as an asset at cost. The investment will
fluctuate in future periods based on the Holding Company s allocable share of earnings or losses from the Joint
Ventures which is recognized through earnings. 

Pension
and Post-Retirement Benefits   

The
amounts reported in our financial statements related to pension and other post-retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial
basis, which requires the use of many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. These assumptions include the discount rate,
the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and, for other post-retirement benefits, the expected annual
rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits. Changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial
experience could have a material impact on the amount of our pension and post-retirement benefit costs and funding requirements.
For the period ended September 30, 2015, the discount rate was prepared by utilizing an analysis of the plan s expected
future cash flows and high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period
to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used is an estimate of the rate at which a defined benefit pension plan
could settle its obligations. Rather than using a rate and curve developed using a bond portfolio, this method selects individual
bonds to match to the expected cash flows of the Plan. Management feels this provides a more accurate depiction of the true cost
to the plan to settle the obligations as the Plan could theoretically go into the marketplace and purchase the specific bonds
used in the analysis in order to settle the obligations of the Plan. In 2015, the mortality assumption used was the RP-200 annuitant/non-annuitant
Mortality Table for Males and Females with generational improvements projected using scale BB. The change in discount rate from
5.07% to 5.22% did not have a significant effect on the benefit obligation in 2015. In 2016, the mortality assumption was changed
to the sex-distinct RP-2014 Mortality Tables with improvements projected using Scale MP-2016 on a fully generational basis. This
change reduced the benefit obligation. The change in discount rate from 5.22% to 4.20% increased the benefit obligation. The net
effect of changes to the assumptions and discount rate is an increase of approximately $1.6 million to the pension benefit obligation.
However, we expect to recover substantially all our net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs attributed to
employees in accordance with NYPSC authorization. For financial reporting purposes, the difference between the amounts of such
costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability.  

Preferred
Stock and Temporary Equity   

This
is a new accounting policy effective for fiscal 2016. The Holding Company classifies conditionally redeemable convertible preferred
shares, which includes preferred shares subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within control
of the Holding Company, as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet, in accordance with the guidance enumerated
in FASB ASC No. 480-10  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Company also analyzes the embedded conversion feature
for bifurcation, based on whether the host instrument has more equity-like or debt-like characteristics. Dividends are recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings and issuance costs reduce the initial proceeds and are then accreted over the life of the
instrument to the redemption amount.  

The
Holding Company records mandatorily redeemable stock as a liability in accordance with ASC 480. Dividends are recorded as interest
expense and issuance costs are treated the same way as debt issuance costs.

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon the Company s evaluation,
the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company s internal controls over financial reporting
are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our internal controls over financial reporting is supported by appropriate reviews by management, written
policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Conduct adopted by our Company s
Board of Directors, applicable to all Company Directors and all officers and employees of our Company.  

The
Audit Committee of our Company s Board of Directors meets with the independent public accountants and management periodically
to discuss internal controls over financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews
with the independent public accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee s Report will be
reported in the Proxy Statement issued in connection with the Company s 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  

The
Company s management, including the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the
effectiveness of the  Company s internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  from 2013 .  Based upon that evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting was effective as
of September 30, 2016. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that was conducted during the last fiscal quarter for the Holding Company, the Gas
Company, the Appliance Company and the Joint Ventures, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of putting together additional controls for Pike.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

Board
of Directors and Shareholders  

  Corning
Natural Gas Holding Corporation  

  Corning,
New York  

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively,
the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, stockholders  equity and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the fiscal years
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

CORNING
NATURAL GAS HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   

(1)
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

The
Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation s (the  Holding Company ) primary business, through its
subsidiaries, Corning Natural Gas Corporation ( Corning Gas  or  Gas Company ) and Pike County Light
  Power Company ( Pike ), is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas provides gas on a commodity
and transportation basis to its customers in the Southern Tier of New York State. Pike provides electric and gas service to
customers in Pike County, Pennsylvania. As used in these notes, the term  the Company  refers to the consolidated
operations of the Holding Company, the Gas Company, Pike and the Appliance Company.  The Company follows the Uniform
System of Accounts prescribed by the Public Service Commission of the State of New York (NYPSC) which has jurisdiction over
and sets rates for New York State gas distribution companies and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
( PAPUC ) which has jurisdiction over and sets rates for Pennsylvania gas and electric distribution companies.
The Company s regulated operations meet the criteria to and, accordingly, follow the accounting and reporting of the
Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) ASC 980  Regulated Operations  .  The
Company s consolidated financial statements contain the use of estimates and assumptions for reporting certain
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and actual results could differ from the estimates. The more significant accounting
policies of the Company are summarized below. 

(a)      Principles
                                         of Consolidation and Presentation      

The
consolidated financial statements include the Holding Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Corning Gas, Pike and Appliance
Company. All intercompany accounts and balances have been eliminated.  

It
is the Company s policy to reclassify amounts in the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.  

   (b)
Property, Plant and Equipment    

  Property,
plant and equipment are stated at the historical cost of construction or acquisition. These costs include payroll, fringe benefits,
materials and supplies and transportation costs. The Company charges normal repairs to maintenance expense.  

(c)
Depreciation    

  The
Company provides for depreciation for accounting purposes using a straight-line method based on the estimated economic lives of
property and equipment as determined by the current rate plan based on the latest depreciation study. The depreciation rate used
for Corning Gas utility plant, expressed as an annual percentage of depreciable property was 1.7% and 2.2% for of the years ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The NYPSC allows the Gas Company recovery in revenues to offset costs of building certain
projects. At the time utility properties are retired, the original cost plus costs of removal less any salvage are charged to
accumulated depreciation.  

The
depreciation rate for one month for Pike utility plant was 0.3%. The annualized percentage would be 3.5%. Pike also charges the
original cost plus costs of removal less any salvage to accumulated depreciation.  

   (d)
Accounting for Impairment    

  FASB
ASC 360-10-15,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  establishes accounting standards to
account for the impairment of long-lived assets, and certain identifiable intangibles. Under FASB ASC 360-10-15, the Company reviews
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. FASB
ASC 360-10-15 also requires that a rate regulated enterprise recognize an impairment when regulatory assets are no longer probable
of recovery. No impairment losses were incurred for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(e)
Marketable Securities   

Marketable
securities, which are intended to fund the Gas Company s deferred compensation plan obligations, are classified as
available for sale. Such securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of the related income tax effect, excluded from income, and reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders  equity until realized. The cost of securities sold was determined using the
specific identification method. For all  investments in the unrealized loss position, none have been in an unrealized
loss position for more than 12 months. None are other than temporary impairments based on management s analysis of
available market research. In 2016 and 2015, the Gas Company sold equity securities for realized gains included in earnings
of $62,994 and $88,028, respectively. 

(f)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company has determined the fair value of debt and other financial instruments using a valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy,
which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, consists of three levels. Level 1 uses observable inputs such as
quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or
indirectly observable; and Level 3, which is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists,
requires the Company to develop its own  assumptions. The carrying amount of debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
approximates fair value as a result of instruments bearing interest rates that approximate current market rates for similar
instruments, and the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their
short-term nature. The assets used to fund the pension plan and marketable securities, which fund the Gas Company s
deferred compensation plan, are valued based on Level 1 inputs. 

The
Company has determined the fair value of certain assets through application of FASB ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures .  

Fair
value of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

Financial
assets and liabilities valued using level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted market prices within active markets.  

The
pension assets in Note 11 are valued using level 1 inputs.  

(g)
Cash and Cash Equivalents    

Cash
and cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities
of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions may periodically exceed federally insured limits.  

(h)
Accounts Receivable    

Accounts
receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company estimates the allowance based on its analysis of
specific balances, taking into consideration the age of past due accounts and relying on rules and guidelines established by the
NYPSC and PAPUC regarding customer disconnects. Under the terms of the Transitional Service Agreement ( TSA ) signed
as part of the Pike acquisition from Orange   Rockland Utilities, Inc. ( O R ), O R will continue to bill
Pike customers for up to twelve months after closing.  

Pike
accrues for unbilled revenue monthly for customer meters read in the current month and not billed until the next month. The unbilled
revenues are recognized as an unbilled revenue asset, separate from customer accounts receivable on the Company s Consolidated
Balance Sheet.  

Related
party receivables are expenditures paid on behalf of the Holding Company s Joint Venture investments. We expect repayment
on these amounts during the year ended September 30, 2017.  

(i)      Gas
                                         Stored Underground     

  Gas
stored underground is carried at an average unit cost method as prescribed by the NYPSC. Pike does not have any gas storage.  

   (j)
Materials and Supplies Inventories    

Materials
and supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on an average unit price basis.  

(k)
Debt Issuance Costs    

  Costs
associated with the issuance of debt by the Company are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related debt.  

   (l)
Regulatory Matters   

  Certain
costs of the Company are deferred and recognized as expenses when they are reflected in rates and recovered from customers as
permitted by FASB ASC 980. These costs are shown as regulatory assets. Such costs arise from the traditional cost-of-service rate
setting approach whereby all prudently incurred costs are generally recoverable through rates. Deferral of these costs is appropriate
while the Company s rates are regulated under a cost-of-service approach of the NYPSC and PAPUC for utilities.  

  As
regulated utilities, the Gas Company and Pike defer certain costs for future recovery. In a purely competitive environment, such
costs might have been currently expensed. Accordingly, if the Company s rate settings were changed from a cost-of-service
approach and the Gas Company and Pike were no longer allowed to defer these costs under FASB ASC 980, certain of these assets
might not be fully recoverable. However, the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of competition and continues to operate
in a cost-of-service based regulatory environment. Accordingly, the Company believes that accounting under FASB ASC 980 is appropriate .   

(m)
Revenue and Cost of Sales   

The
Gas Company records revenues from residential and commercial customers based on meters read on a cyclical basis throughout
each month, while certain large industrial and utility customers  meters are read at the end of each month. Several
meters are read at the end of each month to calculate local production revenues. The Gas Company does not accrue revenue for
gas delivered but not yet billed, as the NYPSC requires that such accounting must be adopted during a rate proceeding, which
the Gas Company has not done. The Gas Company, as part of its currently effective rate plan, has a weather normalization
clause as protection against severe weather fluctuations. This affects space heating customers and is activated when degree
days are 2.2% greater or less than the 30-year average. As a result, the effect on revenue fluctuations of weather related
gas sales is somewhat moderated.  

Pike
recognizes revenues for electric and gas service on a monthly billing cycle basis. Pike does accrue for gas and electricity delivered.
Pike does not have a weather normalization clause as protection against severe weather.  

In
addition to weather normalization, starting in September 2009, the Gas Company implemented a revenue decoupling mechanism (RDM).
The RDM reconciles actual delivery service revenues to allowed delivery service revenues (which are based on the annual customer
and volume forecasts in the last rate case) for certain residential customers. The Gas Company will refund or surcharge customers
for differences between actual and allowed revenues. The shortfall or excess after the annual reconciliation will be surcharged
or refunded to customers over a twelve month period starting September 1 st  each year. Pike does not have a revenue
decoupling mechanism as part of their rate structure.  

Gas
purchases are recorded on readings of suppliers  meters as of the end of each month. The Gas Company s and
Pike s rate tariffs include a Gas Adjustment Clause ( GAC ) or Gas Rate Clause ( GRC ) which
adjusts rates to reflect changes in gas costs from levels established in the rate setting process. In order to match such
costs and revenue, the NYPSC and PAPUC have provided for an annual reconciliation of recoverable GAC and GRC costs with
applicable revenue billed. Any excess or deficiency in GAC and GRC revenue  billed is deferred and the balance at the
reconciliation date is either refunded to or recovered from customers over a subsequent twelve-month period. 

As
part of its rate structure for electric sales, Pike is required to file quarterly a Statement of Default Services Charges. The
Default Service Charges are separated into two components: (1) the Market Price of Electric Supply which is based on the forecast
of electric supply costs applied to service classification-specific factors to reflect each service classification s load
characteristics, forecast sales and applicable losses, and (2) an Electric Supply Adjustment Charge to reconcile differences between
default service revenues and costs. The new electric rates go into effect on the first day of the month after the filing is accepted.  

(n)
Federal Income Tax    

The
Company uses the asset and liability method to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between
the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Holding Company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected
to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. In addition, such deferred tax assets and liabilities will be adjusted
for the effects of enacted changes in tax laws and rates.  

(o)
Revenue Taxes   

The
Gas Company collects state revenue taxes on residential delivery rates. The amount included in Revenue and Taxes other than Federal
Income Taxes was $158,893 and $175,294 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pike collects state revenue taxes on residential electric
delivery rates. The amounts included in the financial statements were immaterial for one month of activity.  

   (p)
Stock Based Compensation   

  The
Holding Company accounts for stock based awards in accordance with FASB ASC 718. The Holding Company awards restricted shares
as compensation to our directors.  The shares awarded become unrestricted upon a director leaving the board.  Directors
who also serve as officers of Corning Gas are not compensated for their service as directors. Since these shares are restricted,
in recording compensation expense, the expense incurred is 25% less than the closing price of the stock on the day the stock was
awarded. Each director is awarded 375 shares for each quarter served.  

(q)
Earnings Per Share   

Basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing income available for common stock (net income less dividends declared on Series B
Preferred Stock) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock.  

For
the fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the net additional common stock equivalents had a $0.02 and $0.00 per share effect on the calculation
of the dilutive earnings per share. The net income and average shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted earnings per
share for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015are as follows:  

(r)
311 Transportation Agreement /Compressor Station   

On
January 11, 2010, the Gas Company entered into a contract (311 Transportation Agreement) with a local gas producer that
provided for the building of a compressor station as well as the transfer of a 6  pipeline owned by the gas producer to
the Company for nominal consideration. The contract also sets forth the terms, rates and condition of the transport of the
local producer gas to the interstate pipeline system. On May 21, 2010, the 311 Transportation Agreement was revised to
reflect a change in the projected gas delivery schedule and delivery volumes. The previously agreed to transportation rates
did not change. The contract s maximum daily delivery quantity remained the same. The schedule for attaining the
maximum daily delivery quantity was altered to accommodate the project s construction schedule. The Gas Company bought
the $11 million compressor station and $2.1 million pipeline from the local producer for two dollars. The local producer has
the right to repurchase these facilities for two dollars in ten years. This transaction became effective on May 12, 2011,
when the station began operations. Although the Gas Company has plant available for use that had an original cost of $13.1
million, only two dollars was recognized in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts (313.2) which states that in the
case of gas plant contributed to the utility, gas plant accounts shall be charged only with such expenses, if any, incurred
by the utility.  

(s)
Collective Bargaining Agreement   

The
Company had 59 employees as of September 30, 2016, and 58 as of September 30, 2015. Of this total, nearly half are members of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 139 labor union working under an agreement effective until April 2,
2018.  

(t)
Leatherstocking Companies   

The
Holding Company has a 50% investment in Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC ( Leatherstocking Gas ) and
Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC ( Leatherstocking Pipeline ). The investment and equity in both companies
(collectively,  Joint Ventures ) has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Holding
Company has accounted for its equity investment using the  equity method of accounting based on the guidelines
established in FASB ASC 323. In applying the guidance of FASB ASC 323, the Holding Company recognized the investment in the
Joint Ventures as an asset at cost. The investment will fluctuate in future periods based on the Holding Company s
allocable share of earnings or losses from the Joint Ventures which is recognized through earnings. 

(u)
Business Combination    

The
Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. Under the acquisition method, the underlying tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.
The Company uses a valuation hierarchy, as further described in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to determine the fair values.
Fair Value is subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Administration
costs to acquire a business may include, but are not limited to, fees for accounting, legal and valuation services and are expensed
as incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In the case of the acquisition of Pike, many factors contributed
to a bargain purchase. O   R primarily operates in New York and New Jersey, and having an operation in Pennsylvania created
numerous additional operating costs given its differing jurisdiction. Additionally, Pike represented approximately 6,000 customers
as compared to O   R s overall customer base of over 100,000. Thus, the incremental operating costs were not economically
viable for O   R. Another factor contributing to the bargain purchase is that the market for utility companies the size of
Pike is relatively small, which resulted in a limited number of bidders.  

(v)
Preferred Stock and Temporary Equity   

This
is a new accounting policy effective for fiscal 2016. The Holding Company classifies conditionally redeemable convertible preferred
shares, which includes preferred shares subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within control
of the Holding Company, as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet, in accordance with the guidance enumerated
in FASB ASC No. 480-10  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Company also analyzes the embedded conversion feature
for bifurcation, based on whether the host instrument has more equity-like or debt-like characteristics. Dividends are recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings and issuance costs reduce the initial proceeds and then accreted over the life of the instrument
to the redemption amount.  

The
Holding Company records mandatorily redeemable stock as a liability in accordance with ASC 480. Dividends are recorded as interest
expense and issuance costs are treated the same way as debt issuance costs.  

(w)
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts
with customers. The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for
the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. The updated guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition
guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the updated standard will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new guidance requires that
debt issuance costs related to a note be presented as a direct deduction from that note. This guidance is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The debt issuance
costs will be reclassified to liabilities on the balance sheet. The amount as of September 30, 2016 is $412,316.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance simplifying inventory measurement by requiring companies to value inventory
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe this guidance will have a material effect
on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.  

In
September 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition by the acquiring entity of adjustment to provisional
amounts during the measurement period. The new guidance requires the adjustments that are identified to be recognized in the same
period s financial statements in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The entity must also present separately on
the face of the income statement, or disclose separately in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in the current-period
earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous periods if the adjustment had been identified as of the acquisition
date. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. We are still evaluating whether this guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements when adopted.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The new guidance requires for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that
request in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This
guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted. We are still evaluating whether this guidance will have a material effect
on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on investments that qualify for use of the equity method of accounting. The
new guidance eliminates the need for retroactive adjustments when qualifying for the equity method. This guidance is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
We do not believe this guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance regarding share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequence, classification
of awards and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are still evaluating whether this guidance
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.  

Early
Adoption of New Accounting Guidance    

In
November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that
all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early application is permitted. When the guidance is effective all deferred tax assets and liabilities will be presented
as noncurrent. We have chosen to apply the guidance retroactively. As a result, as of September 30, 2015, we have reclassified
a deferred tax liability of $385,973 from short-term to long-term. As of September 30, 2016, we have reclassified a deferred tax
liability of $471,764 from short-term to long-term.  

(2)
Major Customers    

The
Gas Company has four major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric   Gas, Bath Electric, Gas   Water
Systems, and Repsol Energy North America ( Repsol , formerly Talisman Energy USA Incorporated). Although Repsol is
a significant customer, the Gas Company does not deliver gas to Repsol. Rather the Gas Company receives gas from several of Repsol s
gathering systems and wells, and transports its gas through our system. Although no customer represents at least 10% of our total
revenue, the loss of any of these customers could have a significant impact on the Company s financial results.  

(3)
Property, Plant and Equipment   

The
following table summarizes fixed assets included in utility plant on the Holding Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet at
September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Useful
life for the above assets range from 35 to 55 years for utility plant, 30 to 65 years for poles and line, 66 years for pipeline,
from 45 to 47 years for structures, 50 to 65 years for land rights and 5 to 25 years for all other and corporate fixed assets.
Utility plant includes station equipment, services, meters, regulators including all costs to install those assets. Poles and
line include poles, line and conductors. Total mains installed are represented in pipeline. Structures include both regulator
station buildings and office and operations buildings. All other plant includes all general plant except for buildings and land
and land rights.   

(4)
Marketable Securities   

A
summary of the marketable securities at September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

The
government and agency bonds have contractual maturity dates between June 30, 2018 and August 15, 2024. The contractual maturity
dates for the corporate bonds are from December 15, 2016 to May 1, 2023.  

(5)
Regulatory Matters    

  Below
is a summary of the Gas Company s regulatory assets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Unrecovered
gas costs arise from an annual reconciliation of certain gas revenue and costs (as described in Note 1) and are recoverable in
customer rates in the year following the reconciliation.  

The
following table summarizes regulatory costs at September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Deferred
rate case costs are costs that were incurred in prior rate cases that are amortized over a period determined by the NYPSC or PAPUC
in the current rate case and are recoverable over that period. Deferred rate case reconciliations result from target reconciliations
set up in the current rate case and recovery will be determined by the NYPSC and PAPUC either through Delivery Rate Adjustment
or the next rate case.  

In
fiscal year 2015 the Gas Company determined that it met the criteria to record the minimum pension liability as a regulatory asset
in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-5. As a result of this change in estimate, amounts previously recorded as Accumulated OCI, net
of tax have been recorded as regulatory assets in the current year in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-8, as well as a related deferred
tax liability. The amount of the regulatory asset was $6,297,895 and $4,517,673 as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively. The increase to OCI was $2,748,238 for the year ended September 30, 2015. For periods after the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2015, there will be no change to OCI because of the change. Factors considered included: (1) consistent recovery
of the pension costs on an accrual basis historically and in the current rate case, (2) no indication of expected changes to recovery,
and (3) the existence of a reconciliation process to track the recovery of these costs. For these reasons management determined
the Gas Company met the criteria as set forth in ASC 980-725-25-5.  

Also
included in pension costs and post-retirement benefits is approximately $116,000 and ($35,000) for 2016 and 2015, respectively,
for regulatory assets and (liabilities) related to pension and post-retirement costs. These amounts include both amounts approved
to be amortized in the previous rate case and amounts being accumulated for the next rate case. Included in other in deferred
credits and other is $372,329 and $1,388,049 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for deferred rate case reconciliations.  

Although
the Company expects to recover the cost of its regulatory assets, it does not earn a return on them. The Company expects that
regulatory assets other than deferred unrecovered gas costs and deferred pension costs related to minimum pension liability will
be fully recoverable from customers by the end of its next rate case.

Long-term Debt    

Long-term
debt, including the current portion, was as follows at September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the five years subsequent to September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

On
January 27, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company ( M T ) in the amount
of $17.4 million to consolidate all previous term debt into one loan. As collateral, the Gas Company granted M T a security
interest in all utility property, including plant and equipment, contract rights, easements and rights of way of the Gas Company.
The agreement includes the following covenants to be measured quarterly: (i) maintain a ratio of total funded debt to EBITDA (earnings
before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortizations) of not greater than 3.75 to 1.0 and (ii) maintain cash flow coverage
of not less than 1.1 to 1.0 based on the Company s trailing twelve month operating performance and fiscal operating statements.
The interest rate is a variable rate determined by the Gas Company s funded debt to EBITDA ratio calculated ninety days
after the end of each quarter added to the daily LIBOR rate. Until the first rate adjustment on March 31, 2016, the rate was 2.4%.
On April 1, 2016 the rate continued at 2.4% and was 3.2% at September 30, 2016. This note will be due as interest only for the
first year. In February 2017, the first of fifty-nine equal monthly principal payments of $207,143 along with the variable accrued
interest will be due. In the sixtieth month there will be a final payment due equal to all outstanding principal and interest.
Only the difference between the amount of the note and the long term debt refinanced by the note has been recognized as a cash
item on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The Gas Company will owe a pre-payment penalty on payment of unpaid principal
made in advance of the maturity date and must give at least a three day notice prior to the payment.  

Also
on January 27, 2016, the Gas Company entered into an agreement with M T in the amount of $4.2 million for a multiple disbursement
note to refinance seventy percent of the NYPSC mandated 2015 construction projects with no additional collateral pledged. All
amounts have been borrowed as of March 31, 2016. A NYPSC capital expenditure tracker report was required to receive any advances
on this note. Interest will be a variable rate determined by the Gas Company s funded debt to EBITDA ratio calculated ninety
days after the end of each quarter added to the daily LIBOR rate. Until the first rate adjustment on March 31, 2016, the rate
was 2.4%. This rate continued at April 1, 2016 and was 3.2% at September 30, 2016. Interest only will be due for the first twelve
months then will convert to a term loan payable in forty-seven equal payments based on a seven year amortization schedule with
a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest due. Since this note replaced a $4.2 million short term note, it has
not been recognized as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The Gas Company will owe a pre-payment
penalty on payment of unpaid principal made in advance of the maturity date and must give at least a three day notice prior to
the payment.  

The
Gas Company entered into an additional $4.2 million Multiple Disbursement Term Note with M T Bank on August 31, 2016 which
permits draws from time to time in accordance with its terms until December 31, 2016 at which time amounts outstanding under the
note will be payable in 56 monthly installments of principal, based on a 7-year amortization schedule, with all unpaid principal
and interest payable in full on August 31, 2021. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the note is based on a spread over
LIBOR which varies from 1.9% to 2.8% based on the ratio of the Gas Company s total funded debt to EBITDA (the  Leverage
Ratio ) with the spread set at 3.1% until September 30, 2016. If the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 2.0, the interest
rate is LIBOR plus 1.9%; if the Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.0 but less than or equal to 2.5, the interest rate is LIBOR plus
2.2%; if the Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.5 but less than or equal to 3.0, the interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.5%; and if the
Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.0, the interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.8%. The obligations of the Gas Company to M T Bank are
secured under an additional general security agreement covering the Gas Company s tangible and intangible rights in its
gas distribution system, personal property and other assets. The Gas Company will owe a pre-payment penalty on payment of unpaid
principal made in advance of the maturity date and must give at least a three day notice prior to the payment. The first draw
on this note was $3.0 million on October 5, 2016.  

On
August 31, 2016, the Holding Company s newly acquired, wholly-owned subsidiary Pike had outstanding $3.2 million in outstanding
First Mortgage Bonds, 7.07% Series C Due 2018 (the  Pike Bonds ) issued pursuant to the Indenture of Mortgage and
Deed of Trust, between Pike and Deutsche Bank as trustee (as successor to Bankers Trust Company) (the  Trustee ),
as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 15, 1990 and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of

each April and October and the principal amount of $3.2 million is due and payable on October 1, 2018. The Holding Company has
caused Pike to call the Pike Bonds for redemption as of October 2, 2016, at the 100.372% of outstanding principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Substantially all of the real property and tangible personal property of Pike
is subject to the lien of the Indenture. The Indenture contains various covenants of Pike, including maintaining the assets of
Pike which are secured under the Indenture free of other liens subject to certain  Permitted Encumbrances  and other
liens, including liens expressly junior to the lien of the Indenture. Other covenants in the Indenture include obligations of
Pike to pay taxes, maintain and repair its properties, maintain insurance, and to not pay dividends or make repurchases or distributions
on its common stock except from its  Net Income  as defined in the Indenture plus $105,000 subject to certain exceptions.
In addition, Pike covenants in the Indenture not to sell or lease its property, pay management fees to its parent entity, or create
funded debt, in each case subject to exceptions. The Pike Bonds were repaid on October 3, 2016.  

On
August 31, 2016, Pike entered into a Credit Agreement with M T Bank in the amount of $12.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains
various affirmative and negative covenants of Pike including, (i) a total funded debt to tangible net worth ratio of not greater
than 1.4 to 1.0, (ii) a total funded debt to EBITDA ratio of not greater than 3.75 to 1.0, and (iii) a minimum cash flow overage
of not less than 1.1 to 1.0, with each of the financial covenants measured quarterly based on Pike s trailing twelve month
operating performance and fiscal quarterly financial statements commencing with the period ended September 30, 2017; compliance,
accounting, and financial statement requirements, and prohibitions on changes in management or control, any sale of all or substantially
all of its assets, acquisitions of substantially all the asset of any other entity, or other material changes to its business,
purposes, structure or operations which could materially adversely affect Pike. The note bears interest at 3.0% above one month
LIBOR, adjusting daily, payable monthly commencing September 30, 2016. Principal on the note is payable commencing March 31, 2017
(after six-months of interest only payments), with 53 consecutive monthly payments of $100,000 each due on the last day of each
month, with the unpaid principal and any unpaid interest due and payable in full on August 31, 2021. The proceeds of the note
were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of its capital stock purchase of Pike. Pike will owe a pre-payment penalty on
payment of unpaid principal made in advance of the maturity date and must give at least a three day notice prior to the payment.  

The
Gas Company and Pike are in compliance with all of their loan covenants as of September 30, 2016.

October 27, 2015, the Gas Company extended its line of credit agreement with Community Bank N.A. ( Community Bank )
in the amount of $8.5 million that originally was to expire expire on April 1, 2016. Borrowings outstanding on this line were

2,468,961 subscription rights for the purchase of up to 140,000 shares of 6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and up to 360,000
shares of 4.8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Each subscription right entitled the holder to purchase either: (i) one-eighth

of the 4.8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, for $20.75 per share, which is convertible in accordance

available, 105,303 shares were subscribed and of the 360,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock available, 244,263
shares were subscribed. Each shareholder exercising over-subscription rights was able to purchase all of the additional shares

approximately $7.7 million less issuance costs of approximately $225,000 for net proceeds of approximately $7.5 million, of which
approximately $197,000 of the Series A Preferred Stock proceeds was received from the Company s Rabbi Trust investment.  

Series
A Cumulative Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends at a rate of 6.0% of the liquidation preference per share ($25.00) and
are expected to be paid on or about the 14th day of April, July, October and January of each year starting October 14, 2016. The
dates of record for the dividends, if any, will be March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, immediately preceding the
relevant dividend payment date. On September 30, 2023, outstanding shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock will mature and
be redeemed solely in cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share plus an amount equal to all accrued
but unpaid dividends subject to our having funds legally available for redemption under New York law. In the event of a fundamental
change as defined on the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Series A Cumulative Preferred
Stock have the right to redeem their shares at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share plus an amount
equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends prior to the effective date of the fundamental change subject to our having funds legally
available for such redemption under New York law. A fundamental change is generally defined as a change of control of the Holding
Company. The holders of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as specifically required by New
York laws or by the Charter, as amended by the Certificate of Amendment which allows voting rights under specific circumstances.
If dividends on shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for eight or more consecutive dividend
periods, the holders of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class with holders of all other preferred stock of equal rank having similar voting rights, will be entitled at our next special
or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of one additional member of our Board of Directors, subject
to certain limitations.  

The
Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to priority of dividend payments and rights upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up, senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our capital stock issued
in the future, unless the terms of that capital stock expressly provide that it ranks senior to, or on parity with, the Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock; on parity with any class or series of our capital stock, the terms of which expressly provide that
it will rank on parity with the Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, including the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; and junior
to any other class or series of our capital stock, the terms of which expressly provide that it will rank senior to the Series
A Cumulative Preferred Stock, none of which exists on the date hereto, and the issue of which would be subject to the approval
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and all other preferred stock of equal rank having
similar rights voting as a single class; and subject to funds legally available and payment of or provision for our debts and
other liabilities.  

In
accordance with ASC 480, because of the mandatory redemption feature this is treated as liability. The issuance costs of approximately
$75,000 are treated as debt issuance costs and will be amortized over the life of the instrument. Future dividends will be recorded
as interest expense. Dividends will begin to accrue July 1, 2016. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, $40,542 was accrued
for dividends paid on October 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2016.  

Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends at a rate of 4.8% of the liquidation preference per share ($20.75)
and are expected to be paid on or about the 14th day of April, July, October and January of each year commencing October 14, 2016.
The dates of record for the dividends, if any, will be March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, immediately preceding
the relevant dividend payment date. At any time and from time to time after issuance, the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock are convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder into shares of common stock at the rate of one (1) share
of our common stock for each one (1) share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment for standard anti-dilution
adjustments such as stock dividends or stock distributions; subdivisions or combinations of our common stock; and certain tender
or exchange offers by us or one of our subsidiaries for our common stock, in each case subject to certain exceptions. In the event
a holder of shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock elects to convert any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock that would result in such shareholder owning more than 10% of the capital stock of the Gas Company under the provisions
of Section 70 of the New York Public Service Law, that holder would be unable to exercise the conversion right without prior consent
of the NYPSC. The Holding Company will not pay any cash to a holder in respect of such conversion or otherwise settle any such
conversion in cash, other than the right of the holder to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share in exchange therefor.
The NYPSC approved the exercise of conversion rights on any Series B Convertible Preferred Stock by our three existing shareholders
of 10% or more of our common stock.  

On
September 30, 2026, outstanding shares of Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock will mature and be redeemed solely in cash at a
redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends subject
to our having funds legally available under New York law. In the event of a fundamental change as defined on the Certificate of
Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to redeem their
shares at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends
prior to the effective date of the fundamental change subject to our having funds legally available for such redemption under
New York law. A fundamental change is generally defined as a change of control of the Holding Company.  

The
holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as specifically required by New York laws or
by the Holding Company s Charter, as amended by the Certificate of Amendment which allows voting rights under specific circumstances
as described in the Certificate of Amendment. If dividends on shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared
and paid for eight or more consecutive dividend periods, the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series A
Cumulative Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of all other preferred stock of equal rank having similar
voting rights, will be entitled at our next special or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of one
additional member of our Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations.  

The
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to priority of dividend payments and rights upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our capital stock issued
in the future, unless the terms of that capital stock expressly provide that it ranks senior to, or on parity with, the Series
A Cumulative Preferred Stock; on parity with any class or series of our capital stock, the terms of which expressly provide that
it will rank on parity with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, including the Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock; and junior
to any other class or series of our capital stock, the terms of which expressly provide that it will rank senior to the Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which exists on the date of this report, and the issue of which would be subject to the
approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and all other stock of equal rank having
similar rights voting as a single class; and subject to funds legally available and payment of or provision for our debts and
other liabilities.  

In
accordance with ASC 480, Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock is not considered mandatorily redeemable as a result of the conversion
feature presenting a contingency related to the redemption dates. Accordingly, this is not considered a liability. However, as
a result of the decision related to conversion and not reaching redemption resting with the holder, this instrument has been classified
as temporary equity in accordance with ASC 480. Upon conversion, the instrument would be reclassified as permanent equity. Dividends
will be recorded each period in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders  equity and will begin to accrue July
1, 2016. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, $62,776 was accrued for dividends paid on October 15, 2016 to shareholders
of record on September 30, 2016. The Company determined that bifurcation of the embedded conversion option feature was not required.
The issuance costs of approximately $150,000 reduce the initial proceeds and will be accreted until redemption or conversion.

February 2015, Leatherstocking Gas purchased a 1.5 mile high pressure gas main along with a meter, heater and regulator station
for $900,000. This purchase was funded with a new loan agreement with Five Star Bank for $540,000 and investments from the Holding
Company and Mirabito Regulated Industries of $180,000 each. Another $100,000 was invested by both companies for total investments
of $1,130,000 by each for the year ended September 30, 2015. The new note matures on March 1, 2020 with an interest rate of 4.58%.
With this purchase, Leatherstocking Gas began service to a large industrial customer.  

  On
October 19, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas and Five Star Bank entered into an agreement which allowed Leatherstocking Gas to borrow
up to $500,000 as a line-of-credit note with interest only payments to finance the continued and additional infrastructure cost
of the construction project in Northern Pennsylvania. This required an investment of approximately $166,667 from both the Holding
Company and Mirabito Regulated Industries. Leatherstocking Pipeline is a guarantor of this loan. The total of $500,000 had been
drawn on this note as of December 31, 2015 and the required investment was made in previous quarters.  

On
July 11, 2016, Leatherstocking Gas and Five Star Bank entered into an agreement which allows Leatherstocking Gas to borrow up
to $1.25 million as a line-of-credit note with interest only payments to finance the continued and additional infrastructure cost
of the construction project in Northern Pennsylvania. Approximately $613,000 has been drawn on this loan as of September 30, 2016
and required an investment of approximately $204,000 each from the Holding Company and Mirabito Regulated Industries. Leatherstocking
Pipeline is a guarantor of this loan.  

The
interests in Leatherstocking Pipeline, which was formed with the same structure and managers as Leatherstocking Gas, are also
held by the Holding Company. Leatherstocking Pipeline is an unregulated company whose purpose is to serve one customer in Lawton,
Pennsylvania. In the spring and summer of 2012, Leatherstocking Pipeline built and placed in service facilities to serve that
customer.  

The
investment and equity in both Leatherstocking companies (collectively, the  Joint Ventures ) has been recognized in
the consolidated financial statements. The Holding Company has accounted for its equity investment using the equity method of
accounting based on the guidelines established in FASB ASC 323. In applying the guidance of FASB ASC 323, the Holding Company
recognized the investment in the Joint Ventures as an asset at cost. The investment will fluctuate in future periods based on
the Holding Company s allocable share of earnings or losses from the Joint Ventures which is recognized through earnings.  

The
following table represents the Holding Company s investment activity in the Joint Ventures at September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015:  

As
of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, the Joint Ventures had combined assets of $12.6 million, combined liabilities of
$7.5 million and combined net losses of approximately $119,000. As of and for the year ended September 30, 2015, the Joint Ventures
had combined assets of $11.9 million, combined liabilities of $7.3 million and combined net losses of approximately $235,000.  

(11)
Income Taxes   

Income
tax expense for the years ended September 30 is as follows:  

Actual
income tax expense differs from the expected tax expense (computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of 34%), as follows:  

Regulatory
deferred tax adjustment represents the deferred tax on the leak survey and repair costs petition that the Gas Company
filed in April, 2016 with the New York Public Service Commission. In that petition the Gas Company is requesting recovery of
the $349,547 and the associated income tax effects. The gain on the bargain purchase adjustment with respect to the
acquisition of Pike is included in net income and is not taxable so was presented as an offset to income.  

The
tax effects of temporary differences that result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities at September 30 are as follows:  

The
Holding Company has federal and New York State tax net operating loss carry forwards available of approximately $6.4 million as
of September 30, 2016 that begin to expire at the end of the Holding Company s fiscal 2025 tax year.  

  The
accounting rules for uncertain taxes provide for the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on
a tax return should be recognized in the financial statements. The Holding Company has evaluated its tax positions and accordingly
has not identified any significant uncertain tax positions. The Holding Company s policy is to classify interest associated
with uncertain tax positions as interest expense in the financial statements. Penalties are classified under other expense. The
Holding Company will file a consolidated federal income tax return and the Gas Company and Pike will file separate state income
tax returns in New York and Pennsylvania. The federal returns for the tax years ended September 30, 2013 and prior to September
30, 2012 are no longer subject to examination. The state returns for the tax years ended prior to September 30, 2013 are no longer
subject to examination.  

(12)
Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Plans    

There
are currently three covered participants related to the deferred compensation obligation that are all former officers. The
liability on the consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the future obligation. In 1997, the Gas Company
established a trust (the Rabbi Trust) to fund a deferred compensation plan for certain officers. The fair market value of
assets in the trust was $2,168,913 (plus $51,185 in additional stock)  and $2,102,600 (plus $51,185 in additional
stock) at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the plan liability, which is labeled as deferred compensation on the
balance sheet, was $1,453,782 and $1,492,488 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The assets of the trust are
available to general creditors in the event of insolvency. In 2016, the mortality assumption were based on the 2008 VBT
Primary Male Smoker tables with generational improvements using scale MP-2016 for two of the covered participants which
resulted in a decrease in the liabilities of approximately $24,784. In 2015, the mortality assumption was changed from the
RP-2000 annuitant/non-annuitant mortality table with generational improvements using scale BB to the 2008 VBT Primary Male
Smoker tables with generational improvements using scale MP-2015 for the same two covered participants which resulted in a
decrease to the pension obligation of approximately $171,000. 

The
Gas Company has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees. The benefits are based on years of
service and the employee s highest average compensation during a specified period. The Gas Company makes annual contributions
to the plans equal to amounts determined in accordance with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Security Act of
1974. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed for service to date, and those expected to be earned in the
future.  

In
addition to the Gas Company s defined benefit pension plans, the Gas Company offers post-retirement benefits comprised of
medical and life coverage to its employees who meet certain age and service criteria. For union participants who retire on or
after September 2, 1992, the Gas Company cost for post-retirement benefits is contractually limited and will not exceed $150 per
month. This contract is in effect until April 2, 2018. The monthly benefit for all non-union employees, who retire between the
ages of 62 and 65, will be the lesser of 40% of the retiree s plan premium or $150. After age 65, the Gas Company pays up
to $150 a month for the cost of the retiree s supplemental plan. In addition, the Gas Company offers limited life insurance
coverage to active employees and retirees. The post-retirement benefit plan is not funded. The Gas Company accrues the cost of
providing post-retirement benefits during the active service period of the employee.  

The
following table shows reconciliations of the Gas Company s pension and post-retirement plan benefits as of September 30:  

The
funded status of both plans totaling a deficiency of approximately $8,600,000 and $6,800,000 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
are included in deferred pension   post-retirement benefits on the consolidated balance sheets, which are offset by a pension
regulatory asset of approximately $116,000 at September 2016 and a pension regulatory liability of approximately $35,000 at September
30, 2015. In accordance with ASC 715, the net actuarial loss/(gain) and unrecognized prior service cost are collectively adjusted
through other comprehensive income (loss)-minimum pension liability and included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
the consolidated financial statements, which are presented net of tax for fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the
Gas Company determined that it meets the criteria to record these items as a regulatory asset in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-5.
See Note 5 to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  

During
the year ended September 30, 2015, the pre-tax accumulated net actuarial loss/(gain) and unrecognized prior service cost increased
by $851,547 from $3,666,126 to $4,517,673. Historically, the change in these items had been recorded net of tax in the consolidated
statements of changes in stockholders  equity. During first three quarters of the year ended September 30, 2015, the Gas
Company recorded $222,363 ($377,526, net of tax) through OCI for the estimated change in these items based on estimates prepared
by the actuary during the year ended September 30, 2014. After removing these items from OCI and establishing the regulated asset
in the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2015, the remaining change of $474,021 was recorded directly as an increase
to this asset. Beginning with the year ended September 30, 2016 the change in pre-tax net actuarial loss/(gain) and unrecognized
prior service was recorded directly to the regulatory asset related to pension.  

Amortization
of unrecognized net (gain)/loss for the Retirement Plan for fiscal year ending September 30, 2016:  

Amortization
of unrecognized net (gain)/loss for the Post-Retirement Plan for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016:  

For
ratemaking and financial statement purposes, pension expense represents the amount approved by the NYPSC in the Gas Company s
most recently approved rate case. Pension expense (benefit) for ratemaking and financial statement purposes was approximately
$970,000 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The difference between the pension expense (benefit) for ratemaking
and financial statement purposes, and the amount computed above has been deferred as regulatory assets and are not included in
the prepaid pension cost noted above. The cumulative amounts deferred equal $264,693 and $89,746 as of September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  

The
NYPSC has allowed the Gas Company to recover incremental cost associated with post-retirement benefits through rates on a current
basis. Due to the timing differences between the Company s rate case filings and financial reporting period, a regulatory
receivable of $103,066 and $123,174 has been recognized at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

For
the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the discount rate was prepared by utilizing an analysis of the plan s
expected future cash flows and high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the
period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used is an estimate of the rate at which a defined benefit pension
plan could settle its obligations. Rather than using a rate and curve developed using a bond portfolio, this method selects individual
bonds to match to the expected cash flows of the Plan. Management feels this provides a more accurate depiction of the true cost
to the Plan to settle the obligations as the Plan could theoretically go into the marketplace and purchase the specific bonds
used in the analysis in order to settle the obligations of the Plan. In 2015, the mortality assumption used is the RP-200 annuitant/non-annuitant
Mortality Table for Males and Females with generational improvements projected using scale BB. In 2016, the mortality assumption
was changed to the sex-distinct RP-2014 Mortality Tables with improvements projected using Scale MP-2016 on a fully generational
basis. This change reduced the benefit obligation by approximately $350,000. The change in discount rate from 5.22% to 4.20% increased
the benefit obligation by approximately $2.5 million.  

The
expected returns on plan assets of the Retirement Plan and Post-Retirement Plan are applied to the market-related value of plan
assets of the respective plans. For the Retirement Plan, the market-related value of assets recognizes the performance of its
portfolio over five years and reduces the effects of short-term market fluctuations. The Gas Company s Retirement Plan assets
are invested by a manager that reports at least annually to the Gas Company s Investment Committee for review and evaluation.
The manager has been given the objective to achieve modest capital appreciation with a secondary objective of achieving a relatively
high level of current income using a mix of cash equivalents, fixed income securities and equities to structure a balanced investment
portfolio. The Investment Committee does not reserve control over investment decisions, with the exception of certain limitations,
and holds the manager responsible and accountable to achieve the stated objectives. The market-related value of Post-Retirement
Plan assets is set equal to market value.  

For
measurement purposes, a 6% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (health care cost trend rate)
was assumed for 2016. The rate is assumed to increase by 6% each year thereafter. A 1% increase in the actual health care
cost trend would result in approximately a 3.9%  increase in the service and interest cost components of the annual net
periodic post-retirement benefit cost and a 5.7% increase in the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. A 1%
decrease in the actual health care cost trend would result in approximately a 3.2% decrease in the service and interest cost
components of the annual net periodic post-retirement benefit cost and a 4.8% decrease in the accumulated post-retirement
benefit obligation. 

The
Gas Company expects to contribute $1,183,628 to the Retirement Plan during the year ended September 30, 2017.  

The
Gas Company also maintains the Corning Natural Gas Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the  Savings Plan ). All employees
of the Gas Company who work for more than 1,000 hours per year and who have completed one year of service may enroll in the Savings
Plan at the beginning of each calendar quarter. Under the Savings Plan, participants may contribute up to 50% of their wages.
For all employees, the Gas Company will match one-half of the participant s contribution up to a total of 50% of the participant s
contribution up to a total of 6% of the participant s wages. The plan is subject to the federal limitation. The Gas Company
contribution to the plan was $87,595 in 2016 and $87,456 in 2015.

Acquisition of Pike County Light   Power Company   

As
previously reported, on October 13, 2015, the Holding Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with O R for the purchase
of all of the outstanding capital stock of Pike, a Pennsylvania corporation operating as a regulated electric and gas utility
serving approximately 5,800 customers in Pike County, Pennsylvania. The purchase price for the stock of Pike was $13.1 million,
with an initial closing date working capital adjustment of $2.5 million which was adjusted to $1.97 million for the final working
capital adjustment, subsequent to year end, and the approximately $530,000 is included in Acquisition receivable on the consolidated
balance sheet and assumption of $3.2 million in Pike s outstanding bonds and closed on August 31, 2016. In addition, O R
agreed to provide transition assistance pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement ( TSA ), and to continue to supply
electric power and gas to Pike County pursuant to Electric and Gas Supply Agreements ( ESA  and  GSA ).
The Gas and Electric Supply Agreements are each for a term of 36 months, with up to three 12-month renewal terms.  

The
acquisition of Pike was financed in part by financing from M T Bank, including a $12 million term loan, a $2 million line
of credit, one or more letters of credit with a limit of up to $2.5 million and an initial amount of $2.1 million, issued to O R
as collateral security for the obligations of Pike under the TSA, the GSA and the ESA. The debt is guaranteed by Corning Holding.
There also was $3,616,924 paid in cash. Immediately after the closing, Corning Holding caused Pike to issue a notice of redemption
to the holders of its $3.2 million in bonds, to repurchase the bonds at 100.372% of their principal amount effective October 2,
2016.  

  The
consolidated balance sheet reflects the identification by the Company of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities acquired. The excess of net value over the purchase price was recorded as other income in fiscal 2016 as
a bargain purchase of $1,306,007. The current receivable of approximately $725,000 recognized as  Acquisition receivable 
on the consolidated balance sheet, is mainly attributable to a working capital adjustment of approximately $530,000 that was received
by Pike in October 2016 and additional cash payment from the acquisition not received until October 2016. The trade name valued
at $311,000, the acquired intangible assets, will be amortized over five years and is included in  Other assets  on
the consolidated balance sheet. The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:  

The
business combination was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.
As an acquirer for accounting purposes, the Company has estimated the fair value of Pike s assets and liabilities assumed
and ensured that the accounting policies of Pike were consistent with that of the Company. ASC requires that when fair value of
the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, resulting in a bargain purchase of assets, the acquirer must reassess the
reasonableness of the values assigned to all of the net assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration transferred. The
Company performed such assessment and concluded that the values assigned for the acquisition were reasonable. In the case of the
acquisition of Pike, many factors contributed to a bargain purchase. O   R primarily operates in New York and New Jersey,
and having an operation in Pennsylvania created numerous additional operating costs given its differing jurisdiction. Additionally,
Pike represented approximately 6,000 customers as compared to O   R s overall customer base of over 100,000. Thus, the
incremental operating costs were not economically viable for O   R. Another factor contributing to the bargain purchase is
that the market for utility companies the size of Pike is relatively small, which resulted in a limited number of bidders. The
bargain purchase gain will reduce the tax basis of the assets acquired, resulting in a deferred tax liability of $964,143 in connection
with the acquisition accounting.  

Pro
forma unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 give
effect as if the acquisition occurred on October 1 of the respective year:  

The
combined proforma financial information does not reflect the realization of any expected cost savings or other synergies from
the acquisition of Pike as a result of restructuring activities, other cost savings initiatives or sales synergies following the
completion of the business combination.  

(14)
Segment Reporting   

  The
Company s reportable segments have been determined based upon the nature of the products and services offered, customer
base, availability of discrete internal financial information, homogeneity of products, delivery channel and other factors.  

  The
Corning Natural Gas Corporation (the  Gas Company ) is a gas distribution company providing gas on a commodity and
transportation basis to its customers in the Southern Tier of New York State. Pike County Light   Power Company ( Pike )
provides electricity and natural gas to Pike County, Pennsylvania. The Holding Company is the parent company of all subsidiaries
and has a 50% ownership in the Leatherstocking joint ventures. Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation s (the  Appliance
Company ) information is presented with the Holding Company as it is has little activity.  

  The
following table reflects the results of the segments consistent with the Holding Company s internal financial reporting
process. The following results are used in part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources
to, each of the segments.  

(1)    This
                                         is a one-time transaction resulting from the acquisition of Pike.    

  Prior
to the acquisition of Pike County Light   Power Company, Management viewed the Company as one segment.  

(15)
Stock Options   

A
summary of all stock option activity and information related to all options outstanding follows:  

There
is no unrecognized cost related to options at September 30, 2016 because all options have fully vested.  

(16)
Commitments    

The
Gas Company is a local distribution company and has contracted for gas supply from various sources to provide the commodity to
the city gates. The city gate is the transfer point at which we take ownership of the gas supply from local producers and interstate
pipelines and billing metering starts. The Gas Company maintains storage capacity of approximately 736,000 Dekatherms. Prior to
April 2014, the Gas Company contracted with a third-party to manage its gas supply and storage. Starting in April 2014, the Gas
Company assumed responsibility for managing its gas supply assets. At September 30, 2016, the Gas Company had 565,014 dekatherms
at $903,007 in storage. As the result of these actions, we anticipate that the Gas Company will have sufficient gas to supply
our customers for the 2016-2017 winter heating season. The contract with O R should provide sufficient electricity and natural
gas to supply Pike for the 2016-2017 winter heating and summer cooling.  

The
Gas Company has secured the NYPSC required fixed price and storage gas supply for the winter season and is managing its gas storage
and gas contracts to assure that the Gas Company follows its gas supply and acquisition plan. The gas supply plan is a formal
document that defines how we acquire natural gas to supply our customers. The plan is submitted to the NYPSC every year and adherence
to the plan is a regulatory mandate. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, both flowing and
storage, will be adequate to serve our approximately 14,800 customers.  

Environmental
Considerations: The Gas Company and Pike are subject to various federal, state and local environments laws and regulations. The
Gas Company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures
and assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. Management is currently putting procedures in place to do the same
at Pike. Management believes the Gas Company and Pike are in compliance with all applicable regulations.  

(17)
Related Party Transactions   

Related
party receivables are expenditures paid on behalf of the Holding Company s joint venture investments. There were costs incurred
in fiscal year 2016 of $67,270 with approximately $9,900 due for shares sold to Leatherstocking Gas for director services. A total
of $420,000 was paid in fiscal year 2016 and we expect repayment on the balance during the year ended September 30, 2017.  

(18)
Subsequent Events    

On
August 31, 2016, the Holding Company s newly acquired, wholly-owned subsidiary Pike had outstanding $3.2 million in outstanding
First Mortgage Bonds, 7.07% Series C Due 2018 (the  Pike Bonds ) issued pursuant to the Indenture of Mortgage and
Deed of Trust, between Pike and Deutsche Bank as trustee (as successor to Bankers Trust Company) (the  Trustee ),
as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 15, 1990 and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
October 1, 1998 (collectively, the  Indenture ). The Pike Bonds were repaid on October 3, 2016.  

The
Gas Company entered into an additional $4.2 million Multiple Disbursement Term Note with M T Bank on August 31, 2016 which
permits draws from time to time in accordance with its terms until December 31, 2016. The first draw on this note was $3.0 million
on October 5, 2016.
