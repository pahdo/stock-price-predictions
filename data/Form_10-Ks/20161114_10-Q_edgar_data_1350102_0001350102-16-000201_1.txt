  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION 
  Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. ( Ascent ) was incorporated on October 18, 2005 from the separation by ITN Energy Systems, Inc. ( ITN ) of its Advanced Photovoltaic Division and all of that division s key personnel and core technologies. ITN, a private company incorporated in 1994, is an incubator dedicated to the development of thin-film, photovoltaic ( PV ), battery, fuel cell and nano technologies. Through its work on research and development contracts for private and governmental entities, ITN developed proprietary processing and manufacturing know-how applicable to PV products generally, and to Copper-Indium-Gallium-diSelenide ( CIGS ) PV products in particular. ITN formed Ascent to commercialize its investment in CIGS PV technologies. In January 2006, in exchange for   5,140   shares of common stock of Ascent, ITN assigned to Ascent certain CIGS PV technologies and trade secrets and granted to Ascent a perpetual, exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to use, in connection with the manufacture, development, marketing and commercialization of CIGS PV to produce solar power, certain of ITN s existing and future proprietary and control technologies that, although non-specific to CIGS PV, Ascent believes will be useful in its production of PV modules for its target markets. Upon receipt of the necessary government approvals and pursuant to novation in early 2007, ITN assigned government-funded research and development contracts to Ascent and also transferred the key personnel working on the contracts to Ascent.  
  Currently, the Company is producing consumer and military oriented portable solar charger and battery products focusing on powering mobile devices, outdoor and military equipment, as well as electronics for emergency preparedness purposes. Products in these markets are priced based on the overall product value proposition rather than a conventional commodity-style pricing like most solar panels on a per watt basis. The Company continues to develop new consumer products and has adjusted utilization of its equipment to meet near term sales forecasts.  Additionally, the Company also produces ultra-lightweight solar modules for specialty applications, such as space and near-space, fixed-wing UAV's and drone integration and other off-grid applications. 
    
  Reverse Stock Split 
    
  On May 26, 2016, the Company, a Delaware corporation, filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Certificate of Amendment") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock, par value   $0.0001   per share at a ratio of one-for-twenty (the "Reverse Stock Split"). The Certificate of Amendment did not change the number of authorized shares, or the par value, of the Company s common stock. The Certificate of Amendment provides that every twenty shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock. All shares and per share amounts in the condensed financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split. 

NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the accounting records of Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc., Ascent Solar (Asia) Pte. Ltd., and Ascent Solar (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (collectively, "the Company") as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Ascent Solar (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. is wholly owned by Ascent Solar (Asia) Pte. Ltd., which is wholly owned by Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.   
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes typically found in U.S. GAAP audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . These condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The Company s significant accounting policies were described in Note 3 to the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The update will establish a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for virtually all industries in GAAP. ASU 2014-09 will change the amount and timing of revenue and cost recognition, implementation, disclosures and documentation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date.    The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year.  ASU 2014-09 is now effective for the Company in fiscal year 2018. The Company is researching whether the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate, in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide certain disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists. ASU 2014-15 is effective for all entities for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company has not early adopted ASU 2014-15. The Company is researching whether the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11  , Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which states that inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize all leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet as a lease asset or lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease. ASU 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures regarding leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including 1) accounting for income taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, 5) cash flow classification of employee taxes withheld in the form of shares, 6) the practical expedient for estimating the expected term, and 7) intrinsic value. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the implementation of ASU 2016-09 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Reclassifications  : Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial information to conform to the 2016 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the net loss. 

NOTE 4. LIQUIDITY AND CONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  On September 4, 2015, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement between the Company and two accredited investors (the  Accredited Investors ). Pursuant to the note purchase agreement, the Company issued to the Accredited  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

Investors   $1.5 million   original principal amount of secured subordinated convertible notes on September 4, 2015, and an additional   $0.5 million   original principal amount of secured subordinated convertible notes on September 28, 2015.  On April 29, 2016, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements (the  Exchange Agreements ), with the Accredited Investors to cancel the September 2015 Convertible Notes.  Additionally, on April 29, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreements with the Accredited Investors for the private placement of   $2.0 million   of the Company s newly designated Series G Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series G Preferred Stock ).  See Note 10 for further information.  
    
  On November 4, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a private investor (the "Private Investor") to issue   2,800   shares of Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for   $2.8 million  .  See Note 11 for further information. 
    
  On November 10, 2015, the Company and the Private Investor entered into a committed equity line purchase agreement (the "CEL").  Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the CEL purchase agreement, at its option, the Company has the right to sell to the Private Investor, and the Private Investor is obligated to purchase from the Company, up to   $32.2 million   of the Company s common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the   36  -month period commencing on December 18, 2015, the date that the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC.  The remaining availability under the CEL as of   September 30, 2016   is   $29.1 million  .   
    
  Actual sales of shares of common stock to the Private Investor under the CEL purchase agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, our ability to register shares of common stock with the SEC, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. 
    
  As of January 27, 2016, the Company was not able to access the CEL because the Company does not have any registered shares available for use in connection with the CEL purchase agreement.  The Company is in the process of registering an additional   2,400,000   shares for such purpose with the SEC.  If such additional registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and such additional shares become available for use by the Company, the Company s sales of shares pursuant to the CEL purchase agreement during 2016 would be limited to such   2,400,000   shares.  The Company s use of the CEL in 2016 and beyond would require, among other things, the Company to file additional registration statements in the future that cover additional shares and have such registration statements declared effective.  The Company would also need to maintain the effectiveness of such additional registration statements. 
    
  On January 19, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Series F SPA ) with the Private Investor for the sale of   $7 million   of the Company s newly designated Series F   7%   Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series F Preferred Stock ).  See Note 12 for further information. 
    
  On June 9, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Series H SPA ) with the Private Investor for the sale of up to   $2.5 million   of the Company s newly designated Series H   7%   Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series H Preferred Stock ).  However, on July 13, 2016, the Company entered into an exchange agreement to cancel the Series H Preferred Stock.  See Note 13 for further information. 
    
  On July 13, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with the Private Investor for the private placement of up to   $2,080,000   of the Company s   4%   Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the "July 2016 Convertible Notes").  See Note 13 for further information.  
    
  On September 19, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with one accredited investor for the private placement of   $1,350,000   of the Company s newly designated Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series J Preferred Stock ).  See Note 15 for further information. 
    
  The Company has continued PV production at its manufacturing facility. The Company does not expect that sales revenue and cash flows will be sufficient to support operations and cash requirements until it has fully implemented its new consumer products strategy. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company used   $13.6 million   in cash for operations. The Company's primary significant long term cash obligation consists of a note payable of   $5.6 million   to a financial institution secured by a mortgage on its headquarters and manufacturing building in Thornton, Colorado. Total payments of   $0.3 million  , including principal and interest, will come due in the remainder of 2016. The Company also owes   $0.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   related to a litigation settlement reached in April 2014, which is being paid in equal installments over   40   months which began in April 2014.  
    
  Additional projected product revenues are not anticipated to result in a positive cash flow position for the year   2016   overall and, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has negative working capital. As such, cash liquidity sufficient for the year ending  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

December 31, 2016   will require additional financing. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into securities purchase agreements totaling   $1.3 million  . Refer to Note 20 for additional information.    
    
  The Company continues to accelerate sales and marketing efforts related to its consumer and military solar products and specialty PV application strategies through expansion of its sales and distribution channels. The Company has begun activities related to securing additional financing through strategic or financial investors, but there is no assurance the Company will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company's revenues do not increase rapidly, and/or additional financing is not obtained, the Company will be required to significantly curtail operations to reduce costs and/or sell assets. Such actions would likely have an adverse impact on the Company's future operations.  As a result of the Company s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 5. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
  The following table summarizes property, plant and equipment as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company analyzes its long-lived assets for impairment, both individually and as a group, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  
  Depreciation expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $  384,738   and   $1,381,521  , respectively.   Depreciation expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3,106,948   and   $4,212,012  , respectively.  Depreciation expense is recorded under  Depreciation and amortization expense  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

NOTE 6. INVENTORIES 
  Inventories consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

NOTE 7. DEBT 
  On February 8, 2008, the Company acquired a manufacturing and office facility in Thornton, Colorado, for approximately   $5.5 million  . The purchase was financed by a promissory note, deed of trust and construction loan agreement (the  Construction Loan ) with the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority ( CHFA ), which provided the Company borrowing availability of up to   $7.5 million   for the building and building improvements. In 2009, the Construction Loan was converted to a permanent loan pursuant to a Loan Modification Agreement between the Company and CHFA (the  Permanent Loan ). The Permanent Loan, collateralized by the building, has an interest rate of   6.6%   and the principal will be amortized through its term to January 2028.  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

Further, pursuant to certain negative covenants in the Permanent Loan, the Company may not, among other things, without CHFA s prior written consent (which by the terms of the deed of trust is subject to a reasonableness requirement): create or incur additional indebtedness (other than obligations created or incurred in the ordinary course of business); merge or consolidate with any other entity; or make loans or advances to the Company s officers, shareholders, directors or employees. The outstanding balance of the Permanent Loan was   $5,579,268   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , future principal payments on long-term debt are due as follows: 

NOTE 8. MAKE-WHOLE DIVIDEND LIABILITY 
  In June 2013, the Company entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of   8.0%   per annum, with the dividend rate being indexed to the Company's stock price and subject to adjustment. Conversion or redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock within   4 years   of issuance requires the Company pay a make-whole dividend to the holders, whereby dividends for the full   four   year period are to be paid in cash or common stock (valued at   10%   below market price). 
  The Company concluded the make-whole dividends should be characterized as embedded derivatives under ASC 815. The make-whole dividends were expensed at the time of issuance and recorded as "Make-whole dividend liability" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  The fair value of these dividend liabilities, which are indexed to the Company's common stock, must be evaluated at each period end. The fair value measurements rely primarily on Company-specific inputs and the Company s own assumptions. With the absence of observable inputs, the Company determined these recurring fair value measurements reside primarily within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value determination required forecasting stock price volatility, expected average annual return and conversion date. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the make-whole liability decreased   $0.19 million   from the fair value at   December 31, 2015   as a result of the conversion described below.

2015   the total Notes outstanding balance was   $52,520   and there was a corresponding embedded derivative liability valued at   $60,984  .   
    
  The Investor had available to them a new conversion price beginning on November 4, 2015 as a result of the Series E Preferred Stock transaction further described in Note 11.

NOTE 10. SEPTEMBER 2015 CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK 
    
  September 2015 Convertible Notes Extinguishment 
    
  On September 4, 2015, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement between the Company and the Accredited Investors. Pursuant to the note purchase agreement, the Company issued to the Accredited Investors   $1.5 million   original principal amount of secured subordinated convertible notes on September 4, 2015, and an additional   $0.5 million   original principal amount of secured subordinated convertible notes on September 28, 2015 (collectively, the  September 2015 Convertible Notes ). The September 2015 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of   8%   per annum.  
    
  All amounts due under the September 2015 Convertible Notes were convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Accredited Investors, into shares of Common Stock at a fixed conversion price, which was subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events, of   $2.40   per share (the  Conversion Price ). The Company, however, was prohibited from issuing shares of Common Stock pursuant to the September 2015 Convertible Notes unless stockholder approval of such issuance of securities was obtained as required by applicable NASDAQ listing rules. The Company received stockholder approval of such share issuances at a special stockholders meeting held on December 18, 2015. This provision resulted in a contingent beneficial conversion feature that was recognized once the contingency was resolved based on its intrinsic value at the commitment date.  Accordingly, a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of   $1.38 million   was recorded as a debt discount on December 18, 2015.  The debt discount was recognized as additional interest expense over the life of the September 2015 Convertible Notes. 
    
  There were no registration rights applicable to the September 2015 Convertible Notes. Accordingly, any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the September 2015 Convertible Notes would be restricted and could only be sold in compliance with Rule 144 or in accordance with another exemption from registration.     
    
  On April 29, 2016, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements (the  Exchange Agreements ) with the Accredited Investors. Under the terms of the Exchange Agreements, the September 2015 Convertible Notes (approximately   $2.10 million   of outstanding principal and accrued interest) were cancelled. In exchange, the Company has issued to the Accredited Investors rights to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock of the Company in accordance with the terms of Rights to Receive Common Stock dated April 29, 2016 (the  April 2016 Rights ). The April 2016 Rights obligate the Company to issue to the holders (without the payment of any additional consideration) an aggregate of approximately   2.10 million   shares of common stock (the "April 2016 Rights Shares").  The number of April 2016 Rights Shares is fixed, and is only subject to customary non-price based ratable adjustments.  The April 2016 Rights are immediately exercisable and expire on April 29, 2021. 
    
  A net loss on extinguishment of   $0.89 million   was recorded to "Change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of the cancellation of the September 2015 Convertible Notes and issuance of the April 2016 Rights.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Accredited Investors exercised their April 2016 Rights to receive and the Company has delivered   1,552,865   shares of common stock. 
    
  Series G Convertible Preferred Stock Financing

     Table of Contents  

On April 29, 2016, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with the Accredited Investors for the private placement of   $2,000,000   of the Company s newly designated Series G Preferred Stock.  The Company issued a total of   500   shares of Series G Preferred Stock to the Accredited Investors in exchange for   $500,000   at closing. The Company sold an additional   1,500   shares of Series G Preferred Stock to the Accredited Investors during the months of May and June 2016, which resulted in additional gross proceeds to the Company of   $1,500,000  . 
    
  On September 21, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the  Certificate of Amendment ) to the Certificate of Designations of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series G Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Certificate of Amendment amends the conversion price at which the Series G Preferred Stock can be converted into shares of common stock. Shares of the Series G Preferred Stock (including the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) were previously convertible at the option of the Accredited Investors into common stock at a fixed conversion price of   $1.00   per share.  As amended, the conversion price is equal to the lowest of (i)   $0.045  , (ii)   70%   of the lowest volume weighted average price of our common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date or (iii)   70%   of the lowest closing bid price of our common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date. 
    
  As a result of the modification to the conversion price discussed above, pursuant to guidance from 470-50,   Subsequent Accounting for Modifications and Exchanges if Extinguishment Accounting is Applied,   the original Series G Preferred Stock was extinguished along with the original beneficial conversion for a gain of   $1,886,000  , which was recorded to "change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilites, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The new Series G Preferred Stock was recorded at fair value of   $3,331,239   as of September 21, 2016. 
    
            Additionally, pursuant to a number of factors outlined in ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , the new conversion option in the Series G Preferred Stock was deemed to include an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and separate accounting. As such, the Company ascertained the value of the conversion option as if separate from the convertible issuance and appropriately recorded that value as a derivative liability. On September 21, 2016, the date of the modification, a derivative liability and a corresponding debt discount in the amount of   $1,262,950   were recorded. The debt discount will be charged to interest expense ratably over the life of the Series G Preferred Stock.     
    
  The derivative liability associated with the Series G Preferred Stock is subject to revaluation on a quarterly basis to reflect the market value change of the embedded conversion option. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company conducted a fair value assessment of the embedded derivative associated with the Series G Preferred Stock.  As a result of the fair value assessment, the Company recorded a   $38,521   gain as "Change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations to properly reflect the fair value of the embedded derivative of   $1,301,471   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The derivative associated with the Series G Preferred Stock approximates management s estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivative liability at   September 30, 2016   based on using a Monte Carlo simulation following a Geometric Brownian Motion with the following assumptions: annual volatility of   76%  , present value discount rate of   12%   and dividend yield of   0%  . 
    
  Holders of the Series G Preferred Stock will be entitled to dividends in the amount of   10%   per annum. One year after issuance, the Company is required to redeem for cash all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series G Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to   $1,000   plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon.  Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions), the Series G Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. 
    
  There are no registration rights applicable to the Series G Preferred Stock. Accordingly, any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series G Preferred Stock are restricted and can only be sold in compliance with Rule 144 or in accordance with another exemption from registration. 
    
  On July 26, 2016, the Accredited Investors (the  Series G Sellers ) entered into Assignment Agreements (the  Assignment Agreements ), with another accredited investor (the  Series G Purchaser ). Under the terms of the Assignment Agreements, the Series G Sellers will sell all   2,000   outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock to the Series G Purchaser in a series of installments occurring during September and October 2016. The purchase price will be   $1,000   per share of Series G Preferred Stock (plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon).

If certain defined default events occur, the conversion price would thereafter be reduced (and only reduced), to equal   70%   of the average of the two lowest VWAPs of the Company's common stock for the   twenty   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date.  The Private Investor had available to them a new conversion price beginning on June 9, 2016 as a result of the Series H Preferred Stock transaction further described in Note 13.

The total gross debt issuance cost incurred by the Company related to the Series E Preferred Stock was   $104,000  .  These debt issuance costs will be recognized as additional interest expense over the life of the Series E Preferred Stock.   
    
  At any time after March 31, 2016, the Private Investor has the option to redeem for cash all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series E Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to   $1,250   plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon.

  The Company classified the Series E Preferred Stock as a liability pursuant to ASC 480 on the closing date due to the structure of the financing agreement, whereby the Company has an unconditional obligation that the Company may settle by issuing a variable number of common shares with a monetary value that is fixed and known at inception.  There are   214   shares of Series E Preferred Stock outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Pursuant to a number of factors outlined in ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , the conversion option in the Series E Preferred Stock was deemed to include an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and separate accounting.

  On January 20, 2016, the Company sold and issued   7,000   shares of Series F Preferred Stock to the Private Investor. The aggregate purchase price of the Series F Preferred was   $7,000,000  . On January 20, 2016, the Private Investor paid   $500,000   to the Company. The remaining   $6,500,000   was paid by the Private Investor to the Company in   14   weekly increments of   $500,000   or   $250,000   beginning January 25, 2016 and ending April 28, 2016. 
    
  Holders of the Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends in the amount of   7%   per annum.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company paid dividends in the amount of   $140,923   on the Series F Preferred Stock, resulting in the issuance of   3,614,791   shares of common stock. 
    
  Shares of the Series F Preferred Stock (including the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock at a fixed conversion price equal to   $5.00   per share. If certain defined default events occur, the conversion price would thereafter be reduced (and only reduced), to equal   70%   of the average of the two lowest VWAPs of our common stock for the   twenty   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date. 
    
  If requested by the Private Investor, the Company will make weekly redemptions of shares of Series F Preferred Stock (including any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon).  If the redemption price is paid by the Company in cash, the number of shares to be redeemed in each weekly increment is   250   shares of Series F Preferred Stock, and the redemption price is a price per share equal to   $1,250   plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon.  The Company has the option to make such redemption payments in shares of common stock provided certain specified equity conditions are satisfied at the time of payment. The number of shares of common stock to be issued would be calculated using a per share price equal to   80%   of the one lowest VWAP of our common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the payment date.  For redemption payments made in shares of common stock, the Company will redeem either (i)   250   shares of Series F Preferred Stock or (ii) such greater number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock (and also including any accrued and unpaid dividends) that would result upon redemption in the issuance of a number of shares of common stock equal to   12%   of the aggregate composite trading volume for the Company s common stock during the preceding calendar week.  
    
  The Private Investor had available to them a new conversion price beginning on June 9, 2016 as a result of the Series H Preferred Stock transaction further described in Note 13.

  Pursuant to a number of factors outlined in ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , the conversion option in the Series F Preferred Stock was deemed to include an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and separate accounting. As such, the Company ascertained the value of the conversion option as if separate from the convertible issuance and appropriately recorded that value as a derivative liability. At closing, a derivative liability and a corresponding debt discount in the amount of   $1,666,000   were recorded. The debt discount will be charged to interest expense ratably over the life of the Series F Preferred Stock.

  All principal and accrued interest on the July 2016 Convertible Notes are convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Private Investor, into shares of Common Stock at a variable conversion price equal to the lowest of (i)   $0.045   (the  Fixed Conversion Price ), (ii)   70%   of the lowest volume weighted average price ( VWAP ) of the Company's common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date or (iii)   70%   of the lowest closing bid price of the Company's common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date. If certain defined triggering events occur, the conversion price would thereafter be reduced (and only reduced), to equal   60%   of the lower of (i) the lowest closing bid price of the Company's common stock for the thirty consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date or (ii) the lowest VWAP of the the Company's common stock for the thirty consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date. In addition, on the 90th day and also on the 180th day from the date of the Note SPA, the Private Investor may reset the Fixed Conversion Price to thereafter be equal to the VWAP of the Common Stock for such day or if such 90th or 180th day is not a trading day, then the VWAP for the immediately preceding trading day.  The Private Investor did not convert any July 2016 Convertible Notes into shares of common stock during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  The July 2016 Convertible Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets. The subsidiaries of the Company have guaranteed the Company s obligations under the July 2016 Convertible Notes. 
    
  Pursuant to a number of factors outlined in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the conversion options in the July 2016 Convertible Notes were deemed to include an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and separate accounting. As such, the Company ascertained the value of the conversion option as if separate from the convertible issuance and appropriately recorded that value as a derivative liability. At closing, a derivative liability and a corresponding debt discount in the amount of   $3,155,390   were recorded. The debt discount will be charged to interest expense ratably over the life of the July 2016 Convertible Notes.           
  The derivative liability associated with the July 2016 Convertible Notes is subject to revaluation on a quarterly basis to reflect the market value change of the embedded conversion option. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company conducted a fair value assessment of the embedded derivative associated with the July 2016 Convertible Notes. As a result of the fair value assessment, the Company recorded a   $(3,088,237)   expense as "Change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, net" in the Statements of Operations to properly reflect the fair value of the embedded derivative of   $6,243,627   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The derivative associated with the July 2016 Convertible Notes approximates management s estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivative liability at   September 30, 2016   based on using a Monte Carlo simulation following a Geometric Brownian Motion with the following assumptions: annual volatility of   73%  , present value discount rate of   12%  , dividend yield of   0%  .

  One year after issuance, the Company is required to redeem for cash all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series I Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to   $1,000   plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon.  The Series I Preferred Stock is classified outside of permanent equity, in mezzanine equity, on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of this redemption feature. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   251   shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding. 
    
  A beneficial conversion feature in the amount of   $285,561   was recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount will be recognized as additional expense over the life of the Series I Preferred Stock. 
    
  Exchange Convertible Notes 
       
  On September 13, 2016, the Series I holder entered into an assignment agreement (the  Assignment Agreement ) with the Private Investor. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, the Private Investor has the option to purchase, from time to time, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock from the Series I holder for cash. 
    
  On September 13, 2016, the Company and the Private Investor also entered into an Exchange Agreement dated September 13, 2016 (the  Exchange Agreement ). Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Private Investor has the right, from time to time, to surrender to the Company for cancellation and exchange any shares of Series I Preferred Stock it acquires pursuant to the Assignment Agreement. Any surrendered shares of Series I Preferred Stock would be exchanged for newly issued convertible promissory notes ( Exchange Convertible Notes ). The principal amount of Exchange Convertible Notes to be issued in exchange shall be equal to (i)   $1,000   for each share of Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for exchange plus (ii) the amount of any dividends accrued and unpaid on such Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for exchange. On September 14, 2016, the Private Investor purchased   75   shares of Series I Preferred Stock from the Series I Preferred Stock holder and exchanged the Series I Preferred Stock shares for   $76,563   of Exchange Convertible Notes, including accrued dividends. 
    
  Unless earlier converted or prepaid, the Exchange Convertible Notes will mature one year after issuance. The Exchange Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%   per annum, subject to increase to   24%   per annum upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default (as described below). Principal and interest on the Exchange Convertible Notes is payable on the maturity date or upon any earlier conversion. Principal and interest are payable in cash or, if specified equity conditions are met, shares of Common Stock. 
    
  The Exchange Convertible Notes contain standard and customary events of default including but not limited to: (i) failure to make payments when due under the Exchange Convertible Notes; and (ii) bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company.

  All principal and accrued interest on the Exchange Convertible Notes are convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Private Investor into shares of common stock at a variable conversion price equal to the lowest of (i) the lowest closing bid price of our common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date or (ii)   70%   of the lowest VWAP of our common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Private Investor exercised its option to convert   $15,000   of Exchange Convertible Notes, resulting in the issuance of   1,470,588   shares of common stock. 
    
  Pursuant to a number of factors outlined in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the conversion options in the Exchange Convertible Notes were deemed to include an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and separate accounting. As such, the Company ascertained the value of the conversion option as if separate from the convertible issuance and appropriately recorded that value as a derivative liability. on September 14, 2016, a derivative liability and a corresponding debt discount in the amount of   $32,814   were recorded. The debt discount will be charged to interest expense ratably over the life of the Exchange Convertible Notes.           
  The derivative liability associated with the Exchange Convertible Notes is subject to revaluation on a quarterly basis to reflect the market value change of the embedded conversion option. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company conducted a fair  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

value assessment of the embedded derivative associated with the Exchange Convertible Notes. As a result of the fair value assessment, the Company recorded a   $(34,944)   gain as "Change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, net" in the Statements of Operations to properly reflect the fair value of the embedded derivative of   $67,758   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The derivative associated with the Exchange Convertible Notes approximates management s estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivative liability at   September 30, 2016   based on using a Monte Carlo simulation following a Geometric Brownian Motion with the following assumptions: annual volatility of   66%  , present value discount rate of   12%  , dividend yield of   0%  .

  The Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the Company if the closing price of the common stock exceeds   $232  , as adjusted, for   20   consecutive trading days, or by the holder at any time. The Company has the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a price of   $8.00   per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, plus the make-whole amount (if applicable). At   September 30, 2016  , the preferred shares were not eligible for conversion to common shares at the option of the Company.

Upon any conversion (whether at the option of the Company or the holder), the holder is entitled to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends and also any make-whole amount (if applicable). See Note 8. Make-Whole Dividend Liability.

  Series D-1 Preferred Stock 
    
  On February 19, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement to issue   2,500   shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock to an investor in exchange for   $2,500,000  .  The proceeds were received on the closing date, February 25, 2015. 
    
  All amounts due under the Series D-1 Preferred Stock were convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the investor into shares of Common Stock at a fixed conversion price, which was subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. The Series D-1 Preferred Stock was convertible into shares of Common Stock at the initial price of   $46.20   per share.  
    
  The investor had the option to convert the Series D-1 Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at a  D-1 Alternate Conversion Price  equal to the lowest of (i)   $46.20   per share or (ii)   85%   of the lowest VWAPs of the Common Stock on any trading day during the   five   consecutive trading day period, including the trading day immediately prior to the date of the applicable conversion date.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , the investor exercised its option to convert   2,500   Preferred Shares, representing a value of   $2,500,000  , at a D-1 Alternate Conversion Price resulting in the issuance of   115,292   Common Shares. 
    
  Holders of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock were entitled to receive dividends in the amount of   7%   per annum, subject to increase to   15%   per annum upon the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default. Dividends on the Series D-1 Preferred Stock were payable monthly in shares of Common Stock or cash, at the Company s option. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company paid dividends in the amount of   $6,944   on the Series D-1 Preferred Stock, resulting in the issuance of   195   shares of common stock.

     Table of Contents  

The Company classified the Series D-1 Preferred Stock as a liability pursuant to ASC 480 on the closing date due to the structure of the financing agreement, whereby the Company had an unconditional obligation that the Company may settle by issuing a variable number of common shares with a monetary value that is fixed and known at inception.  The Series D-1 Preferred Stock was fully converted into shares of common stock as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Pursuant to a number of factors outlined in ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging,   the conversion options in the Series D-1 Preferred Stock were deemed to include an embedded derivative that required bifurcation and separate accounting. As such, the Company ascertained the value of the conversion option as if separate from the convertible issuance and appropriately recorded that value as a derivative liability. At closing, a derivative liability and a corresponding debt discount in the amount of   $3.4 million   were recorded. The debt discount of   $3.4 million   was charged to interest expense.  As of   September 30, 2015  , the value of the derivative liability associated with the Series D-1 Preferred Stock was   $0   as the Series D-1 Preferred Stock was fully converted as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  A net gain of   $2.7 million   was recorded to "Change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   upon extinguishment of the D-1 Preferred Stock liability and the related embedded derivative. 
    
  The derivative associated with the Series D-1 Preferred Stock approximated management s estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivative liability at the closing date based on using a Monte Carlo simulation following a Geometric Brownian Motion with the following assumptions: annual volatility of   45%  , present value discount rate of   12%  , dividend yield of   0%  , and a life of   0.2 years  .

  The Committed Equity Line 
    
  On November 10, 2015, the Company and the Private Investor entered into a committed equity line purchase agreement (the "CEL").  Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the CEL purchase agreement, at its option the Company has the right to sell to the Private Investor, and the Private Investor is obligated to purchase from the Company, up to   $32.2 million   of the Company s common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the   36  -month period commencing on December 18, 2015, the date that the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. 
    
  From time to time, the Company may direct the Private Investor, at its sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase an amount of shares of common stock up to the lesser of (i)   $1,000,000   or (ii)   300%   of the average daily trading volume of the Company s common stock over the preceding   ten   trading day period.  The per share purchase price for shares of common stock to be sold by the Company under the CEL purchase agreement shall be equal to   80%   of the average of the   two   lowest VWAPs of the common stock for the   ten   consecutive trading day period prior to the purchase date.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company directed the Private Investor to purchase   $1.06 million   of common stock  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

which resulted in the issuance of   525,454   shares of common stock.  The remaining availability under the CEL as of   September 30, 2016   was   $29,143,853  .   
    
  Actual sales of shares of common stock to the Private Investor under the CEL purchase agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, our ability to register shares of common stock with the SEC, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. 
    
  As of January 27, 2016, the Company was not able to access the CEL because the Company does not have any registered shares available for use in connection with the CEL purchase agreement.  The Company is in the process of registering an additional   2,400,000   shares for such purpose with the SEC.  If such additional registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and such additional shares become available for use by the Company, the Company s sales of shares pursuant to the CEL purchase agreement during 2016 would be limited to such   2,400,000   shares.  The Company s use of the CEL in 2016 and beyond would require, among other things, the Company to file additional registration statements in the future that cover additional shares and have such registration statements declared effective.  The Company would also need to maintain the effectiveness of such additional registration statements. 
    
  The Company may not direct the Private Investor to purchase shares of common stock more frequently than once each   ten   business days.  The Company s sales of shares of common stock to the Private Investor under the CEL purchase agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial ownership by the Private Investor and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than   9.99%   of the Company s then outstanding shares of common stock. 
    
  As consideration for entering into the CEL purchase agreement, the Company has issued to the Private Investor   132,000   shares of common stock (the  Commitment Shares ).  The Commitment Shares were issued to the Private Investor in   five   increments which commenced upon the date that the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC.    

NOTE 17. EQUITY PLANS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Share-Based Compensation:   The Company measures share-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes this cost as an expense over the grant recipients  requisite service periods for all awards made to employees, officers, directors and consultants. 
  The share-based compensation expense recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:    

The following table presents share-based compensation expense by type: 

Stock Options:   The Company recognized share-based compensation expense for stock options of   $295,000   to officers, directors and employees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to stock option awards ultimately expected to vest. The weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and

     Table of Contents  

2015   was   $1.14   and   $14.40   per share, respectively. Fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes Model with the following assumptions: 

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. Historical data is used to estimate forfeitures within the Company s valuation model. The Company s expected life of stock option awards is derived from historical experience and represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized was   $165,000   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.2   years. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   70,828   shares were vested or expected to vest in the future at a weighted average exercise price of   $46.53  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   182,160   shares remained available for future grants under the Option Plan. 
  Restricted Stock:   In addition to the stock options discussed above, the Company recognized share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants of   $414,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The weighted average estimated fair value of restricted stock grants for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.97   and   $22.20   per share, respectively. 
    
  Total unrecognized share-based compensation expense from unvested restricted stock as of   September 30, 2016   was   $127,000   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   0.3   years. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   82,245   shares were expected to vest in the future. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   490,048   shares remained available for future grants under the Restricted Stock Plan.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance. As a result of many factors, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Overview 
  We are a company formed to commercialize flexible photovoltaic modules using our proprietary technology.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated   $1,418,000   of revenue. Our revenue from product sales was   $1,370,000   and our revenue from government research and development contracts was   $48,000  .  
  Our proprietary manufacturing process deposits multiple layers of materials, including a thin film of highly efficient Copper-Indium-Gallium-diSelenide ( CIGS ) semiconductor material on a flexible, lightweight, high tech plastic substrate using a roll-to-roll manufacturing process and then laser patterns the layers to create interconnected photovoltaic ("PV") cells, or PV modules, in a process known as monolithic integration. We believe that our technology and manufacturing process, which results in a lighter, flexible module package, provides us with unique market opportunities relative to both the crystalline silicon ( c-Si ) based PV manufacturers that currently lead the PV market, as well as other thin film PV manufacturers that use substrate materials such as glass, stainless steel or other metals that can be heavier and more rigid than plastics. 
  We believe that the use of CIGS on a flexible, durable, lightweight, high tech plastic substrate will allow for unique and seamless integration of our PV modules into a variety of electronic products, building materials, defense, transportation and space applications, as well as other products and applications that may emerge. For markets that place a high premium on weight, such as consumer electronics, rooftop, defense, space, near space, and aeronautic markets, we believe our materials provide attractive increases in power-to-weight ratio, and we believe that our materials have higher power-to-area ratios and voltage-to-area ratios than competing flexible PV thin film technologies. We believe that our lightweight, flexible, and ultra-rugged technology is transformational in nature, and will provide us advantages in serving newly emerging specialty markets such as UAV s (unmanned aerial vehicles) as well as BAPV (building applied photovoltaic) and other applications where it is not possible to add solar panels to existing structures using traditional crystalline solar technology. 
    
  In 2012, we transitioned our business model adding a second business focused on developing PV integrated consumer electronics. In June of 2012, we launched our new line of consumer products under the EnerPlex  brand, and introduced our first product, the Surfr  battery and a solar case for the Apple  iPhone  4/4S smart phone featuring our ultra-light CIGS thin film technology integrated directly into the case. The case incorporates our ultra-light and thin PV module into a sleek, protective iPhone 4/4S case, along with a thin, life extending, battery. The charger adds minimal weight and bulk to the iPhone, yet provides supplemental charging when needed.  
  In December 2012, we launched the EnerPlex Kickr  and EnerPlex Jumpr  product series. The Kickr IV is an extremely portable, compact and durable solar charging device, approximately seven inches by seven inches when folded, and weighs less than half a pound. The Kickr IV provides 6.5 watts of regulated power that can help charge phones, digital cameras, and other small USB enabled devices. The Kickr IV is ideal for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking and mountain climbing as well as daily city use. To complement the Kickr IV, we also released the Jumpr  series of portable power banks.  The Jumpr  series provides a compact power storage solution for those who need to take the power of the sun with them on the go.  Throughout 2014, EnerPlex released multiple additions to the Jumpr line of products: including the Jumpr Stack 3,6   9, innovative batteries equipped with tethered micro-USB and Apple Lightning cables and revolutionary Stack   Charge design, enabling batteries to be charged simultaneously when they are placed on top of one another. Also released in 2014 was the Jumpr Slate series; products which push the boundaries of how thin batteries can be, the Jumpr Slate 10k, at less than 7mm thick was the thinnest lithium polymer battery available when it was released. The Jumpr Slate 5k and 5k Lightning each come with a tethered micro-USB and Lightning cable respectively; freeing consumers from worrying about toting extra cables with them while on the move. 
    
  At Outdoor Retailer 2014, EnerPlex debuted the Generatr Series, the Generatr 1200 and Generatr 100 are lithium-ion based large format batteries; lighter and smaller than competitors, the Generatr Series is targeted for consumers who require high-capacity, high-output batteries which remain ultra-portable when compared to the competition. Also debuted at Outdoor Retailer was the Commandr 20, a high output solar charger designed specifically to integrate with and charge the Generatr  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

series, allowing consumers to stay out longer without needing to charge their Generatr batteries from a traditional power source.   
    
  In early January 2016, at the Consumer Electronics Show ("CES"), the Company debuted the Jumpr Fit line of high-performance portable batteries, included in this line were the Jumpr Fit iQ and FX, equipped with Qi compatible wireless charging and Qualcomm certified Quick Charge 2.0 capabilities respectively. Also debuted at CES was the Kickr Mini platform. Based on the previously announced MilPak military platform, the Kickr Mini integrates both power storage and generation into a single turnkey product. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company's newest debuted product, the Kickr 7 FL (Feather-light), received "Best of Show" awards from GearJunkie, The Manual, and New Atlas at the 2016 Outdoor Retailer Show.  Engineered with the Company's revolutionary CIGS technology and a completely redesigned encapsulation process that leverages upon the Company's aerospace and drone product development, the Kickr 7 FL debuted at the 2016 Outdoor Retailer Tradeshow as the world's lightest consumer solar charger.  
    
  Throughout 2013, we aggressively pursued new distribution channels for the EnerPlex  brand; these activities have led to placement in a variety of high-traffic ecommerce venues such as www.walmart.com, www.brookstone.com, www.newegg.com as well as many others including our own e-commerce platform at www.goenerplex.com. The April 2013 placement of EnerPlex products at Fry s Electronics, a US West Coast consumer electronics retailer, represented our first domestic retail presence.  EnerPlex products are carried in all of Fry s 34 stores across 9 states. In 2014 EnerPlex products launched in multiple online and brick-and-mortar partners; including BestBuy.com, 300 premium Verizon Wireless stores via partner The Cellular Connection (TCC) and 25 Micro Center stores across 16 states. In the third quarter of 2015, EnerPlex expanded its presence to 456 total TCC Verizon Wireless Premium retailers, adding 156 stores. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with EVINE Live, one of the premier home shopping networks with TV programming that reaches over 87 million US homes to begin selling EnerPlex products during their broadcasts.  During the second quarter EnerPlex launched the Generatr S100 and select other products exclusively with EVINE, and in the third quarter the Generatr 1200 launched exclusively with EVINE for a limited period. 
    During the second quarter of 2015, EnerPlex launched its products into two world recognized retailers; including over 100 The Sports Authority stores nationwide, in addition to launching in select Cabela s,  The World s Foremost Outfitter , stores and via Cabela s online catalog. Internationally, EnerPlex products became available in the United Kingdom via the brand s launch with 172 Maplin s stores throughout the country.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, EnerPlex launched with GovX, the premier online shopping destination for Military, Law Enforcement and Government agencies.   
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, EnerPlex launched the new Emergency sales vertical, partnering with Emergency Preparedness eCommerce leader, Emergency Essentials. 
    
  We continue to design and manufacture PV integrated consumer electronics, as well as portable power applications for commercial and military users.  Due to the durability enabled by the monolithic integration employed in our technology, the capability to customize modules into different form factors and the industry leading light weight and flexibility provided by our modules, we believe the potential applications for our products are numerous.  
  During 2014, our partner in the United Kingdom, The Solar Cloth Company, won an award in the BIPV category for their use of Ascent Solar s modules in tensioned fabric applications; this application is an example of the high-volume opportunities which Ascent is positioned to take advantage of in the absence of other technologies which can match Ascent s industry leading durability and power-to-weight ratio.  During the second quarter of 2015, Ascent Solar began the supply of solar panels for commercial production of the Silent Falcon Unmanned Aircraft.  Building on the Company's experience in UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicles) the Company announced, in the third quarter of 2015, a partnership with Bye Aerospace to develop a solar powered aircraft for the improved investigation of Mars. 
    
  In early 2016, Ascent announced new breakthroughs in the Company s line of high-voltage solar products, designed specifically for high-altitude and space markets, building on the progress previously announced in Q4, 2015.  Also during the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced the launch of select products on the GSA Advantage website; which allows Federal employees, including members of all branches of the US Military, to directly purchase Ascent and EnerPlex products including: the MilPak E, Commandr 20, Kickr 4 and WaveSol solar modules. 
    
  At the end of the first quarter of 2015, we announced that six EnerPlex products were awarded accolades as Red Dot Design Award winners, recognizing both the aesthetic as well as functional design of the Jumpr Quad, Jumpr Stack 3/6/9, the

     Table of Contents  

Generatr 100 and the Generatr 1200.  During the third quarter of 2015, the Generatr 100 won a Best of Show Award at the CTIA Super Mobility show in Las Vegas.  In 2015, Ascent Solar won its second R D 100 Award. The 2015 award was given for the development of the MilPak platform, a military-grade solar power generation and storage unit. The MilPak platform is the only MIL-STD 810G tested, fully integrated power generation and storage solution available. 
  Commercialization and Manufacturing Strategy 
  Our proprietary manufacturing process deposits multiple layers of materials, including a thin film of highly efficient Copper-Indium-Gallium-diSelenide ( CIGS ) semiconductor material, on a flexible lightweight plastic substrate using a roll-to-roll manufacturing process and then laser patterns the layers to create interconnected PV cells, or PV modules, in a process known as monolithic integration. Our monolithic integration techniques enable us to form complete PV modules with less or no costly back end assembly of intercell connections. Traditional PV manufacturers assemble PV modules by bonding or soldering discrete PV cells together. This manufacturing step typically increases manufacturing costs and at times proves detrimental to the overall yield and reliability of the finished product. By reducing or eliminating this added step using our proprietary monolithic integration techniques, we believe we can achieve cost savings in, and increase the reliability of, our PV modules. We believe our technology and manufacturing process, which results in a lighter, flexible module package, provides us with unique market opportunities relative to both the crystalline silicon ( c-Si ) based PV manufacturers that currently lead the PV market, as well as other thin-film PV manufacturers that use substrate materials such as glass, stainless steel or other metals that can be heavier and more rigid than plastics.  
  Currently, we are producing consumer and military oriented products focusing on charging devices powered by or enhanced by our solar modules. Products in these markets are priced based on the overall value proposition rather than a commodity-style price per watt basis. We continue to develop new consumer products and we have adjusted the utilization of our equipment to meet our near term forecast sales. We plan to continue the development of our current PV technology to increase module efficiency, improve our manufacturing tooling and process capabilities and reduce manufacturing costs. We also plan to continue to take advantage of research and development contracts to fund a portion of this development.

management to evaluate, in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide certain disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists. ASU 2014-15 is effective for all entities for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  We have not early adopted ASU 2014-15. The Company is researching whether the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11  , Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which states that inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize all leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet as a lease asset or lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease. ASU 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures regarding leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including 1) accounting for income taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, 5) cash flow classification of employee taxes withheld in the form of shares, 6) the practical expedient for estimating the expected term, and 7) intrinsic value. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the implementation of ASU 2016-09 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Revenues.   Our net revenues were   $453,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,253,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $800,000  . Revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   include   $437,000   of product sales compared to   $1,177,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $741,000  .  The decrease in product sales is largely the result of significantly decreased sales during the quarter to one of our large customers.  Additionally during the second quarter, the Company entered into an amendment to our agreement with a different large customer. The terms of the amendment have delayed revenue recognition of our products sold to this large customer by ninety days. Revenues earned on our government research and development contracts decreased by   $60,000   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $16,000  .  
    
  Cost of revenues.   Our Cost of revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,332,000   compared to   $2,292,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $960,000  .  The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in materials costs as a result of a decrease in units sold as compared to the   third   quarter in the prior year.  Cost of revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   is comprised of Materials and Freight of   $656,000  , Direct Labor of   $96,000  , and Overhead of   $580,000  .  Management believes our factory is currently significantly under-utilized, and a substantial increase in revenue would result in marginal increases to Direct Labor and Overhead.  We are currently offering promotions and discounts in order to penetrate new markets.  While these promotions and discounts have proved effective in building our brand and acquiring new customers, our gross margins have been negatively impacted.  
  Research, development and manufacturing operations.   Research, development and manufacturing operations costs were   $1,660,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,732,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $72,000  .  Research, development and manufacturing operations costs include costs incurred for product development, pre-production and production activities in our manufacturing facility. Research, development and manufacturing operations costs also include costs related to technology development and governmental contracts.  The following factors contributed to the increase in research, development, and manufacturing operations expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  :

           3. 
    Consulting and contract services increased   $62,000   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was a result of increased consulting expenses related to the Company's financing efforts.

The decrease is primarily due to non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt discounts related to the Notes, Series D Preferred Stock and Series D-1 Preferred Stock.  We did not incur substantial interest expense as a result of these instruments during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   because these instruments are no longer outstanding.   
       
           2. 
    Change in fair value of derivatives and gain/(loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, net increased   $9,097,000   as compared to the second quarter of 2015.  The increase in this non-cash expense is the result of changes in the fair value of our embedded derivative instruments during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , and extinguishments of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock.

The decrease in product sales is largely the result of significantly decreased sales during the second and third quarters to one of our large customers.  Additionally during the second quarter, the Company entered into an amendment to our agreement with a different large customer. The terms of the amendment have delayed revenue recognition of our products sold to this large customer by ninety days.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $0.1 million   in cash and cash equivalents 
    
  On September 4, 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement with two accredited investors (the  Accredited Investors ). Pursuant to the note purchase agreement, we issued to the Accredited Investors   $1.5 million   original principal amount of secured subordinated convertible notes on September 4, 2015, and an additional   $0.5 million   original principal amount of secured subordinated convertible notes on September 28, 2015. On April 29, 2016, we entered into Exchange Agreements (the  Exchange Agreements ), with the Accredited Investors to cancel the secured subordinated convertible notes.  In exchange, we issued to the Accredited Investors rights to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of Rights to Receive Common Stock dated April 29, 2016.  Additionally, on April 29, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreements with the Accredited Investors for the private placement of   $2.0 million   of our newly designated Series G Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series G Preferred Stock ).

On November 4, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a private investor (the "Private Investor") to issue   2,800   shares of Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for   $2.8 million  .  
    
  On November 10, 2015, we entered into a committed equity line purchase agreement (the "CEL") with the Private Investor.  Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the CEL purchase agreement, at our option we have the right to sell to the Private Investor, and the Private Investor is obligated to purchase from us, up to   $32.2 million   of the our common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing on December 18, 2015, the date that the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC.  The remaining availability under the CEL as of   September 30, 2016   is   $29.1 million  .   
    
  Actual sales of shares of common stock to the Private Investor under the CEL purchase agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, our ability to register shares of common stock with the SEC, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. 
    
  As of January 27, 2016, we were not able to access the CEL because we do not have any registered shares available for use in connection with the CEL purchase agreement.  We are in the process of registering an additional   2,400,000   shares for such purpose with the SEC.  If such additional registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and such additional shares become available for use, our sales of shares pursuant to the CEL purchase agreement during 2016 would be limited to such   2,400,000   shares.  Our use of the CEL in 2017 and beyond would require, among other things, us to file additional registration statements in the future that cover additional shares and have such registration statements declared effective.  We would also need to maintain the effectiveness of such additional registration statements. 
    
  On January 19, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Series F SPA ) with the Private Investor for the sale of   $7 million   of our newly designated Series F 7% Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series F Preferred Stock ).  
    
  On June 9, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Series H SPA ) with the Private Investor for the sale of up to   $2.5 million   of the our newly designated Series H 7% Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series H Preferred Stock ).  However, subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we entered into an exchange agreement to cancel the Series H Preferred Stock.  However, on July 13, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement to cancel the Series H Preferred Stock. 
    
  On July 13, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with the Private Investor for the private placement of up to   $2,080,000   of our 4% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the "July 2016 Convertible Notes").  
    
  On September 19, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with one accredited investor for the private placement of   $1,350,000   of our newly designated Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series J Preferred Stock ).  
    
  We have continued PV production at our manufacturing facility. We do not expect that sales revenue and cash flows will be sufficient to support operations and cash requirements until we have fully implemented our consumer products strategy. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used   $13.6 million   in cash for operations. Our primary significant long term cash obligation consists of a note payable of   $5.6 million   to a financial institution secured by a mortgage on our headquarters and manufacturing building in Thornton, Colorado. Total payments of   $0.3 million  , including principal and interest, will come due in the remainder of 2016. We owe   $0.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   related to a litigation settlement reached in April 2014, which is being paid in equal installments over   40   months, which began in April 2014.  
     
  Additional projected product revenues are not anticipated to result in a positive cash flow position for the year   2016   overall and as of   September 30, 2016   we have negative working capital. As such, cash liquidity sufficient for the year ending   December 31, 2016   will require additional financing. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we entered into securities purchase agreements totaling   $1.3 million   of additional funding.   
    
  We have continued to accelerate sales and marketing efforts related to its consumer and military solar products and specialty PV application strategies through expansion of its sales and distribution channels. We have begun activities related to securing additional financing through strategic or financial investors, but there is no assurance we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If our revenues do not increase rapidly, and/or additional financing is not obtained, we will be required to significantly curtail operations to reduce costs and/or sell assets. Such actions would likely have an adverse impact on our future operations. As a result of the Company s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to

maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
  Statements of Cash Flows Comparison of the Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash used in operations was   $13.6 million   compared to   $17.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $4.0 million  . The decrease is primarily due to relatively consistent inventory levels as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we increased inventory levels as compared to December 31, 2014 which significantly increased our cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash used in investing activities was   $0.2 million   as compared to   $0.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  .   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , negative operating cash flows of   $13.6 million   were funded through   $10.4 million   of funding received from issuances of preferred stock,   $1.1 million   of funding received from the CEL,    $2.0 million   of funding received from the July 2016 Convertible Notes, and the use of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2015. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table presents our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . Our long-term debt obligation is related to our building loan reflecting both principal and interest. Our purchase obligations include orders for equipment, inventory and operating expenses. 

Off Balance Sheet Transactions 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  Historically, we have purchased manufacturing equipment internationally, which exposes us to foreign currency risk. 
  From time to time we enter into foreign currency fair value hedges utilizing forward contracts designed to match scheduled contractual payments to equipment suppliers. Our objective is to fix the dollar amount of our foreign currency denominated manufacturing equipment purchases at the time of order. Although our hedging activity is designed to fix the dollar amount to be expended, the asset purchased is recorded at the spot foreign currency rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier. The difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as gain or loss on forward contract. We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. All forward contracts entered into by us have been settled on the contract settlement dates, the last of which was settled in December 2009.  
  Although our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate, make sales and buy materials. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk. Further, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents. As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash equivalents consisted only of federally insured operating and savings accounts held with financial institutions. From time to time we hold money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities and high quality corporate securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. The direct risk to

     Table of Contents  

us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Credit Risk 
  From time to time we hold certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments and foreign currency option contracts. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments. We place cash, cash equivalents, investments and forward foreign currency option contracts with various high-quality financial institutions, and exposure is limited at any one institution. We continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counter party financial institutions.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and interim Principal Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and interim Principal Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Disclosure and Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  On October 21, 2011, we were notified that a complaint (the  Lawsuit ) was filed by Jefferies   Company, Inc. ("Jefferies") against us in state court located in the County and State of New York. 
    
  In December 2010, we and Jefferies entered into an engagement agreement (the  Fee Agreement ) pursuant to which Jefferies was hired to act as our financial advisor in relation to certain potential transactions. In the Lawsuit, Jefferies claims it is entitled to receive an investment banking fee of $3.0 million (plus expense reimbursement of approximately $49,000) under the Fee Agreement in connection with the August 2011 investment and strategic alliance transaction (the  Financing ) between us and TFG Radiant.  In addition, should it prevail at trial, Jefferies would be able to claim an award for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest in the approximate amount of $1.2 million. 
  On April 16, 2014, the parties settled the lawsuit where the Company agreed to pay Jefferies a total of   $2.0 million   in equal installments over   40   months.  The Company has paid   $450,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company records a liability in its financial statements for costs related to claims, including settlements and judgments, where the Company has assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrued $  1.7 million  , the net present value of the   $2.0 million   settlement, as of December 31, 2013.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $0   was accrued for the long-term portion of this settlement and   $479,000   was recorded as Accrued litigation settlement, current portion, in the Balance Sheets.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the updated risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 11, 2016, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 11, 2016 are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
