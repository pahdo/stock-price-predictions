NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION  

China United Insurance Service, Inc. ( China
United  or  CUIS ) is a Delaware corporation organized on June 4, 2010 by Yi Hsiao Mao, a Taiwanese citizen,
as a listing vehicle for ZLI Holdings Limited ( ZLI Holdings ) to be quoted on the United States Over the Counter Bulletin
Board. 

The corporate structure as of September
30, 2016 is as follows: 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Principles of Consolidation  

The unaudited accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of China United and its subsidiaries as shown in the organization structure in Note 1
above. All significant intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. 

Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement
of the financial statements have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, which were included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, has been derived from the Company s audited
consolidated financial statements as of that date. 

Translation Adjustment  

The Company s financial statements
are presented in U.S. dollars ($), which is the Company s reporting and functional currency. The functional currencies of
the Company s subsidiaries are NTD, RMB and HKD. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional
currency rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded amount and the settlement amount
are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated statements of operations. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Any differences are taken to profit or loss as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in the statements of
operations. 

In accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency
Matters, the Company translates the assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using the rate of exchange prevailing at the
balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at an average rate during the reporting period.
Adjustments resulting from the translation from NTD, RMB and HKD into U.S. dollars are recorded in stockholders  equity as
part of accumulated other comprehensive income. The exchange rates used for interim financial statements in accordance with ASC
830, Foreign Currency Matters, are as follows: 

Concentration of Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable.
As of September 30, 2016, approximately $1,600,000 of the Company s cash and equivalents held by financial institutions was
insured, and the remaining balance of approximately $23,300,000 was not insured. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company s revenue from sale of insurance policies underwritten by these companies were: 

(*)  
      Revenue for the three months ended had not exceeded 10% or more of the consolidated revenue.   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company s revenue from sale of insurance policies underwritten by these companies were: 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company s accounts receivable from these companies were: 

(**)  
      Accounts receivable for the year ended had not exceeded 10% or more of the consolidated accounts receivable.   

With respect to accounts receivable, the
Company generally does not have any collateral and does not have an allowance for doubtful accounts. 

The Company s operations are in the
People s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan and Hong Kong. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and
results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic, foreign currency exchange and legal environments in the PRC,
Taiwan and Hong Kong, and by the state of each economy. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in the
political and social conditions in the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws
and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model
for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition
guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date. The amendment in this update defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year to annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date, interim and annual reporting periods after
December 15, 2016. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt
ASU 2014-09. The Company is still in the process of analyzing the effect of this new standard, including the transition method,
to determine the impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related
disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires that all
deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
ASU 2015-17 will be effective for the Company, but will not cause a material impact on the Company s financial condition
or the results of the Company s operations. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial
instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under
the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies
guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on
available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet
at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the
provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific
credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in
ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both
financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard
will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-03,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350); Business Combinations (Topic 805); Consolidation
(Topic 810); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effective Date and Transition Guidance . The amendments in this ASU make
the guidance in ASUs 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014-07, and 2014-18 effective immediately by removing their effective dates. The amendments
also include transition provisions that provide that private companies are able to forgo a preferability assessment the first time
they elect the accounting alternatives within the scope of this ASU. Any subsequent change to an accounting policy election requires
justification that the change is preferable under Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The amendments in this ASU
also extend the transition guidance in ASUs 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014-07, and 2014-18 indefinitely. While this ASU extends transition
guidance for Updates 2014-07 and 2014-18, there is no intention to change how transition is applied for those two ASUs. The Company
is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-07,  Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to
the Equity Method of Accounting.  ASU No. 2016-07 eliminates the requirement for an investment that qualifies for the use
of the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence to adjust the investment,
results of operations and retained earnings retrospectively. ASU No. 2016-07 will be effective prospectively for the Company for
increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method that occur
during or after the quarter ending December 31, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The impact of this guidance for the Company
is dependent on any future increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the
equity method. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net) .  The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) . Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting.  ASU No. 2016-09 impacts certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income
tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statements of cash flows.
ASU No. 2016-09 will be effective for the Company for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently assessing the impact adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230) to Statement of Cash
Flows.  ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash
flows to reduce diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon
debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest
rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance
policies, (vi) distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions,
and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of
this update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-17,  Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  (ASU 2016-17),
which amends the consolidation guidance in ASU 2015-02 regarding the treatment of indirect interests held through related parties
that are under common control. ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-17 and does
not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

There were other updates recently issued.
The management does not believe that other than disclosed above, the recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting pronouncements
will have a material impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows.

estimated fair value of derivatives and record changes to operations. The discounts relating to the initial recording of the derivatives

Commission mandated any insurance agency have a minimum registered capital requirement of RMB50 million ( approximately

Anhou intends to increase its registered capital to RMB50 million so that it can set up new branches in any province beyond its
current operations in Mainland China. 

Due to certain restriction on direct foreign
investment in insurance agency business under current PRC legal requirements, Anhou sought investments from certain Investor Borrowers

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

The following discussion of the results
of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in Item 1 of this report. This report, including the information incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of any of the words  believe, 
 expect,   anticipate,   plan,   estimate,  and similar expressions are intended
to identify such statements. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our possible or assumed future results. The
actual results that we achieve may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements due to the risks and
uncertainties described in the Risk Factors section of this report, in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and in other sections of this report, as well as in our annual report on Form 10-K. We undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 

Overview  

The Company primarily provides two broad
categories of insurance products, life insurance products and property and casualty insurance products, in Taiwan and People s
Republic of China ( PRC ).The Company also provides reinsurance brokerage services and insurance consulting services
in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The percentage of reinsurance brokerage services and insurance consulting services is less than 1% of
our total revenue. The insurance products that the Company s subsidiaries sell are underwritten by some of leading insurance
companies in Taiwan and PRC, respectively. 

(1)      Life Insurance Products   

Total net revenue from Taiwan
life insurance products were 80.25% and 81.94% of total net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Total net revenue from PRC life insurance products were 12.43% and 10.76% of total net revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In addition to the periodic premium
payment schedules, most of the individual life insurance products we distribute also allow the insured to choose to make a single,
lump-sum premium payment at the beginning of the policy term. If a periodic payment schedule is adopted by the insured, a life
insurance policy can generate periodic payment of fixed premiums to the insurance company for a specified period of time. This
means that once the Company sells a life insurance policy with a periodic premium payment schedule, they will be able to derive
commission and fee income from that policy for an extended period of time, sometimes up to 25 years. Because of this feature and
the expected sustained growth of life insurance sales in China and Taiwan, we have focused significant resources ever since the
incorporation of Anhou and Law Broker on developing our capability to distribute individual life insurance products with periodic
payment schedules. We expect that sales of life insurance products will continuously be our primary source of revenue in the next
several years. 

(2)      Property and Casualty Insurance Products   

Taiwan subsidiary commenced sale
of automobile insurance, casualty insurance and liability insurance business in August 2003. Total net revenue from Taiwan property
and casualty insurance products were 5.34% and 5.82% of total net revenue for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Consolidated Affiliated Entities ( CAE ) in PRC commenced its sales of commercial property insurance
in 2009 and developed its automobile insurance business in 2010. Total net revenue from PRC property and casualty insurance products
were 1.63% and 1.48% of total net revenue for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

A critical accounting policy is one that
is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires our management s most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
included within our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Following is a discussion
of the accounting policies that we believe involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates. 

Accrued Expense 

As part of the process of preparing our
financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. The estimation basis of the majority of the accrued expenses
is dependent on our sales force s achievement of the sales targets identified by our clients. Examples of estimated accrued
expenses include brokerage commission bonus, such as bonus payable to our sales agents, and incentive program rewards, such as
the estimated expenditures to fund the reward programs. We develop estimates of liabilities using our judgment based upon the facts
and circumstances known at the time. 

Long-term investment 

The Company classifies its investments
as available-for-sale in accordance with ASC 320  Debt and Equity Securities , and Investments   Debt and Equity
Securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses as a result of changes in the fair value of the available-for-sale
investments are recorded as a separate component within accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. 

The Company uses the cost method of accounting
for investments in companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which it holds an interest of less than 20%
and over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. Investments are considered to be impaired when a
decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary,
an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. 

Convertible bonds 

Convertible debt is accounted for under
the guidelines established by ASC 470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options.  ASC 470-20 governs the calculation
of an embedded beneficial conversion. The amount of the value of beneficial conversion feature may reduce the carrying value of
the instrument to zero, but no further. Many of the conversion features embedded in the Company s notes are variable and
are adjusted based on a discount to market prices which could cause an unlimited number of shares of common stock to be issued.
In these cases, the Company records the embedded conversion feature as a derivative instrument, at fair value. The embedded conversion
features are recorded as discounts when the notes become convertible. The excess of fair value of the embedded conversion feature
over the carrying value of the debt is recorded as an immediate charge to operations. Each reporting period, the Company will compute
the estimated fair value of derivatives and record changes to operations. The discounts relating to the initial recording of the
derivatives or beneficial conversion features will be amortized over the terms of the convertible bonds. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model
for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition
guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date. The amendment in this update defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year to annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date, interim and annual reporting periods after
December 15, 2016. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt
ASU 2014-09. The Company is still in the process of analyzing the effect of this new standard, including the transition method,
to determine the impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related
disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires that all
deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
ASU 2015-17 will be effective for the Company, but will not cause a material impact on the Company s financial condition
or the results of the Company s operations. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial
instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under
the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies
guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on
available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet
at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the
provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific
credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in
ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both
financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard
will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-03,
 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350); Business Combinations (Topic 805); Consolidation (Topic 810); Derivatives and

2014-03, 2014-07, and 2014-18 effective immediately by removing their effective dates. The amendments also include transition provisions
that provide that private companies are able to forgo a preferability assessment the first time they elect the accounting alternatives
within the scope of this ASU. Any subsequent change to an accounting policy election requires justification that the change is
preferable under Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The amendments in this ASU also extend the transition guidance
in ASUs 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014-07, and 2014-18 indefinitely. While this ASU extends transition guidance for Updates 2014-07 and
2014-18, there is no intention to change how transition is applied for those two ASUs. The Company is currently in the process
of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence to adjust the investment, results of
operations and retained earnings retrospectively. ASU No. 2016-07 will be effective prospectively for the Company for increases
in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method that occur during or
after the quarter ending December 31, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The impact of this guidance for the Company is dependent
on any future increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus
Net) .  The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation
guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative
examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the
effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Public entities
should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting
periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial
statements.

Overview of the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The following table shows the results of
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Revenue  

As a distributor of insurance products,
we derive our revenue primarily from commissions and fees paid by insurance companies, typically calculated as a percentage of
premiums paid by our customers to the insurance companies in among Taiwan, People s Republic of China ( PRC )
and Hong Kong. We generate revenue primarily through our sales force, which consists of individual sales agents in our distribution
and service network. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the revenue generated respectively from Taiwan, PRC
and Hong Kong is as follows: 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, 85.0%, 14.6% and 0.4% of our revenue in our unaudited consolidated financial statements were derived from
Taiwan, PRC and Hong Kong, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, 87.6%, 11.3% and 1.1% of our
revenue in our unaudited consolidated financial statements were derived from Taiwan, PRC and Hong Kong, respectively. The

Total revenue increased by $3,508,820,
or 30.7%, from $11,442,525 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $14,951,345 for the three months ended September 30,
2016. The increase was mainly due to the Taiwan central bank s decreased interest rate, which caused an increase in the demand
for both investment-oriented insurance and long-term care insurance.

commissions paid to our sales agents. The cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1,952,912
or 26.5%, to $9,335,735 compared to $7,382,823 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary attribute of the heightened
cost of revenue is the portion of the first-year commission (FYC) revenue over total revenue increased noticeably. Since the commission
rate of FYC revenue is comparatively higher than any other types of commission revenue, the cost of revenue increased accordingly. 

The gross profit for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 increased by $1,555,908 or 38.3%, to $5,615,610 compared to $4,059,702 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The gross profit ratio increased to 38% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 35% for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The primary attribute of the heightened cost of revenue is the portion of the first-year commission (FYC) revenue

decreased by $390,679 or 38.3%, to $630,255 compared to $1,020,934 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
is mainly due to decreased the advertising expense spent in publicity of the Company s brand.

and amortization, entertainment expenses, and professional service fees to the auditor and attorney.

operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Revenue  

As a distributor of insurance products,

2016, which is mainly due to the increase of the revenue in Taiwan and PRC for the following reasons, 

a)    The
sales of Farglory Life Insurance Co., Ltd ( Farglory ) increased in 2016 because Farglory bundles its life insurance
products to customize each of its clients' needs better. By combining insurance contracts with the diversified term, premium,
and coverage arrangements, the increased flexibility of the products of Farglory drew more attentions from the company s
customers and thus boosted the sales performance for the period ended September 30, 2016.  

b)    The
sales of Taiwan Life Insurance Co., Ltd ( Taiwan Life ) have increased in 2016. The main reason is the launch of Taiwan

This selling package drew more attention from the company s customers and boosted the sales performance for the period ended
September 30, 2016.  

c)    The
sales increase in the PRC area was primarily because the Company expanded its business geographically and set up a new branch
in Yunnan, Guangdong and has gained its reputation within local markets to generate higher revenue for the period ended September

Anhou Registered Capital Increase  

On April 27, 2013, the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission ( CIRC ) issued the Decision on Revising the Provisions of the Supervision and Administration
of Specialized Insurance Agencies (the  Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions ), pursuant to which, CIRC mandated
any insurance agency established subsequent to the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions to meet a minimum registered capital
requirement of RMB50 million ( approximately $8 million ). On May 16, 2013, CIRC issued
Notice for Further Clarification on Related Issues of Access to Professional Insurance Intermediary Market (the  Notice ),
pursuant to which, professional insurance agencies established prior to the issuance of the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions,
with registered capital less than RMB50 million ( approximately $8 million ) can continue
to operate its existing business within the provinces where they have a registered office or branch office, but shall not set up
any new branches in any provinces where it has no registered office or a branch office. 

Prior to the capital increase, Anhou, a
professional insurance agency with a PRC nationwide license, used to have a registered capital of RMB10 million (approximately
$1.6 million). The branch offices of Anhou currently were all in Henan province. To better implement its expansion strategies,
Anhou intended to increase its registered capital to RMB50 million ( approximately $8 million) 
to meet the requirement of CIRC so that it can set up new branches in any province beyond its current operations in Mainland China. 

Due to certain restrictions on direct foreign
investment in insurance agency business under current PRC legal regime, Anhou has sought certain investments made by the Investor
Borrowers and they may need funds through individual loans. Upon the completion of the contemplated increase of registered capital
of Anhou, each Investor Borrower shall, or cause their designated persons to, enter into the Variable Interest Entities Agreement
with CU WFOE, Anhou and other parties so as to consolidate any additional VIE interest generated from the said registered capital
increase into the Company.  

On June 9, 2013, AHFL entered into a Loan
Agreement (the  Company Loan Agreement ) with ZLI Holdings Limited ( ZLI Holdings ), its wholly-owned Hong
Kong subsidiary. 

Under the Company Loan Agreement, AHFL
agreed to provide a loan to ZLI Holdings with the principal amount equal to the US Dollar equivalent of RMB40,000,000 ($6,389,925).
The term for such was ten years which could be extended upon the agreement of the parties. The amount of such loan was remitted
to the account of ZLI Holdings on August 30, 2013. 

In August 2013, ZLI Holdings entered into
several Loan Agreements (collectively, the  Investor Loan Agreements ) with the following unrelated parties: Able Capital
Holding Co., Ltd., a limited liability company established and registered in Hong Kong, Mr. Chen Li and Ms. Yue Jing, both PRC
citizens (collectively, the  Investor Borrowers ). 

Under the Investor Loan Agreements, the
Investor Borrowers loaned cash from ZLI Holdings for their investment in Anhou and ZLI Holdings agreed to provide certain loans
to each of the Investor Borrowers with an aggregate principal amount equal to the US Dollar equivalent of RMB40,000,000 ($6,389,925).
The term for such loans was ten years which could be extended upon the agreement of the parties. Pursuant to the Investor Loan
Agreements, each of the Investor Borrowers covenants to enter into certain Variable Interest Entities Agreements with Anhou, CU
WFOE and certain existing shareholders of Anhou. The proceeds received from the said loans by the Investor Borrowers shall be solely
used to increase the registered capital of Anhou, and ZLI Holdings may determine the repayment methods including transferring of
the Investor Borrowers  corresponding registered capital in Anhou or through other manner as full payment of the loans subject
to terms and conditions therein in the event that the Investor Borrowers fail to repay the loan in currency to ZLI Holdings. 

The specific amounts loaned to the Investor
Borrowers were as follows: 

Able Capital Holding Co., Ltd.: RMB29,500,000
($4,712,570) 

 Mr. Chen: RMB3,000,000 ($479,244) 

 Ms. Yue: RMB7,500,000 ($1,198,111) 

On October 20, 2013, the Investor Borrowers,
through certain nominees, increased Anhou s registered capital by RMB 40 million ($6,389,925).

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not participated in any transactions
with unconsolidated entities, such as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary
course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in
financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of
RMB11,294,942, approximately $1,694,000, HKD2,158,689, approximately $278,000 and NTD714,666,879, approximately $22,817,000. We
hold our cash for working capital purposes. Declines in interest rates would reduce future interest income. For the nine and three
months ended September 30, 2016, the effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have
had a material impact on our interest income. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

The functional currency for the subsidiaries
in Taiwan is NTD, the functional currency for the subsidiaries in Hong Kong is HKD and the functional currency for the subsidiaries
and CAE in PRC is RMB. The financial statements of the Company are in USD. The fluctuation of NTD and RMB will affect our operating
results expressed in USD. The Company reviews its foreign currency exposures. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements
with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments. The management does not consider its present foreign
exchange risk to be significant. 

ITEM 4. INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to ensure the information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms relating to us, and was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting   

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation performed
during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

From time to time we are involved in legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, we currently believe that there is no litigation pending that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.
Regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion
of management resources and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  

There have been no material changes from
the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year period ended December 31, 2015.
