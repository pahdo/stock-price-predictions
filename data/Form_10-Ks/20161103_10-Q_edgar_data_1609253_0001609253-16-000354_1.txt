NOTE 1    THE SPIN-OFF AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION                                               
    
  The Separation and Spin-off 
    
  We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating properties exclusively within the State of California. We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) on April 23, 2014, and remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental until November 30, 2014.  Prior to November 30, 2014, all material existing assets, operations and liabilities of Occidental's California business were consolidated under us.  On November 30, 2014, Occidental distributed shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to Occidental stockholders and we became an independent, publicly traded company (the Spin-off).  Occidental initially retained approximately 18.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which it distributed to Occidental stockholders on March 24, 2016. 
    
  Except when the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, all references to   CRC,   the   Company,     we,     us   and   our   refer to California Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
    
  Basis of Presentation  
    
  In the opinion of our management, the accompanying financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly present our financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and the statements of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as applicable.   We have eliminated all of our significant intercompany transactions and accounts.  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we reclassified prior period gains on debt transactions, net of costs, from other (income) expenses, net, to net gain on early extinguishment of debt.  Additionally, we reclassified the current portion of deferred taxes of $59 million as of December 31, 2015 from other current assets to other assets, in accordance with the retrospective application of recently issued accounting rules. 
    
  We have prepared this report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to interim financial information, which permit omission of certain disclosures to the extent they have not changed materially since the latest annual financial statements.  We believe our disclosures are adequate to make the information not misleading.  This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and the notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

NOTE 2 
    ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES 
       
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules that modify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued rules that change how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value.  These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued rules intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. These rules have the same effective date, generally in the first interim period of fiscal year 2018, as the related revenue standard issued in 2014.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  
   6 

In March 2016, the FASB simplified several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted these rules in the second quarter of 2016 with no material changes reflected in our financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months and to include qualitative and quantitative disclosures with respect to the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These rules will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued rules that modify how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities.  Unless the investments qualify for a practicality exception, the new rules require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee).  Entities will have to record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option in other comprehensive income.  These new rules become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with no early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules, but we do not expect them to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

NOTE 3 
    OTHER INFORMATION 
       
  Other current assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included amounts due from joint interest partners, net, of approximately   $36 million   and   $42 million   and derivative assets from commodities contracts of $25 million and $88 million, respectively.  
    
  Other assets at   December 31, 2015   included deferred tax assets of approximately $258 million (none at   September 30, 2016  ).  
    
  Accrued liabilities reflected greenhouse gas obligations of $86 million and $6 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively; accrued interest of $67 million and $39 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and derivative liabilities from commodities contracts of $64 million at   September 30, 2016   (none at   December 31, 2015  ). 
    
    Other long-term liabilities included asset retirement obligations of   $332 million   and $343 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Other revenue largely comprised sales of the portion of electricity generated by our power plant that is sold to third parties, and the related costs are included in other expenses.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , other expenses also included a $31 million of gain from the sale of non-core assets. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts of cash and other on-balance sheet financial instruments, other than debt, approximate fair value.  
    
  Supplemental Cash Flow Information  
    
  We did not make United States federal and state income tax payments during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Interest paid totaled approximately   $244 million   and   $248 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Reverse Stock Split 
    
  Our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at the Company's annual stockholders  meeting on May 4, 2016.  Following this approval, our board of directors authorized a reverse split using a ratio of one share of common stock for every ten shares then outstanding.  The split occurred on May 31, 2016 with trading on a post-split basis commencing the following day.  Share and per share amounts included in this report have been restated to reflect this reverse stock split. 
    
  The split proportionally decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 2.0 billion shares to 200 million shares and preferred stock from 200 million to 20 million shares.  The compensation committee of our board approved proportionate adjustments to the number of shares outstanding and available for issuance under our stock-based compensation plans and to the exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any award under the plans, using the same reverse split ratio, pursuant to existing authority granted to the committee under the plans.

Credit Facilities 
    
  Our first lien, first out credit facility (2014 First Out Credit Facilities) comprises (i) a   $671 million   senior term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and (ii) a $1.4 billion senior revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility).  We are permitted to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $250 million if we obtain additional commitments from new or existing lenders.  The facility matures at the earlier of November 2019 and the 182nd day prior to the maturity of our 5% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the 2020 notes), to the extent more than $100 million of such notes remain outstanding at such date.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $193 million   in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2020 notes. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a sub-limit of $400 million for the issuance of letters of credit.  
    
  As of February 2016, we amended the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities to change certain of our financial and other covenants. We again amended this agreement in April 2016 to facilitate certain types of deleveraging transactions and in August 2016 to further change certain of our covenants, grant additional collateral to our lenders and permit the incurrence of debt under a new first-lien, second-out term loan credit facility (2016 Second Out Credit Agreement).  Borrowings under the 2014 First Out Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base that was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion as of November 2016.  We have granted the lenders under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities a first-priority lien in a substantial majority of our assets, including our Elk Hills power plant and midstream assets.  We also granted a lien in the same assets to the lenders under our 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement and the holders of our senior second lien secured notes due in 2022. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of   $772 million   and $739 million, respectively, and outstanding borrowings of $671 million and $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility, respectively.  We made scheduled quarterly payments on the Term Loan Facility during the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, an $11 million prepayment from the proceeds of non-core asset sales in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and a $250 million prepayment from proceeds of the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement. 
    
  Borrowings under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities bear interest, at our election, at either a LIBOR rate or an alternate base rate (ABR) (equal to the greatest of (i) the administrative agent s prime rate, (ii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% and (iii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%), in each case plus an applicable margin.  This applicable margin is based, while our total leverage ratio exceeds 3.00:1.00, on our borrowing base utilization and will vary from (a) in the case of LIBOR loans, 2.50% to 3.50% and (b) in the case of ABR loans, 1.50% to 2.50%.  The unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility commitments, as limited by the borrowing base, is subject to a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum.  We also pay customary fees and expenses under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities.  Interest on ABR loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of each LIBOR period, but not less than quarterly. 
    
  Our financial performance covenants under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities require that (i) the ratio of our first priority, first out secured debt to trailing four quarter EBITDAX (the First-Lien First-Out Leverage Ratio) not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 at any quarter end through the quarter ending June 30, 2017 and 3.25 to 1.00 for the quarters ending September 30 and December 31, 2017 and (ii) the total interest expense coverage ratio at each quarter end not be less than 1.20 to 1.00 at any quarter end through the quarter ending December 31, 2017.  Starting with the end of the first quarter of 2018, the First-Lien First-Out Leverage Ratio may not exceed 2.25 to 1.00 and the total interest expense coverage ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1.00.   The covenants also include a new first-lien asset coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 as of any June 30 and December 31 beginning December 31, 2016, which is consistent with a covenant included in the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement described below.  

9 

Our 2014 First Out Credit Facilities require us to apply 100% of the proceeds from asset sales to repay loans outstanding under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, except that we are permitted to use up to 40% (or, if our leverage ratio is less than 4:00 to 1:00, 60%) of proceeds from non-borrowing base asset monetizations to repurchase our notes to the extent available at a significant minimum discount to par, as specified in the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities.  The 2014 First Out Credit Facilities also permit us to incur up to an additional $50 million of non-credit-facility indebtedness, which may be secured by non-borrowing base assets, subject to compliance with our financial covenants and indentures; the proceeds of which must be applied to repay the Term Loan Facility.   We must apply cash on hand in excess of $150 million daily to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Further, we are restricted from (i) paying dividends or making other distributions to common stockholders and (ii) making capital investments in excess of $125 million during 2016 or in excess of $200 million during 2017 with a carryover of unused 2016 amounts. The amount permitted to be invested can be increased dollar-for-dollar at any time after June 30, 2017 by the lesser of (a) $50 million and (b) the positive difference between (i) a measure of our liquidity as of June 30, 2017 and (ii) the sum of $500 million and net cash proceeds obtained from non-borrowing base asset dispositions. 
    
  Our borrowing base under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities is redetermined each May 1 and November 1.  The borrowing base will be based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserves.  Increases in our borrowing base require approval of at least 80% of our revolving lenders, as measured by exposure, while decreases or affirmations require a two-thirds approval.  We and the lenders (requiring a request from the lenders holding two-thirds of the revolving commitments and outstanding loans) each may request a special redetermination once in any period between three consecutive scheduled redeterminations.  We will be permitted to have collateral released when both (i) our credit ratings are at least Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S P, in each case with a stable or better outlook, and (ii) certain permitted liens securing other debt are released. 
    
  Substantially all of the restrictions imposed by the February 2016 amendment to the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, other than the requirement for semiannual borrowing base redeterminations, may terminate in the future if we are able to comply with the financial covenants as they existed prior to giving effect to the amendment. 
    
  The net borrowings under the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement were used to (i) prepay $250 million of the Term Loan Facility and (ii) reduce our Revolving Credit Facility by $740 million.   The proceeds received were net of a $10 million original issue discount.  The term loans bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to 10.375% plus LIBOR, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, determined for the applicable interest period (or ABR rates in certain circumstances).  Interest on ABR loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of each LIBOR period, but not less than quarterly. 
    
  The 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in the same collateral used to secure the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, but, under intercreditor arrangements with our 2014 First Out Credit Facilities lenders, are second in collateral recovery behind such lenders.  Prepayment of the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement is subject to a make-whole premium prior to the third anniversary of closing and a premium to par equal to 50% of coupon between the third anniversary and the fourth anniversary.  Following the fourth anniversary, we may redeem at par. The 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement matures on December 31, 2021, but if the aggregate principal amount outstanding of either our 2020 Notes or our 5 % senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2021 (the 2021 Notes) exceeds $100 million 91 days prior to their respective maturity dates, the maturity date of the term loans will accelerate to such prior 91st day.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   $193 million   and   $149 million   in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2020 notes and 2021 notes, respectively. 
    
  The 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement provides for customary covenants and events of default consistent with, or generally less restrictive than, the covenants in our 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, including limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, asset dispositions, investments, restricted payments and other negative covenants, in each case subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  Additionally, the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a first-lien asset coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 as of any June 30 and December 31 beginning December 31, 2016, consistent with the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities. 
    
  All obligations under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities and the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement (Credit Facilities) are guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our material wholly owned subsidiaries.  The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries not guaranteeing the debt are de minimis. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants under our Credit Facilities.

Senior Notes 
    
  In October 2014, we issued $5.00 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes, including $1.00 billion of 2020 notes, $1.75 billion of 2021 notes and $2.25 billion of 6% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2024 (the 2024 notes and together with the 2020 notes and the 2021 notes, the unsecured notes). The unsecured notes were issued at par and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our material subsidiaries. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured notes to make a $4.95 billion cash distribution to Occidental in October 2014. 
    
  In December 2015, we exchanged $534 million, $921 million and $1,358 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 notes, the 2021 notes, and the 2024 notes, respectively, for $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 8% senior secured second lien notes due December 15, 2022 (the 2022 notes).  We recorded a deferred gain of approximately $560 million on the debt exchange, which will be amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the 2022 notes.  Additionally, we incurred approximately $28 million in third-party costs which were fully expensed in 2015.  The second 2022 notes are secured on a second-priority basis, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement and collateral trust agreement, by a lien on the same collateral used to secure our obligations under our Credit Facilities. 
    
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased over $100 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes for under $13 million in cash.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with a holder of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 5  % Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock on a post-split basis for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $80 million.   
    
  In August 2016 we repurchased $197 million, $605 million and $613 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 notes, 2021 notes and 2024 notes, respectively, for $750 million, resulting in a $660 million pre-tax gain, net of related expenses.   Additionally, we wrote off approximately $12 million of deferred costs related to the repurchased notes.  
    
  In October 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and 5 1/2% Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of 1.3 million shares of our common stock for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million.  
    
  We will pay interest semiannually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 for the 2020 notes, on March 15 and September 15 for the 2021 notes, on June 15 and December 15 for the 2022 notes and on May 15 and November 15 for the 2024 notes.  
    
  The indentures governing the senior unsecured notes and the second lien secured notes each include covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries  ability to incur debt secured by liens.  The indentures also restrict our ability to merge or consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, another entity.  These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations that are set forth in the indenture.  The covenants are not, however, directly linked to measures of our financial performance.  In addition, if we experience a  change of control triggering event  (as defined in the indentures) with respect to a series of notes, we will be required, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series, to offer to purchase the notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  The indenture governing our second lien secured notes also restricts our ability to sell certain assets and to release collateral from liens securing the second lien secured notes, unless the collateral is released in compliance with our Credit Facilities. 
    
  Other 
    
  We estimate the fair value of fixed-rate debt, which is classified as Level 1, based on prices from known market transactions for our instruments.  The estimated fair value of our debt at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, including the fair value of the variable rate portion, was approximately   $4.3 billion   and $3.6 billion, respectively, compared to a carrying value of approximately   $5.2 billion   and   $6.1 billion  .  A one-eighth percent change in the variable interest rates on the borrowings under our Credit Facilities on   September 30, 2016  , would result in a   $3 million   change in annual interest expense.  

11 

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately   $127 million   and $70 million (including   $122 million   and $49 million under the Revolving Credit Facility), respectively, which were issued to support ordinary course marketing, insurance, regulatory and other matters.  

NOTE 6    LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  We, or certain of our subsidiaries, are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, environmental and other claims and other contingencies that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. 
    
  On April 21, 2016, a purported class action was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all beneficial owners of our unsecured notes from November 12, 2015 to the present.  The complaint alleges that our December 2015 debt exchange excluded non-qualified institutional holders in violation of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and related law and, thereby, impaired their rights to receive principal and interest payments.  The purported class action seeks declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens securing the new notes are null and void and that the debt exchange resulted in a default.  The plaintiff also seeks monetary damages and attorneys  fees.  The Company plans to vigorously defend against the claims made by the plaintiff. 
    
  We accrue reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.  Reserves balances at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 were not material to our balance sheets as of such dates.  We also evaluate the amount of reasonably possible losses that we could incur as a result of these matters.  We believe that reasonably possible losses that we could incur in excess of reserves accrued on our balance sheet would not be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  We, our subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specific liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with the Spin-off, purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with us.  These indemnities include indemnities made to Occidental against certain tax-related liabilities that may be incurred by Occidental relating to the Spin-off and liabilities related to operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we are not aware of material indemnity claims pending or threatened against the Company.   
    
  We were contacted by the Internal Revenue Service for examination of our U.S. federal income tax return for the one month ended December 2014.  Subsequent taxable years and state returns remain subject to examination. 

NOTE 7    DERIVATIVES 
    
  General 
    
  We use a variety of derivative instruments to protect our cash flows, margins and capital investment program from the cyclical nature of commodity prices and to improve our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants in case of further price deterioration.  We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in implementing our hedging program as market conditions permit. 
    
  Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.  We apply hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.  Otherwise, we recognize any fair value gains or losses, over the remaining term of the hedge instrument, in earnings in the current period.  

12 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any derivatives designated as hedges.  Unless otherwise indicated, we use the term "hedge" to describe derivative instruments that are designed to achieve our hedging program goals, even though they are not necessarily accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges.  As part of our hedging program, we entered into a number of derivative transactions that resulted in the following Brent-based crude oil and PG E City Gate-based gas hedge positions as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Certain of our 2017 crude oil swaps grant our counterparty a quarterly option to increase volumes by up to 10,000 barrels per day for that quarter at a weighted-average Brent price of $55.46. 
    
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we acquired additional hedges bringing our total swaps on our 2017 oil production to 20,000 barrels per day with a weighted-average Brent price of $53.98.  We also purchased derivative assets that partially reduced our call exposure on our 2017 production to a total of 15,500 barrels per day with a weighted-average Brent ceiling of $54.17.  Additionally, we reduced our Q4 2016 natural gas swaps to 3,800 MMBTU per day at a weighted-average price of $3.49 and our 2017 natural gas forward contracts to 4,700 MMBTU per day at a weighted-average price of $3.53.

Fair Value of Derivatives 
  Our commodity derivatives are measured at fair value using industry-standard models with various inputs, including quoted forward prices, and are all classified as Level 2 in the required fair value hierarchy for the periods presented.  The following table presents the fair values (at gross and net) of our outstanding derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions):

NOTE 8    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  We compute earnings per share (EPS) using the two-class method required for participating securities.  Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders in any period that we issue dividends.  Restricted and performance stock awards are considered participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares.   
    
  The denominator of basic EPS is the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented and vested stock awards that have not yet been issued as common stock; however, it excludes outstanding shares related to unvested stock awards.  The denominator of diluted EPS is based on the basic shares outstanding, adjusted for the effect of unvested stock awards and outstanding option awards, to the extent they are dilutive, and participating securities.  The effect of the stock options granted in August 2015 and December 2014 was anti-dilutive for the periods presented. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with a holder of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 5  % Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock on a post-split basis for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $80 million.  In October 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and 5  % Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of 1.3 million shares of our common stock for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million.  

14 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued approximately 53,000 shares and 237,000 shares, respectively, of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan.  
    
  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

NOTE 9    RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The following table sets forth the components of the net periodic benefit costs for our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans: 

15 

We contributed $1 million to our defined benefit pension plans during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ; however, no contributions were made during the same period of   2015  .  We contributed $7 million and $3 million to our defined benefit pension plans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We expect to satisfy minimum funding requirements with contributions of $1 million to our defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2016.  The 2016 and 2015 settlements were associated with early retirements.  

NOTE 10    INCOME TAXES 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had an income tax benefit of   $78 million   reflecting a change in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.  While we had pre-tax income of   $278 million   for the period, we had no income tax expense during the first nine months of 2016 because we expect a tax loss for 2016 for which no tax benefit has been recognized.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

Except when the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, all references to   CRC,   the   Company,     we,     us   and   our   refer to California Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
    
  General    
    
  We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating properties exclusively within the State of California. We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) on April 23, 2014, and remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental until November 30, 2014.  Prior to November 30, 2014, all material existing assets, operations and liabilities of Occidental's California business were consolidated under CRC.  On November 30, 2014, Occidental distributed shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to Occidental stockholders and we became an independent, publicly traded company (the Spin-off).  Occidental initially retained approximately 18.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which it distributed to Occidental stockholders on March 24, 2016. 
    
  On May 31, 2016 we completed a reverse stock split using a ratio of one share of common stock for every ten shares then outstanding. 
    
  In August 2016, we issued a new $1 billion first lien, second out term loan credit facility to prepay a portion of the existing term loans and revolving loans under our first lien, first out credit facility.  Additionally, we tendered for and repurchased $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes for $750 million using our existing revolver, resulting in a $660 million pre-tax gain, net of related expenses.  This tender offer resulted in a net debt reduction of $625 million.   

Business Environment and Industry Outlook    
    
  Our operating results and those of the oil and gas industry as a whole are heavily influenced by commodity prices.  Oil and gas prices and differentials may fluctuate significantly, generally as a result of changes in supply and demand and other market-related uncertainties.  These and other factors make it impossible to predict realized prices reliably.  Much of the global exploration and production industry is challenged at current price levels, putting pressure on the industry's ability to generate positive cash flow and access capital.  Average oil prices continued the decline that began in the last half of 2014 into the first quarter of 2016.  While global oil prices improved modestly through the third quarter of 2016 and started to trade in a narrower range, they were still lower in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. 
    
  Natural gas liquids (NGLs) prices have improved relative to crude oil prices over the last 12 months due to tighter supplies and higher contract prices on natural gasoline.  
    
  Natural gas prices remained lower in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 than comparable periods in 2015.  However, prices rebounded strongly in the second half of the year due to lower production, higher demand and warmer weather.  California natural gas differentials for the second half of the year also started to improve primarily due to reduced storage in the state.   
    
  The following table presents the average daily Brent, WTI and NYMEX prices for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

17 

Oil prices and differentials will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including consumption patterns, inventory levels, global and local economic conditions, the actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments, actual or threatened production and refining disruptions, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, the effects of conservation, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, refining and processing disruptions, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for oil, technological advances, regional market conditions, transportation capacity and costs in producing areas and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.   
    
  We currently sell all of our crude oil into the California refining markets, which we believe have offered relatively favorable pricing compared to other U.S. regions for similar grades.  California imports over 60% of its oil.  A vast majority of the oil is imported via supertanker, with a negligible amount arriving by rail.  As a result, California refiners have typically purchased crude oil at international waterborne-based prices.  We believe that the limited crude transportation infrastructure from other parts of the country to California will continue contributing to higher realizations than most other U.S. oil markets for comparable grades.  Beginning in late 2015, the U.S. federal government allowed the export of crude oil.  We are opportunistically pursuing newly opened export markets to improve our margins.  
    
  Prices and differentials for NGLs are related to the supply and demand for the products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify pricing volatility. 
    
  Natural gas prices and differentials are strongly affected by local market fundamentals, as well as availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.  Capacity influences prices because California imports about 90% of its natural gas from other parts of the U.S.  As a result, we typically enjoy favorable pricing against the NYMEX index since we can deliver our gas for much lower transportation costs.  Due to much lower levels of natural gas production compared to our oil production, the changes in natural gas prices have a lower impact on our operating results. 
    
  Higher natural gas prices have a net positive effect on our operating results.  In addition to selling natural gas, we also use gas for our steamfloods and power generation.  As a result, any positive impact of higher prices is partially offset by higher operating costs.  Conversely, lower natural gas prices generally have a net negative effect on our operations, but lower the cost of our steamflood projects and power generation.   
    
  Our earnings are also affected by the performance of our processing and power generation assets.  We process our wet gas to extract NGLs and other natural gas byproducts.  We then deliver dry gas to pipelines and separately sell the NGLs.  The efficiency with which we extract liquids from the wet gas stream affects our operating results.  Additionally, we provide part of the electricity output from our Elk Hills power plant to reduce operating costs to Elk Hills and nearby fields and increase reliability.  
    
  We opportunistically seek strategic hedging transactions to protect our cash flows, margins and capital investment programs from the cyclical nature of commodity prices and to improve our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants.   We can give no assurances that our hedges will be adequate to accomplish our objectives.  Unless otherwise indicated, we use the term "hedge" to describe derivative instruments that are designed to achieve our hedging program goals, even though they are not necessarily accounted for as cash-flow or fair-value hedges.     
       
  We respond to economic conditions by adjusting the size and allocation of our capital program, aligning the size of our workforce with the level of activity, continuing to improve efficiencies and cost savings and working with our suppliers and service providers to adjust the cost of goods and services to reflect current market pricing.  The reductions in our capital program will negatively impact our production levels in the near term and sustained low-price periods may materially affect the quantities of oil and gas reserves we can economically produce over the longer term. 

Seasonality    
    
  While certain aspects of our operations are affected by seasonal factors, such as electricity costs, overall, seasonality is not a material driver of changes in our quarterly results during the year. 

18 

Operations    
    
  We conduct our operations through fee interests, land leases and other contractual arrangements.  We believe we are the largest private oil and natural gas mineral acreage holder in California, with interests in approximately 2.4 million net acres, approximately 60% of which we hold in fee.  Our oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences.  We also own a network of strategically placed infrastructure that is integrated with our operations, including gas plants, oil and gas gathering systems, a power plant and other related assets, to maximize the value generated from our production. 
  Our share of production and reserves from operations in the Wilmington field is subject to contractual arrangements similar to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) that are in effect through the economic life of the assets. Under such contracts we are obligated to fund all capital and production costs.  We record a share of production and reserves to recover such capital and production costs and an additional share for profit.  Our portion of the production represents volumes: (1) to recover our partners  share of capital and production costs that we incur on their behalf, (2) for our share of contractually defined base production and (3) for our share of production in excess of contractually defined base production for each period.  We realize our share of capital and production costs, and generate returns, through our defined share of production from (2) and (3) above.  These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to us and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on our economic interest as defined in the contracts.  Our share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline, however, our net economic benefit is greater when product prices are higher.  The contracts represented slightly less than 20% of our production for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  Fixed and Variable Costs    
  Our total production costs consist of variable costs that tend to vary depending on production levels, and fixed costs that typically do not vary with changes in production levels or well counts, especially in the short term. The substantial majority of our near-term fixed costs become variable over the longer term because we manage them based on the field s stage of life and operating characteristics. For example, portions of labor and material costs, energy, workovers and maintenance expenditures correlate to well count, production and activity levels. Portions of these same costs can be relatively fixed over the near term; however, they are managed down as fields mature in a manner that correlates to production and commodity price levels. While a certain amount of costs for facilities, surface support, surveillance and related maintenance can be regarded as fixed in the early phases of a program, as the production from a certain area matures, well count increases and daily per well production drops, such support costs can be reduced and consolidated over a larger number of wells, reducing costs per operating well.  Further, many of our other costs, such as property taxes and oilfield services, are variable and will respond to activity levels and tend to correlate with commodity prices. Overall, we believe less than one-third of our operating costs are fixed over the life cycle of our fields. We actively manage our fields to optimize production and costs. When we see growth in a field we increase capacities, and similarly when a field nears the end of its economic life we manage the costs while it remains economically viable to produce. 

Financial and Operating Results    
    
  Third Quarter 2016 compared to Third Quarter 2015 

Net income of $546 million reflected a net gain of $660 million on early extinguishment of debt. 
                  
    Realized crude oil prices, including the effect of cash received from settled hedges, decreased 10% from   $47.79   to $43.03 per barrel. 

19 

First Nine Months of 2016 compared to First Nine Months of 2015 

Net income of $356 million reflected a net gain of $793 million on early extinguishment of debt. 
                  
    Realized crude oil prices, including the effect of cash received from settled hedges, decreased 19% from   $50.28    to $40.91 per barrel. 
        
  The table below reconciles net income (loss) to adjusted net loss and presents net and adjusted net loss per diluted share: 

(a) Amount represents the out-of-period portion of the valuation allowance reversal. 
    
  The following table presents the components of our net derivative losses (gains):  

The following table presents the reconciliation of our company-wide general and administrative expenses to adjusted general and administrative expenses: 

20 

Our results of operations can include the effects of non-cash, unusual and infrequent transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing, amount and frequency.  Therefore, management uses measures called adjusted net loss and adjusted general and administrative expenses, both of which exclude those items.  These measures are not meant to disassociate items from management's performance, but rather are meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing our performance between periods.  Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term.  Adjusted net loss and adjusted general and administrative expenses are not considered to be an alternative to net loss or general and administrative expenses, respectively, reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The following table sets forth our average production volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

  _______________________ 
           Note:  
    MBbl/d refers to thousands of barrels per day; MMcf/d refers to millions of cubic feet per day; MBoe/d refers to thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
              (a) 
    Natural gas volumes have been converted to Boe based on the equivalence of energy content between six Mcf of natural gas and one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.  For example, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the average prices of Brent oil and NYMEX natural gas were   $43.01   per barrel and   $2.24   per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil-to-gas ratio of approximately   19   to 1.

Balance Sheet Analysis    
    
  The changes in our balance sheet from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   are discussed below: 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion of changes in our cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt, net.  
    
  The decrease in other current assets was mainly due to a reduction in the value of our derivative assets.  The decrease in property, plant and equipment reflected depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) for the period, partially offset by capital investments.  The decrease in other assets was mainly due to increased valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. 
    
  The decrease in current maturities of long-term debt was due to the prepayments on our existing term loan during 2016.  The decrease in accounts payable reflected lower capital investments and production costs in 2016.  The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the deferral of gains related to sales of greenhouse gas allowances, the change in value of derivative liabilities and accrued interest on our debt, partially offset by the effect of severance and employee bonus payments during the first nine months of 2016.  Current income taxes and other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2015 included $336 million in tax liabilities that have subsequently been reclassified to deferred taxes.  The other long-term liabilities also reflect higher derivative liabilities due to mark-to-market effects.  The decrease in long-term debt reflected the retirement of a portion of our senior unsecured notes and the partial pay down of our bank credit facilities, partially offset by the incurrence of new term loans.  The decrease in deferred gain and issuance costs, net, reflected the amortization of deferred gains and new deferred debt issuance costs, partially offset by the amortization and write-off of existing deferred issuance costs.  The increase in equity primarily reflected the net income for the nine-month period in 2016.

Statement of Operations Analysis    
    
  The following table presents the results of our operations: 

________________________ 
           (a) 
    See "Financial and Operating Results" above for our Non-GAAP reconciliation.  
              (b) 
    We define adjusted EBITDAX consistent with our first lien, first out credit facilities as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; and other non-cash, unusual and infrequent items.  Our management believes adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and it is widely used by the industry and investment community.  The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP.  This measure is a material component of our financial covenants under our first lien, first out credit facilities and is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets.  Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
       
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDAX:

The following presents costs included in our oil and gas operations, excluding certain corporate items, on a per Boe basis for the   three and nine   months ended September 30:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Oil and gas net sales decreased   18%  , or   $96 million  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , due to reductions of approximately $41 million and $50 million from lower oil prices and volumes, respectively; $3 million and $8 million from lower natural gas prices and volumes, respectively; and an increase of $9 million from higher NGL prices.  The lower realized oil prices reflected a significant decrease in global oil prices.  Our realized oil prices in 2016 and 2015 also included $11 million and $15 million of cash generated from our hedging program, respectively.  Daily oil and gas production volumes averaged   138,000   Boe in the   third   quarter of 2016, compared with   158,000   Boe in the   third   quarter of   2015  , representing a   13%   year-over-year decline rate, consistent with our estimated overall annual base decline rate.  The decrease includes PSC effects offset by production deferred from the second quarter of 2016 to the third quarter due to third-party pipeline disruptions.  Average oil production decreased by   13%  , or   13,000   barrels per day, to   90,000   barrels per day in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of the prior year.  NGL production decreased by   11%   to   16,000   barrels per day.  Natural gas production decreased by   15%   to   193   MMcf per day, consistent with our focus on liquids.  The overall   third  -quarter production decline continued to reflect our decision to withhold development capital and selectively defer workover and downhole maintenance activity in the early part of the year.  Due to the improved commodity price environment, we began increasing our activity levels gradually towards the end of the second quarter resulting in lower third-quarter decline rates on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  The higher activity levels began contributing to production more meaningfully towards the end of the third quarter.   
    
  Derivative losses were $14 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to gains of $68 million in the comparable period of 2015.  The change was largely due to volume and valuation changes in our outstanding derivative positions, partially offset by cash settlements. 
    
  Production costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased $  35 million  , to   $211 million   or $  16.63   per Boe, compared to   $246 million   or $  16.91   per Boe for the same period of   2015  , resulting in a   14%   decrease on an absolute dollar basis.  The year-over-year decrease was driven by cost reductions across nearly all of our operations, particularly in well servicing efficiency, lower personnel costs, lower energy use and lower natural gas prices, which also reduced the cost of electricity.  However, the increasing workover and downhole maintenance activity combined with higher gas and seasonal energy prices resulted in higher production costs for the third quarter 2016 compared to the prior-year quarter. 
    
  Our general and administrative expenses were lower for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , on a total dollar and per Boe basis, reflecting continued employee and contractor cost-reduction initiatives.  The three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included severance and early retirement costs of $1 million and $62 million, respectively.  The non-cash portion of general and administrative expenses, comprising equity compensation and a portion of pension costs, was approximately $6 million and $7 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  DD A expense decreased   46%  , or $  116 million  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  .  Of this decrease, approximately $98 million was due to a decrease in the DD A rate that resulted from asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015, and approximately $18 million was attributable to lower volumes.   

25 

Taxes other than on income, which include ad valorem taxes, greenhouse gas emissions costs and production taxes, decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , largely reflecting lower property taxes assessed in the lower price environment.  
    
  Exploration expense decreased   40%  , or   $2 million  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , primarily due to reduced exploration activity. 
    
  Interest and debt expense, net, increased to   $95 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $82 million   in the same period of 2015, due to higher interest rates, increased amortization of deferred financing costs and a $12 million write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with the tender for our notes during the third quarter of 2016.  The increases were partially offset by the amortization of the gain on our fourth quarter 2015 debt exchange and lower debt balances. 
    
  Net gain on early extinguishment of debt primarily consisted of the gains on the tender for our notes, net of related expenses. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , while we had pre-tax income of   $546 million  , we had no income tax expense because we expect a tax loss for 2016 for which no tax benefit has been recognized during the three-month period.  For the same period of   2015  , we had a benefit of   $50 million   and a pre-tax loss of   $154 million  .  
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   2015    
    
  Oil and gas net sales decreased   31%  , or   $530 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , due to reductions of approximately $346 million and $121 million from lower oil prices and volumes, respectively; $39 million and $20 million from lower natural gas prices and volumes, respectively; and $7 million from lower NGL volumes.  The lower realized oil prices reflected a significant decrease in global oil prices.  Our realized prices in 2016 and 2015 also included $86 million and $17 million of cash generated from our hedging program, respectively.  Daily oil and gas production volumes averaged   142,000   Boe in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   161,000   Boe in the same period of   2015   representing a   12%   year-over-year decline rate.  Average oil production decreased by   11%   or   12,000   barrels per day to   93,000   barrels per day in the first   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of the prior year.  NGL production decreased by   11%   to   16,000   barrels per day.  Natural gas production decreased by   16%   to   197   MMcf per day, consistent with our focus on liquids.  
    
  Derivative losses were $157 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to gains of $50 million in the comparable period of 2015.  The change was largely due to volume and valuation changes in our outstanding derivative positions, partially offset by cash settlements. 
    
  Production costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   $147 million   to   $583 million   or   $15.01   per Boe, compared to   $730 million   or   $16.56   per Boe for the same period of   2015  , resulting in a   20%   decrease on an absolute dollar basis.  The decrease was driven by cost reductions across nearly all of our operations, particularly in well servicing efficiency, lower personnel costs, lower energy use and lower natural gas prices, as well as management's decision to increase economic thresholds for capital investment and selectively defer lower value workovers and downhole maintenance activity during the early part of the 2016. 
    
  Our general and administrative expenses were lower for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , on a total dollar and per Boe basis, reflecting continued employee and contractor cost-reduction initiatives.  The   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included severance and early retirement costs of $19 million and $72 million, respectively.  The non-cash portion of general and administrative expenses, comprising equity compensation and a portion of pension costs, was approximately $20 million and $25 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  DD A expense decreased   44%  , or   $335 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  .  Of this decrease, approximately $281 million was due to a decrease in the DD A rate that resulted from asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015, and approximately $54 million was attributable to lower volumes.   
    
  Taxes other than on income decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , reflected lower property taxes assessed in the lower price environment prevailing during the period.  
  
   26 

Exploration expense decreased   55%  , or   $16 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , due to reduced exploration activity and lease rates. 
    
  Interest and debt expense, net, of   $243 million   for the   nine   months ended 2016, compared to   $244 million   in the same period of 2015, reflected the higher interest rates, increased amortization of deferred financing costs and a $12 million write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with the tender for our notes during the third quarter of 2016.  Offsetting these effects were the amortization of the gain on our fourth quarter 2015 debt exchange and lower debt balances. 
    
  Other expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included the $31 million gain on non-core asset divestitures.  Otherwise, the other expenses between the two periods were comparable. 
    
  Net gain on early extinguishment of debt for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from the tender for our notes as well as other note retirements, net of related expenses. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had an income tax benefit of   $78 million   reflecting a change in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.  While we had pre-tax income of   $278 million   for the period, we had no income tax expense during the first nine months of 2016 because we expect a tax loss for 2016 for which no tax benefit has been recognized during the first nine months of 2016.  For the same period of   2015  , we had a benefit of   $165 million   and a pre-tax loss of   $437 million  .  

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
    
  The primary source of liquidity and capital resources to fund our capital program and other obligations has been cash flow from operations. Operating cash flows are largely dependent on oil and natural gas prices, sales volumes and costs.  Average oil prices continued the decline that began in the last half of 2014 into the first quarter of 2016.  While global oil prices improved modestly through the third quarter of 2016 and started to trade in a narrower range, they were still lower in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.  These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas prices could continue to have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. 
    
  Much of the global exploration and production industry is challenged at current price levels, putting pressure on the industry's ability to generate positive cash flow and access capital.  If commodity prices were to prevail through the year at about current levels, we would not anticipate a draw down on our revolving credit facility for our annual cash needs, including our current capital program.  Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is limited by the size of the facility, by our ability to comply with its covenants, including quarterly financial covenants, and by our borrowing base.  Effective November 1, 2016, the borrowing base under our existing first lien first out credit facility was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion.  As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $506 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  If product prices increase at the rate currently projected in the forward strip and we maintain a cost structure similar to current levels, we expect to be able to comply with our senior bank credit facility covenants through the end of the first quarter of 2018 and possibly beyond.  If we were to breach any of our covenants, our lenders would be permitted to accelerate or cross-accelerate the principal amount due under our credit facilities and foreclose on the assets securing them.  If payment were accelerated under our credit facilities, it would result in a default under our outstanding notes and permit acceleration and foreclosure on the assets securing our secured notes. 

27 

At the beginning of the year, in response to commodity price declines, we budgeted $50 million for our 2016 capital program, compared to our 2015 capital investments of $401 million.  In the first half of the year, we further reduced the pace of our capital program to below our initial budget.  Since then and in response to recent commodity price improvements, we have modestly increased our planned 2016 capital investments to approximately $75 million to $80 million.  Our slowdown of drilling activity from late 2015 through the first half of 2016, coupled with the selective deferral of expense and capital workover activity, led to a decline in production in 2016.  However, we began increasing activity levels gradually towards the end of the second quarter, continuing into the third quarter.  We started experiencing the positive impact of the increased activity towards the end of the third quarter, and expect to see further production benefit in the fourth quarter which should reduce the base production decline rate.  We believe our overall annual base decline rate ranges from 10% to 15%.  We cannot guarantee our planned increase in investments will result in a rapid reversal of, or a significant increase in, production trends.  Over the long term, if commodity prices fall again or remain at depressed levels, we may experience continued declines in our production and reserves, which could reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively impacting our cash flow from operations, the value of our assets and our borrowing base. 
    
  We focus on creating value and are committed to internally fund our capital budget with operating cash flows. Our low decline assets plus our high level of operational control and absence of significant long-term drilling commitments give us the flexibility to adjust the level of such capital investments as circumstances warrant.  We create dynamic budgets that can be adjusted to align investments with projected cash flows.  In the event of improved and more consistent prices and cash flow, we may choose to deploy additional capital based on our Value Creation Index (VCI) investment metric, while abiding by our financial covenants. 
    
  We have taken a number of other steps to better align our cost structure with the current price environment including a reduction of our workforce to below 1,500 employees as of September 2016.   As a result of these steps, in 2016, we have seen a reduction in our production costs and general and administrative expense below 2015 levels.   These measures have helped offset some of the cash flow effects of prolonged low commodity prices. 
    
  In January and February 2016, we repurchased over $100 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes for under $13 million in cash.  In May 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with a holder of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 5  % Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock on a post-split basis for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $80 million.  In August 2016, we issued a new $1 billion first lien, second out term loan credit facility (2016 Second Out Credit Agreement) to prepay a portion of our existing term loans and reduce outstanding revolving loans under our first lien, first out credit facility (2014 First Out Credit Facilities).  In October 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and 5 1/2% Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of 1.3 million shares of our common stock for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million.  
    
  Given the state of the commodity markets, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet to competitively position the company for the longer term.  As a result, we may from time to time seek to further reduce our outstanding debt using cash from asset sales or other monetizations, exchanging debt for other debt or equity securities or engaging in joint ventures and other activities.  Such activities, if any, will depend on available funds, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions in our credit facilities, perceived credit risk by counterparties and other factors.  The amounts involved may be material.  However, we can give no assurances that any of these efforts will be successful or adequately strengthen our balance sheet.  

28 

Our strategy for protecting our cash flows and liquidity also includes our hedging program.  We currently have the following Brent-based crude oil and PG E City Gate-based gas hedges: 

Certain of our 2017 crude oil swaps grant our counterparty a quarterly option to increase volumes by up to 10,000 barrels per day for that quarter at a weighted-average Brent price of $55.46. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  The 2014 First Out Credit Facilities comprise a (i)   $671 million   senior term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and (ii) $1.4 billion senior revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility).  We are permitted to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $250 million if we obtain additional commitments from new or existing lenders.  The facility matures at the earlier of November 2019 and the 182nd day prior to the maturity of our 5% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the 2020 notes), to the extent more than $100 million of such notes remain outstanding at such date.  The Revolving Credit Facility includes a sub-limit of $400 million for the issuance of letters of credit. 
    
  As of February 2016, we amended the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities to change certain of our financial and other covenants. We again amended this agreement in April 2016 to facilitate certain types of deleveraging transactions and in August 2016 to further change certain of our covenants, grant additional collateral to our lenders and permit the incurrence of debt under the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the 2014 First Out Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base that was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion as of November 1, 2016.  We have granted the lenders under the  2014 First Out Credit Facilities a first-priority lien in a substantial majority of our assets, including our Elk Hills power plant and midstream assets.  We also granted a lien in the same assets to the lenders under our 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement and the holders of our senior second lien secured notes due in 2022. 

29 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of   $772 million   and $739 million, respectively, and outstanding borrowings of $671 million and $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility, respectively.  We made scheduled quarterly payments on the Term Loan Facility during the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, an $11 million prepayment from the proceeds of non-core asset sales in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and a $250 million prepayment from proceeds of the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement. 
    
  Borrowings under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities bear interest, at our election, at either a LIBOR rate or an alternate base rate (ABR) (equal to the greatest of (i) the administrative agent s prime rate, (ii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% and (iii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%), in each case plus an applicable margin.  This applicable margin is based, while our total leverage ratio exceeds 3.00:1.00, on our borrowing base utilization and will vary from (a) in the case of LIBOR loans, 2.50% to 3.50% and (b) in the case of ABR loans, 1.50% to 2.50%.  The unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility commitments, as limited by the borrowing base, is subject to a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum.  We also pay customary fees and expenses under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities.  Interest on ABR loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of each LIBOR period, but not less than quarterly. 
    
  Our financial performance covenants under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities require that (i) the ratio of our first priority, first out secured debt to trailing four quarter EBITDAX (the First-Lien First-Out Leverage Ratio) not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 at any quarter end through the quarter ending June 30, 2017 and 3.25 to 1.00 for the quarters ending September 30 and December 31, 2017 and (ii) the total interest expense coverage ratio at each quarter end not be less than 1.20 to 1.00 at any quarter end through the quarter ending December 31, 2017.  Starting with the end of the first quarter of 2018, the First-Lien First-Out Leverage Ratio may not exceed 2.25 to 1.00 and the total interest expense coverage ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1.00.   The covenants also include a new first-lien asset coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 as of any June 30 and December 31 beginning December 31, 2016, which is consistent with a covenant included in the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement described below.  
    
  Our 2014 First Out Credit Facilities require us to apply 100% of the proceeds from asset sales to repay loans outstanding under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, except that we are permitted to use up to 40% (or, if our leverage ratio is less than 4:00 to 1:00, 60%) of proceeds from non-borrowing base asset monetizations to repurchase our notes to the extent available at a significant minimum discount to par, as specified in the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities.  The 2014 First Out Credit Facilities also permit us to incur up to an additional $50 million, which may be secured by non-borrowing base assets, subject to compliance with our financial covenants and indentures; the proceeds of which must be applied to repay the Term Loan Facility.   We must apply cash on hand in excess of $150 million daily to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Further, we are restricted from (i) paying dividends or making other distributions to common stockholders and (ii) making capital investments in excess of $125 million during 2016 or in excess of $200 million during 2017 with a carryover of unused 2016 amounts. The amount permitted to be invested can be increased dollar-for-dollar at any time after June 30, 2017  by the lesser of (a) $50 million and (b) the positive difference between (i) a measure of our liquidity as of June 30, 2017 and (ii) the sum of $500 million and net cash proceeds obtained from non-borrowing base asset dispositions. 
    
  Our borrowing base under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities is redetermined each May 1 and November 1.  The borrowing base will be based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserves.  Increases in our borrowing base require approval of at least 80% of our revolving lenders, as measured by exposure, while decreases or affirmations require a two-thirds approval.  We and the lenders (requiring a request from the lenders holding two-thirds of the revolving commitments and outstanding loans) each may request a special redetermination once in any period between three consecutive scheduled redeterminations.  We will be permitted to have collateral released when both (i) our credit ratings are at least Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S P, in each case with a stable or better outlook, and (ii) certain permitted liens securing other debt are released. 
    
  Substantially all of the restrictions imposed by the February 2016 amendment to the Credit Facilities, other than the requirement for semiannual borrowing base redeterminations, may terminate in the future if we are able to comply with the financial covenants as they existed prior to giving effect to the amendment.

The net borrowings under the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement were used to (i) prepay $250 million of the Term Loan Facility and (ii) reduce our Revolving Credit Facility by $740 million.   The proceeds received were net of a $10 million original issue discount.  The term loans bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to 10.375% plus LIBOR, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, determined for the applicable interest period (or ABR rates in certain circumstances).  Interest on ABR loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of each LIBOR period, but not less than quarterly. 
    
  The 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in the same collateral used to secure the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, but, under intercreditor arrangements with our 2014 First Out Credit Facilities lenders, are second in collateral recovery behind such lenders.  Prepayment of the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement is subject to a make-whole premium prior to the third anniversary of closing and a premium to par equal to 50% of coupon between the third anniversary and the fourth anniversary.  Following the fourth anniversary, we may redeem at par.  The 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement matures on December 31, 2021, but if the aggregate principal amount outstanding of either our 2020 Notes or our 5 % senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2021 (the 2021 Notes) exceeds $100 million 91 days prior to their respective maturity dates, the maturity date of the term loans will accelerate to such prior 91st day.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   $193 million   and   $149 million   in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2020 notes and 2021 notes, respectively. 
    
  The 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement provides for customary covenants and events of default consistent with, or generally less restrictive than, the covenants in our 2014 First Out Credit Facilities, including limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, asset dispositions, investments, restricted payments and other negative covenants, in each case subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  Additionally, the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a first-lien asset coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 as of any June 30 and December 31 beginning December 31, 2016, consistent with the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities. 
    
  All obligations under the 2014 First Out Credit Facilities and the 2016 Second Out Credit Agreement (Credit Facilities) are guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our material wholly owned subsidiaries.  The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries not guaranteeing the debt are de minimis. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants under our Credit Facilities.  
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  In October 2014, we issued $5.00 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes, including $1.00 billion of 2020 notes, $1.75 billion of 2021 notes and $2.25 billion of 6% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2024 (the 2024 notes and together with the 2020 notes and the 2021 notes, the unsecured notes). The unsecured notes were issued at par and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our material subsidiaries. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured notes to make a $4.95 billion cash distribution to Occidental in October 2014. 
    
  In December 2015, we exchanged $534 million, $921 million and $1,358 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 notes, the 2021 notes, and the 2024 notes, respectively, for $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 8% senior secured second lien notes due December 15, 2022 (the 2022 notes).  We recorded a deferred gain of approximately $560 million on the debt exchange, which will be amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the 2022 notes.  Additionally, we incurred approximately $28 million in third-party costs which were fully expensed in 2015.  Our 2022 notes are secured on a second-priority basis, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement and collateral trust agreement, by a lien on the same collateral used to secure our obligations under our Credit Facilities. 
    
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased over $100 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes for under $13 million in cash.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with a holder of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 5  % Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock on a post-split basis for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $80 million.   

31 

In August 2016, we repurchased $197 million, $605 million and $613 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 notes, 2021 notes and 2024 notes, respectively, for $750 million using our Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in a $660 million pre-tax gain, net of related expenses.  These repurchases resulted in a net reduction of our debt of $625 million.  Additionally, we wrote off approximately $12 million of deferred costs related to the repurchased notes.  
    
  In October 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and 5 1/2% Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a total of 1.3 million shares of our common stock for notes in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million.  
    
  We will pay interest semiannually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 for the 2020 notes, on March 15 and September 15 for the 2021 notes, on June 15 and December 15 for the 2022 notes and on May 15 and November 15 for the 2024 notes.  
    
  The indentures governing the senior unsecured notes and the second lien secured notes each include covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries  ability to incur debt secured by liens.  The indentures also restrict our ability to merge or consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, another entity.  These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations that are set forth in the indenture.  The covenants are not, however, directly linked to measures of our financial performance.  In addition, if we experience a  change of control triggering event  (as defined in the indentures) with respect to a series of notes, we will be required, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series, to offer to purchase the notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  The indenture governing our second lien secured notes also restricts our ability to sell certain assets and to release collateral from liens securing the second lien secured notes, unless the collateral is released in compliance with our Credit Facilities. 
    
  Other 
    
  A one-eighth percent change in the variable interest rates on the borrowings under our Credit Facilities on   September 30, 2016  , would result in a   $3 million   change in annual interest expense.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately   $127 million   and $70 million (including   $122 million   and $49 million under the Revolving Credit Facility), respectively, which were issued to support ordinary course marketing, insurance, regulatory and other matters.  

Cash Flow Analysis   

  _______________________________ 
           (a) 
    We define adjusted EBITDAX consistent with our first lien, first out credit facilities as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; and other non-cash, unusual and infrequent items.  Our management believes adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and it is widely used by the industry and investment community.  The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP.  This measure is a material component of our financial covenants under our first lien, first out credit facilities and is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets.  Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

32 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDAX:         

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $  145 million   and   $412 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The first nine months of 2016, as compared with the same period in 2015, reflected lower revenues of $466 million, primarily due to lower commodity prices and volumes, net of cash 
  generated from our hedging program, partially offset by lower production costs of $147 million, the cash portion of general and administrative expenses of $46 million and taxes other than on income of $32 million as well as the negative effect of working capital changes.  
    
  Our net cash flow used by investing activities decreased   $511 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , primarily due to significantly lower capital investments and lower payments related to capital activity from prior periods. 
    
  Our net cash flow used by financing activities of   $116 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately $33 million in net proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility, $329 million in payments on the Term Loan Facility and $814 million in debt repurchases and other costs.  Our net cash flow provided by financing activities of   $120 million   for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $121 million in net proceeds on the Revolving Credit Facility.   

2016 Capital Program    
    
  At the beginning of the year, we budgeted $50 million for our 2016 capital program, primarily to maintain the mechanical integrity of our facilities and systems and operate them safely.  In the first half of the year, we further reduced the pace of our capital program to below our initial budget.  Since then and in response to recent commodity price improvements, we have modestly increased our planned 2016 capital investments to approximately $75 million to $80 million.  Our slowdown of drilling activity from late 2015 through the first half of 2016, coupled with the selective deferral of expense and capital workover activity, led to a decline in production in 2016.  However, we began increasing activity levels gradually towards the end of the second quarter, continuing in to the third quarter.  We started experiencing the positive impact of the increased capital activity towards the end of the third quarter, and expect to see further production benefit in the fourth quarter which should reduce the base production decline rate.  We believe our overall annual base decline rate ranges from 10% to 15%.  We cannot guarantee our planned increase in investments will result in a rapid reversal of, or a significant increase in, production trends.  Over the long term, if commodity prices fall again or remain at depressed levels, we may experience continued declines in our production and reserves, which could reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively impacting our cash flow from operations, the value of our assets and our borrowing base. 
    
  We focus on creating value and are committed to internally fund our capital budget with operating cash flows. Our low decline assets plus our high level of operational control and absence of significant long-term drilling commitments give us the flexibility to adjust the level of such capital investments as circumstances warrant.  We create dynamic budgets that can be adjusted to align investments with projected cash flows.  In the event of improved and more consistent prices and cash flow, we may choose to deploy additional capital based on our VCI investment metric, while abiding by our financial covenants. 

33 

Lawsuits, Claims, Contingencies and Commitments    
    
  We, or certain of our subsidiaries, are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, environmental and other claims and other contingencies that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.   
    
  On April 21, 2016, a purported class action was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all beneficial owners of our unsecured notes from November 12, 2015 to the present.  The complaint alleges that our December 2015 debt exchange excluded non-qualified institutional holders in violation of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and related law and, thereby, impaired their rights to receive principal and interest payments.  The purported class action seeks declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens securing the new notes are null and void and that the debt exchange resulted in a default.  The plaintiff also seeks monetary damages and attorneys  fees.  We plan to vigorously defend against the claims made by the plaintiff. 
    
  We accrue reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.  Reserves balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were not material to our balance sheets as of such dates.  We also evaluate the amount of reasonably possible losses that we could incur as a result of these matters.  We believe that reasonably possible losses that we could incur in excess of reserves accrued on our balance sheet would not be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  We, our subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specific liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with the Spin-off, purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with us.  These indemnities include indemnities made to Occidental against certain tax-related liabilities that may be incurred by Occidental relating to the Spin-off and liabilities related to operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we are not aware of material indemnity claims pending or threatened against us. 
    
  We were contacted by the Internal Revenue Service for examination of our U.S. federal income tax return for the one month ended December 2014.  Subsequent taxable years and state returns remain subject to examination. 

Significant Accounting and Disclosure Changes    
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules that modify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued rules that change how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value.  These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued rules intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. These rules have the same effective date, generally in the first interim period of fiscal year 2018, as the related revenue standard issued in 2014.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months and to include qualitative and quantitative disclosures with respect to the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These rules will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 
  
   34 

In January 2016, the FASB issued rules that modify how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities.  Unless the investments qualify for a practicality exception, the new rules require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee).  Entities will have to record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option in other comprehensive income.  These new rules become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with no early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules, but we do not expect them to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
   
  Safe Harbor Statement Regarding Outlook and Forward-Looking Information    
    
  The information in this document includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Such statements specifically include our expectations as to our future financial position, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations and business prospects, budgets, drilling and workover program, maintenance capital, projected production, projected costs, future operations, hedging activities, future transactions, planned capital investments and other guidance.  Actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially, and reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance.  You can typically identify forward-looking statements by words such as aim, anticipate, believe, budget, continue, could, effort, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, guidance, intend, likely, may, might, objective, outlook, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, target, will or would and other similar words that reflect the prospective nature of events or outcomes.  For any such forward-looking statement that includes a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying such forward-looking statement, we caution that, while we believe such assumptions or bases to be reasonable and make them in good faith, assumed facts or bases almost always vary from actual results, sometimes materially.  Material risks that may affect our results of operations and financial position appear in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  Factors (but not necessarily all the factors) that could cause results to differ include: commodity price fluctuations; the ability of our lenders to limit our borrowing capacity; other liquidity constraints; the effect of our debt on our financial flexibility; limitations on our ability to enter efficient hedging transactions; insufficiency of our operating cash flow to fund planned capital expenditures; steeper than expected production decline rates; inability to implement our capital investment program; inability to replace reserves; inability to obtain government permits and approvals; inability to monetize selected assets; restrictions and changes in restrictions imposed by regulations including those related to our ability to obtain, use, manage or dispose of water or use advanced well stimulation techniques like hydraulic fracturing; risks of drilling; tax law changes; competition with larger, better funded competitors for and costs of oilfield equipment, services, qualified personnel and acquisitions; the subjective nature of estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows; risks related to our disposition and acquisition activities; restriction of operations to, and concentration of exposure to events such as industrial accidents, natural disasters and labor difficulties in, California; the recoverability of resources; concerns about climate change and air quality issues; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; catastrophic events for which we may be uninsured or underinsured; the effects of litigation; cyber attacks; operational issues that restrict market access; and uncertainties related to the Spin-off and the agreements related thereto.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no responsibility to publicly release the result of any revision of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made. 
    
  All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
       
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes in the information required to be provided under Item 305 of Regulation S-K included under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Incorporating Item 7A) - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the 2015 Form 10-K, except as discussed below.  
  Commodity Price Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had derivative assets of $31 million and derivative liabilities of $128 million carried at fair value, as determined from prices provided by external sources that are not actively quoted, which mature in 2016 through 2018.   See additional hedging information in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources." 
    
  Credit Risk 
  Our credit risk relates primarily to trade receivables and derivative financial instruments.  Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances and current activity.  For derivative swaps and options entered into as part of our hedging program, we are subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty is unable to meet its settlement commitments.  We actively manage this credit risk by selecting counterparties that we believe to be financially strong and continuing to monitor their financial health.  Concentration of credit risk is regularly reviewed to ensure that counterparty credit risk is adequately diversified. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the substantial majority of the credit exposures related to our business was with investment grade counterparties.  We believe exposure to credit-related losses related to our business at   September 30, 2016   was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented. 

Item 4. 
       Controls and Procedures    
       
  Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the   third   quarter of   2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  [FORM OF] 
  NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTION AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
    
           DATE OF GRANT: 
    [ ] 
     SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
           SUBJECT TO THIS OPTION: 
    See Morgan Stanley Stock Plan Connect  Stock Options /Granted  
              VESTING SCHEDULE: 
    Zero prior to the day immediately preceding the first anniversary of the Date of Grant;   on the day immediately preceding the first anniversary of the Date of Grant; an additional   on the day immediately preceding the second anniversary of the Date of Grant; and an additional   on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (each such day being a    Vesting Date   ) 
              PURCHASE PRICE PER SHARE: 
    See Morgan Stanley Stock Plan Connect  Stock Options /Grant Price  
     The following Terms and Conditions (these    Terms and Conditions   ) are set forth as of the Date of Grant between CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (   CRC    and, with its subsidiaries, the    Company   ), and the eligible employee receiving this award (the    Grantee   ). 
  1.      Grant of Option  .  In accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the California Resources Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the    Plan   ), CRC hereby grants to the Grantee the right and option (   Option   ) to purchase all or any part of the aggregate number of shares of CRC common stock, $0.01 par value (   Common Stock   ), set forth above.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of these Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Plan shall control.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Terms and Conditions shall have the meanings attributed to such terms under the Plan, unless the context requires otherwise.  This Option shall not be treated as an incentive stock option within the meaning of section 422(b) of the Code. 
  If the Grantee fails to accept this award prior to the next record date for the payment of dividends on the Common Stock subsequent to the Date of Grant, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this award, the Grantee shall forfeit this Option and all rights under this award and this award will become null and void. For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, acceptance of the award shall occur on the date the Grantee accepts this Nonstatutory Stock Option Award through Morgan Stanley Stock Plan Connect or any replacement on-line system designated by the Company. 
  
   1 

2.        Purchase Price  .  The purchase price of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of this Option shall be the purchase price per share set forth above, which has been determined to be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the Date of Grant.  For all purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
  3.        Vesting and Exercise of Option  .  Subject to the earlier expiration of this Option as herein provided, this Option may be exercised, by written notice to CRC at its principal executive office addressed to the attention of its corporate secretary (or such other officer, employee or designee of the Company as CRC may designate from time to time), at any time and from time to time after the Date of Grant, but, except as otherwise provided below, this Option shall not be exercisable for more than that portion of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock offered by this Option determined under the vesting schedule set forth above. 
  This Option may be exercised only while the Grantee remains an employee of the Company and will terminate and cease to be exercisable upon the Grantee s termination of employment with the Company, except that: 
    
  (a)  If, prior to the final Vesting Date, the Grantee dies, becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and terminates employment as a result thereof, or retires with the consent of the Company (each of the foregoing, a    Forfeiture Event   ), then the unvested portion of this Option shall become vested and exercisable with respect to such unvested shares of Common Stock offered by this Option as of the date of the Forfeiture Event (and shall remain exercisable for the remaining term of this Option with respect to such shares as well as the shares with respect to which this Option became vested and exercisable prior to the Forfeiture Event). If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or the Grantee s employment is terminated for cause (as determined by the Company) before the final Vesting Date, then (i) the Grantee shall forfeit the portion of this Option that has not become vested and exercisable prior to the Grantee s termination date and (ii) this Option may be exercised by the Grantee (or the person who acquires this Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise by reason of the death of  Grantee) at any time during the period ending at the earlier 60 days following such termination or the term of this Option, but only as to the number of shares the Grantee was entitled to purchase hereunder as of the date the Grantee s employment so terminates.    
  (b)  If a Change in Control occurs prior to the final Vesting Date and the Grantee s employment is terminated by the Company on or after the date of such event and as a result of such event, then this Option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination of employment (and shall remain exercisable for the remaining term of this Option) unless, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control, the Committee, as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan, determines that such event will not accelerate the vesting and exercisability of this Option. Any such determination by the Committee is binding on the Grantee. 
  
   2 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will this Option be exercisable after the expiration of seven years from the Date of Grant.  The purchase price of shares as to which this Option is exercised shall be paid in full at the time of exercise (i) in cash, cash equivalent, or by electronic funds transfer, (ii) if permitted by the Committee in its sole discretion, by delivering or constructively tendering to CRC shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the purchase price (provided such shares used for this purpose must have been held by the Grantee for such minimum period of time as may be established from time to time by the Committee), (iii) if the Common Stock is readily tradable on a national securities exchange, through a  cashless exercise  in accordance with a Company established policy or program for the same, or (iv) in any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate.  No fraction of a share of Common Stock shall be issued by CRC upon exercise of an Option or accepted by CRC in payment of the exercise price thereof; rather, the Grantee shall provide a cash payment for such amount as is necessary to effect the issuance and acceptance of only whole shares of Common Stock.  Unless and until a certificate or certificates representing such shares shall have been issued by CRC to the Grantee, the Grantee (or the person permitted to exercise this Option in the event of the Grantee s death) shall not be or have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of CRC with respect to shares acquirable upon an exercise of this Option. 
  
   3 

4.        Taxes and Withholding  .  Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (   Tax-Related Items   ), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company. The Grantee further acknowledges that the Company (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this Nonstatutory Stock Option Award, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Nonstatutory Stock Option Award; and (ii) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Nonstatutory Stock Option Award to reduce or eliminate the Grantee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  Prior to the relevant taxable event, the Grantee shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Grantee, first, from the shares purchased upon exercise of this Nonstatutory Stock Option Award and, if not sufficient, from the Grantee s wages or other cash compensation. The Grantee shall pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be required to withhold as a result of the Grantee s receipt, vesting or exercise of this Nonstatutory Stock Option Award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. 
  5.        Status of Common Stock  .  CRC intends to register for issuance under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the    Act   ) the shares of Common Stock acquirable upon exercise of this Option, and to keep such registration effective throughout the period this Option is exercisable.  In the absence of such effective registration or an available exemption from registration under the Act, issuance of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon exercise of this Option will be delayed until registration of such shares is effective or an exemption from registration under the Act is available.  CRC intends to use its reasonable efforts to ensure that no such delay will occur.  In the event exemption from registration under the Act is available upon an exercise of this Option, the Grantee (or the person permitted to exercise this Option in the event of the Grantee s death or incapacity), if requested by the Company to do so, will execute and deliver to the Company in writing an agreement containing such provisions as the Company may require to assure compliance with applicable securities laws. 
  
   4 

The Grantee agrees that the shares of Common Stock which the Grantee may acquire by exercising this Option will not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner which would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws.  The Grantee also agrees that (i) the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock purchased under this Option may bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to assure compliance with applicable securities laws, (ii) CRC may refuse to register the transfer of the shares of Common Stock purchased under this Option on the stock transfer records of CRC if such proposed transfer would in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to CRC constitute a violation of any applicable securities law, and (iii) CRC may give related instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of the shares of Common Stock purchased under this Option. 
  6.        Compensation Recoupment  .    Grantee s receipt of this award is expressly conditioned on Grantee s agreement to the terms and provisions of this Section, and Grantee acknowledges that Grantee would not have received this award in the absence of such agreement.  By accepting this award, Grantee acknowledges and agrees that: 
  (a)    the compensation (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant to this award and any other award granted to Grantee under the Plan (whether granted before, on or after the Date of Grant) shall be subject to recovery, revocation, recoupment or  clawback  by the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to (i) the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the    Act   ), (ii) any rules or regulations promulgated under the Act or by any stock exchange on which the Company s common stock is listed (collectively, the    Rules   ), or (iii) any compensation recoupment or clawback policies or procedures adopted by CRC or any of its Affiliates, in each case with respect to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above as such provisions, rules, regulations, policies and procedures may be adopted and amended from time to time (including with retroactive effect); and 
  (b)    any other compensation or benefit (or any portion thereof) payable to or on behalf of Grantee from the Company or any of its Affiliates (whether payable before, on or after the Date of Grant, but excluding any compensation or benefit payable pursuant to an award granted under the Plan) shall be subject to recovery, revocation, recoupment or clawback by the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the Act, the Rules or any compensation recoupment or clawback policies or procedures adopted by CRC or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the Rules, in each case as the Act, the Rules and such policies and procedures may be adopted and amended from time to time (including with retroactive effect).

EXHIBIT 10.6 

CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION  
    
  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
  [FORM OF] 
  PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARD   TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
            Target Incentive Amount: 
    See Fidelity NetBenefits  CRC Performance Incentive  
      The following Terms and Conditions (these    Terms and Conditions   ) are set forth as of the Date of Grant between CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (   CRC    and, with its subsidiaries, the    Company   ), and the eligible employee receiving this award (the    Grantee   ). 
  1.        Grant of Performance Incentive Award  .  In accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the California Resources Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the    Plan   ), CRC grants, subject to Section 7, to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, up to 200% of the Target Incentive Amount set forth above, subject to adjustment under the Plan and Section 6 of these Terms and Conditions.  
  2.        Restrictions on Transfer  .  Neither these Terms and Conditions nor any right to receive cash pursuant to these Terms and Conditions may be transferred or assigned by the Grantee other than (i) to a beneficiary designated on a form approved by the Company (if enforceable under local law), by will or, if the Grantee dies without designating a beneficiary of a valid will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) pursuant to any applicable domestic relations order (if approved or ratified by the Committee). 
  3.        Performance Goal.    The   Performance Goal   is specified in Exhibit 1. 
  4.        Vesting and Forfeiture of Performance Incentive Award  .   
  (a)        If the Grantee fails to accept this award prior to November 30, 2016, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this award, the Grantee shall forfeit this award and all rights under this award and this award will become null and void. For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, acceptance of the award shall occur on the date the Grantee accepts this Performance Incentive Award through Fidelity NetBenefits or any replacement on-line system designated by the Company. 
  
   1 

(b)        The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the Vesting Date to receive payment under this award. The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantee s employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence.  However, if the Grantee dies or becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and terminates employment as a result thereof, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment without cause (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a    Forfeiture Event   ), then the Target Incentive Amount will be reduced on a pro rata basis to the amount obtained by multiplying the Target Incentive Amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days between and including the Date of Grant and the Forfeiture Event, and the denominator of which is the number of days between and including the Date of Grant and the Vesting Date. If the Forfeiture Event is death or permanent disability, such pro rata unvested Target Incentive Amount shall vest as of the date (the    Unscheduled Vesting Date   )     of the Forfeiture Event and, subject to Section 21 of these Terms and Conditions, become immediately payable. If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or the Grantee s employment is terminated for cause (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), then the Grantee shall forfeit this award and all remaining rights hereunder and this award will become null and void. 
  (c)        Subject to satisfaction of these Terms and Conditions including Section 4(d), the Grantee shall have the right to receive payment of this award in cash in an amount equal to the product of the Target Incentive Amount, as adjusted under Section 4(b), multiplied by the Performance Payout Factor as determined in Exhibit 1, which right shall be based on, and become nonforfeitable upon, the Committee s certification of the attainment of the Performance Goal. 
  (d)        If a Change in Control occurs prior to the Vesting Date and the Grantee s employment is terminated by the Company (or its successor) on or after the date of such event and as a result of such event (a    CIC Event   ), then the Grantee shall have the right to receive payment of this award in an amount equal to the Target Incentive Amount multiplied by the Performance Payout Factor as determined in Exhibit 1, unless, prior to the occurrence of the CIC Event, the Committee, as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan, decides in its sole discretion that such event will not accelerate vesting of the Target Incentive Amount. Any such decision by the Committee is binding on the Grantee.  Any such vesting due to a CIC Event shall be in lieu of payment of this award under Section 4(c). 
  5.        Payment of Awards  .  Payment for vested Target Incentive Amount, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 of these Terms and Conditions, will be made in the form of cash.  Payment will be made to the Grantee as promptly as practicable after the Committee s certification of attainment of the Performance Goal, CIC Event, or Unscheduled Vesting Date, as the case may be, and in any event no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  
  
   2 

6.        Adjustments  .  The Committee may adjust the Performance Goal or other features of this award as permitted by Section 5.2.1 of the Plan. 
  7.        Compensation Recoupment.    The Grantee s receipt of this award is expressly conditioned on the Grantee s agreement to the terms and provisions of this Section, and the Grantee acknowledges that the Grantee would not have received this award in the absence of such agreement.  By accepting this award, the Grantee acknowledges and agrees that: 
  (a)    the compensation (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant to this award and any other award granted to the Grantee under the Plan (whether granted before, on or after the Date of Grant) shall be subject to recovery, revocation, recoupment or  clawback  by the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to (i) the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the    Act   ), (ii) any rules or regulations promulgated under the Act or by any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed (collectively, the    Rules   ), or (iii) any compensation recoupment or clawback policies or procedures adopted by the Company or any of its Affiliates, in each case with respect to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above as such provisions, rules, regulations, policies and procedures may be adopted and amended from time to time (including with retroactive effect); and 
  (b)    any other compensation or benefit (or any portion thereof) payable to or on behalf of the Grantee from the Company or any of its Affiliates (whether payable before, on or after the Date of Grant, but excluding any compensation or benefit payable pursuant to an award granted under the Plan) shall be subject to recovery, revocation, recoupment or clawback by the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the Act, the Rules or any compensation recoupment or clawback policies or procedures adopted by the Company or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the Rules, in each case as the Act, the Rules and such policies and procedures may be adopted and amended from time to time (including with retroactive effect). 
  In addition, the Grantee hereby agrees (on behalf of the Grantee and any other individual, entity or other person claiming under or through the Grantee) that: (a) compensation payable pursuant to this award and any other compensation or benefit payable to or on behalf of the Grantee (whether under the Plan or otherwise) shall be subject to recovery, revocation, recoupment or clawback as provided in the preceding provisions of this Section; and (b) the Grantee (or any such individual, entity or other person) shall not seek indemnification or contribution from the Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to any amount so recovered, revoked, recouped or clawed back. 
    
  8.        No Employment Contract  .  Nothing in these Terms and Conditions confers upon the Grantee any right with respect to continued employment by the Company, nor limits in any manner the right of the Company to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of the Grantee. Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by the Grantee and an authorized representative of the Company, the Grantee s employment with the Company is at will and may be terminated at any time by the Grantee or the Company.  For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the Grantee shall be considered to be in the employment of the Company as long as the Grantee remains an employee of any of the Company, an Affiliate, or a corporation or other entity or a parent or subsidiary  
  
   3 

of such corporation or other entity assuming, or that provides a new award in substitution for, this award.  Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, it is expressly provided that the Grantee shall be considered to have terminated employment with the Company at the time of the termination of the  Affiliate  status under the Plan of the entity or other organization that employs the Grantee. 
  9.        Taxes and Withholding  .  Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (   Tax-Related Items   ), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company. The Grantee further acknowledges that the Company (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this Performance Incentive Award, including the grant or vesting of the Performance Incentive Award; and (ii) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Performance Incentive Award to reduce or eliminate the Grantee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  Prior to the relevant taxable event, the Grantee shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. To facilitate compliance with this obligation, the Grantee authorizes the Company to, and, unless the Committee instructs the Company otherwise, the Company shall, withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Grantee first from the cash payable pursuant to this Performance Incentive Award and, if not sufficient, from the Grantee s wages or other cash compensation. The Grantee shall pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be required to withhold as a result of the Grantee s receipt of this Performance Incentive Award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. 
  10.        Compliance with Law  .  The Company will make reasonable efforts to comply with all federal, state and non-U.S. laws applicable to awards of this type. However, if it is not feasible for the Company to comply with these laws with respect to the grant or settlement of these awards, then the awards may be cancelled without any compensation or additional benefits provided to the Grantee as a result of the cancellation. 
  11.        Relation to Other Benefits  .  The benefits received by the Grantee under these Terms and Conditions will not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Grantee may be entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company, including the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary of the Grantee under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company. Additionally, this Performance Incentive Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses or long-service awards. The grant of this Performance Incentive Award does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance  
  
   4 

Incentive Awards or benefits in lieu of Performance Incentive Awards, even if the Grantee has a history of receiving Performance Incentive Awards or other cash or stock awards. 
  12.        Amendments  .  The Plan may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Board at any time, as provided in the Plan. Any amendment to the Plan will be deemed to be an amendment to these Terms and Conditions to the extent it is applicable to these Terms and Conditions; however, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, no amendment will adversely affect the rights of the Grantee under these Terms and Conditions in any material respect without the Grantee s consent. 
  13.        Severability  .  If one or more of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidated provisions shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions will continue to be valid and fully enforceable. 
  14.        Entire Agreement; Relation to Plan; Interpretation  .  Except as specifically provided in this Section, these Terms and Conditions and the Attachments incorporated in these Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the Company and the Grantee with respect to this Performance Incentive Award;   provided  ,   however  , that the terms of these Terms and Conditions shall not modify and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any employment and/or severance agreement between the Company (or an Affiliate) and the Grantee in effect as of the date a determination is to be made under these Terms and Conditions.  Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, except as provided therein, all prior understandings and agreements, if any, among the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect.  These Terms and Conditions are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. In the event of any inconsistent provisions between these Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan control. Capitalized terms used in these Terms and Conditions without definitions have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. References to Sections and Attachments are to Sections of, and Attachments incorporated in, these Terms and Conditions unless otherwise noted. 
  15.        Successors and Assigns  .  Subject to Sections 2 and 4, the provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall be for the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns of the Grantee, and the successors and assigns of the Company. 
  16.        Governing Law  .  The laws of the State of Delaware govern the interpretation, performance, and enforcement of these Terms and Conditions. 
  17.        Notices  .  Any notices or other communications provided for in these Terms and Conditions shall be sufficient if in writing.  In the case of the Grantee, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if hand delivered to the Grantee at the Grantee s principal place of employment or if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Grantee at the last address the Grantee has filed with the Company.  In the case of the Company, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to CRC at its principal executive offices.

   7 

22.        Compliance with Section 409A of the Code  .  All amounts payable under these Terms and Conditions are intended to comply with the    short term deferral    exception from Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (   Section 409A   ) specified in Treas.

Attachment 1 
  General Terms of Employment 
    
  A.            Except as otherwise required by law or legal process, the Grantee will not publish or divulge to any person, firm, corporation or institution and will not use to the detriment of CRC, or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or stockholders (collectively,    CRC Parties   ), at any time during or after the Grantee s employment by any of them, any trade secrets or confidential information of any of them (whether generated by them or as a result of any of their business relationships), including such information as described in CRC s ethics code and other corporate policies, without first obtaining the written permission of a CRC officer. 
  B.            At the time of terminating employment with the Company, the Grantee will deliver to the Company, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all credit cards, drawings, blueprints, specifications, devices, notes, notebooks, memoranda, reports, studies, correspondence and other documents, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the CRC Parties (whether generated by them or as a result of their business relationships), including any copies (whether in paper or electronic form), that the Grantee has in the Grantee s possession or control. 
  C.            The Grantee will, during the Grantee s employment by the Company, comply with the provisions of CRC s ethics code and other policies. 
  D.            Except as otherwise required by the Grantee s job or permitted by law, the Grantee will not make statements about any CRC Parties (1) to the press, electronic media, to any part of the investment community, to the public, or to any person connected with, employed by or having a relationship with any of them without permission of a CRC officer or (2) that are derogatory, defamatory or negative. Nothing herein, however, shall prevent Grantee from making a good faith report or complaint to appropriate governmental authorities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantee will not interfere with or disrupt any of the Company s operations or otherwise take actions intended directly to harm any of the CRC Parties. 
  E.            All inventions, developments, designs, improvements, discoveries and ideas that the Grantee makes or conceives in the course of employment by the Company, whether or not during regular working hours, relating to any design, article of manufacture, machine, apparatus, process, method, composition of matter, product or any improvement or component thereof, that are manufactured, sold, leased, used or under development by, or pertain to the present or possible future business of the Company shall be works-for-hire and become and remain the property of CRC, its successors and assigns. 
  
   9 

The provisions of this Section do not apply to an invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which provides in substance that provisions in an employment agreement providing that an employee shall assign or offer to assign rights in an invention to his or her employer do not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee s own time, except for those inventions that either (a) relate, at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention, (1) to the business of the employer or (2) to the employer s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. 
  F.            The foregoing General Terms of Employment are not intended to be an exclusive list of the employment terms and conditions that apply to the Grantee. The Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time amend or supplement the foregoing terms. The Grantee s breach of the foregoing General Terms of Employment will entitle the Company to take appropriate disciplinary action, including, without limitation, reduction of the Performance Incentive Award granted pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and termination of employment.

EXHIBIT 1 
    
  Performance Goal 
  The   Performance Goal   is based 50% on Cost per BOE (combined Production Costs and General and Administrative Expenses per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE)) and 50% on Value Creation Index (VCI), as described below. 
    
  The   Performance Payout Factor   shall be determined by the following formula: 
  (Cost per BOE Performance Factor + VCI Performance Factor) / 2 
    
  Cost per BOE Performance Factor 
  The Cost per BOE Performance Factor shall be determined by the following scale: 

(1)   Change in CRC Cost per BOE   is the percentage change in CRC s Average Cost per BOE for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 compared to CRC s Cost per BOE for the year 2015.   
    
  CRC s Average Cost per BOE   is the weighted average of CRC s Cost per BOE for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, weighted by CRC s production for each year.   
    
  CRC s Cost per BOE   is the sum of the i) Production Costs and ii) General and Administrative Expenses, both measured on a per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis for the applicable period.  The Production Costs and General and Administrative Expenses shall be adjusted to reflect all cash-settled equity-based long-term incentive awards being accounted for as equity-settled awards based on the stock price on the award grant date.  
    
   (2)   Change in Peer Group Cost per BOE   is the percentage change in the Peer Group Average Cost per BOE for 2016, 2017 and 2018 compared to the Peer Group Average Cost per BOE for 2015.    
    
  Peer Group Average Cost per BOE     for 2015   is the average of the Peer Company Cost per BOE for the Peer Group for the year 2015. 

11 

Peer Group Average Cost per BOE for 2016, 2017 and 2018   is the average of the Peer Company Cost per BOE for 2016, 2017 and 2018 for the Peer Group. 
    
  Peer Company Cost per BOE   is, for each Peer Company, the sum of the i) Production Costs and ii) General and Administrative Expenses for the applicable Peer Company, both measured on a per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis for the applicable year.  The Production Costs and General and Administrative Expenses shall be calculated using assumptions and methodology approved by the Executive Compensation Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee at the time the Performance Goal was approved.  
    
  Peer Company Cost per BOE for 2016, 2017 and 2018   is, for each Peer Company, the weighted-average of the Peer Company Cost per BOE for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, weighted by the Peer Company s production for each year. 
    
  Peer Group shall consist of:  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, BP p.l.c., Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy Inc., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Denbury Resources Inc., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Husky Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Limited, Marathon Oil Company, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell pic, Suncor Energy Inc. (collectively, the    Peer Group    and individually, a    Peer Company    provided however, that consistent with Section 162(m), if at any time during the Performance Period, a Peer Company is acquired, then such company will be removed and treated as if it had never been a Peer Company and the Cost per BOE Performance Factor will be determined with respect to the remaining Peer Group as set forth above. 
   (3)   Cost per BOE Performance Factor   shall be linearly interpolated between indicated values for results between values indicated in table.         
    
  VCI Performance Factor 
  The VCI Performance Factor shall be determined according to the following scale: 

(1)   Cumulative Value Creation Index   shall be calculated as the weighted average of the Value Creation Index results for the full calendar years 2016, 2017, and 2018, weighted based on discounted capital invested for the plan year.  Value Creation Index is the present value added per discounted dollar of investment, calculated as A divided by B where  A  is the discounted expected future revenue from production of reserves added during the plan year net of production operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, but before any general and administrative charges and income taxes, and  B  is the discounted capital invested for the  
  
   12 

plan year.  The future revenue calculations will be based on the five-year Brent strip (including impact of any hedges), with prices held stable after five years.  Discounting shall be at 10% (consistent with SEC requirements).  Except as otherwise stated, all values shall be determined consistently with SEC regulations. 
   (2)   VCI Performance Factor   shall be linearly interpolated between indicated values for Cumulative Value Creation Index results between values indicated in table.

 RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

Exhibit 

CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  COMPUTATION OF RATIOS OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 
  (Amounts in millions, except ratios) 
    
  The following table sets forth our historical ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the periods indicated. You should read these ratios of earnings to fixed charges in connection with our consolidated and combined financial statements, including the notes to those statements.  

(a) 
    Note: Had we been a stand-alone company for the full year 2014, and had the same level of debt throughout the year as we did on December 31, 2014, of approximately $6.4 billion, we would have incurred $314 million of pre-tax interest expense, on a pro-forma basis, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the $72 million pre-tax interest expense reported on our statement of operations for the year then ended.  Therefore, the insufficient coverage on a pro-forma basis would have been approximately $2,437 million. 
      (b) 
    The nine months ended September 30, 2016 amount includes non-cash, unusual and infrequent items consisting of $793 million of net gain on the early extinguishment of debt, $243 million of non-cash derivative losses on outstanding hedges, a $31 million gain from asset divestitures, a $12 million interest charge for the write-off of deferred debt costs and $33 million of other non-recurring charges.  Excluding these items, our loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 would have been approximately $258 million.  Therefore, the insufficient coverage would have been approximately $261 million.   The nine months ended September 30, 2015 amount includes non-cash, unusual and infrequent items consisting of $72 million of severance and early retirement costs, $33 million of non-cash derivative gains and $6 million of other non-recurring charges.  Excluding these items, our loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 would have been approximately $392 million.  Therefore, the insufficient coverage would have been approximately $400 million. 
      (c) 
    The year ended December 31, 2015 amount includes non-cash, unusual and infrequent items consisting of $4.9 billion of asset impairments, $71 million of write-down of certain assets, $67 million of early retirement and severance costs, $11 million of rig termination and other costs and $8 million of debt transactions costs, partially offset by $52 million of non-cash derivative gains.  Excluding these items, our loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have been approximately $519 million.  Therefore, the insufficient coverage would have been approximately $528 million.  The December 31, 2014 amount includes non-cash, unusual and infrequent items consisting of $3.4 billion of asset impairments, $52 million of rig termination and other price-related costs, and $55 million of Spin-off and transition related costs.  Excluding these items, our income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have been approximately $1.1 billion, and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 15.  
      (d) 
    The 2014 ratio takes into consideration interest on the debt associated with the Spin-off which we entered into during the last half of 2014.
