Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information; Risk Factors 
    
  This report for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   ("Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Canadian and United States securities laws, including the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. From time to time, our public filings, press releases and other communications (such as conference calls and presentations) will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking information is often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "forecast," "target," "project," "may," "will," "should," "could," "estimate," "predict," or similar words suggesting future outcomes or language suggesting an outlook. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to expectations of our prospects, future revenue, earnings, activities and technical results. 
    
  Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management concerning anticipated financial performance, business prospects, strategies and regulatory developments.  Although management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made as of the date they were issued and we do not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. 
    
  By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and risks that outcomes implied by forward-looking statements will not be achieved. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. 
    
  These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the impact of: levels and volatility of oil and gas prices; cyclical nature of the energy industry and credit risks of our customers; fluctuations of our revenue and earnings; operating hazards inherent in our operations; changes in governmental regulations, including those related to the climate and hydraulic fracturing; consolidation or loss of our customers; the highly competitive nature of our business; technological advancements and trends in our industry, and improvements in our competitors  products; global economic and political environment, and financial markets; terrorist attacks, natural disasters and pandemic diseases; our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability, currency restrictions and trade and economic sanctions; cybersecurity incidents; protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights; changes in, or our failure to comply with, environmental regulations; restrictions under our credit facility that that may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs and could accelerate our debt payments; failure of our manufactured products and claims under our product warranties; availability of raw materials, component parts and finished products to produce our products, and our ability deliver the products we manufacture in a timely manner; retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and key employees; and ability to identify and complete acquisitions. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events.

Note 1   Nature of Operations and Basis of Preparation 
    
  Nature of Operations 
    
  Tesco Corporation a global leader in the design, assembly, and service delivery of technology-based solutions for the upstream energy industry. The Company seeks to change the way wells are drilled by delivering safer and more efficient solutions that add value by reducing the costs of drilling for, and producing, oil and natural gas. Product and service offerings consist mainly of equipment sales and services to major oil and natural gas service companies and exploration and production operating companies throughout the world.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  There have been no material changes to our accounting policies as described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)  . The standard improves the accounting for income tax consequences of intra-entry transfers of assets other than inventory. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, but the impact is not expected to be material. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The standard addresses the classification and presentation of eight specific cash flow issues that currently result in diverse practices. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a retrospective approach. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, but the impact is not expected to be material. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation     (Topic 718),   which requires income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It will also allow an employer to repurchase more of an employees' shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The update will be effective January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations, or disclosures in notes to consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which is a comprehensive new lease standard that amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. It will require recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The update will be effective January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Note disclosures. 

5 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update will be effective January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2017. We have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this standard. However, we will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018.  

Note 3   Inventories, net 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we commenced certain supply chain initiatives designed to optimize the utilization of our global inventory. From these initiatives, certain component parts inventory held by our foreign locations that previously were only considered generally available for sale directly to our customers are now a potential source for any current or future manufacturing or assembly activity.  Historically, this inventory was classified as finished goods as our intent with this inventory was to sell it directly to customers in its current state.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we classify such inventory as raw material and component parts to properly reflect the nature and expected future utilization of the inventory as a result of the supply chain initiatives. At   December 31, 2015  , the value of the component parts inventory that was included in finished goods, now considered raw materials and component parts was   $24.9 million  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , inventories, net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of   $9.1 million   and   $11.8 million  , respectively, by major classification were as follows (in thousands).  

We evaluated our global inventory and projected sales estimates and inventory usage in light of the current operating environment and the timing of the forecasted recovery. Based on our analysis, we determined that certain inventory items had net realizable values that were less than their carrying amounts. Accordingly, we recorded an aggregate inventory charge of   $3.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Of this charge,   $1.7 million   and   $1.4 million   related to finished goods and raw materials, respectively.    

Note 4   Prepaid and other current assets 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , prepaid and other current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):

Note 5   Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , property, plant and equipment by major classification were as follows (in thousands): 

Depreciation and amortization expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are included on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income as follows (in thousands):  

Sale of Operating Assets 
    
  When pipe handling products that we manufacture are used in our rental fleet and sold, the sales proceeds are included in revenue and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services within product sales of our Products segment. When CDS products that we manufacture are used in our rental fleet and sold, the sales proceeds are included in revenue and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services within CDS, parts and accessories of our Tubular Services segment. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   six   and   one   used top drives were sold from our rental fleet, which had an aggregate net book value   $1.4 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively.   No   used top drives were sold during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Asset Impairment 
    
  We evaluate for potential impairment of long-lived tangible and intangible assets subject to amortization when indicators of impairment are present. Circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment include significant adverse changes in industry trends, economic climate, legal factors, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. More specifically, significant adverse changes in industry trends include substantial declines in revenue rates, utilization rates, oil and natural gas market prices and industry rig counts. In performing an impairment evaluation, we estimate the future undiscounted net cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of long-lived tangible and intangible assets grouped at the lowest level that cash flows can be identified, which is our operating segments. If the sum of the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, then we determine the fair value of the asset group. The amount of an impairment charge is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group. 
    
  Since late 2014, oil prices have declined significantly resulting in an industry downturn, affecting both drilling and production services. Consequently, we saw an overall decline in the number of new wells drilled and the average rig count throughout 2015, which impacted the demand for our products and services. We continued to see further declines during the first three months of 2016, which resulted in significantly lower cash flow projections. Accordingly, we performed an impairment evaluation on our long-lived assets as per the guidance of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. Consequently, during the three months ended   March 31, 2016  , we recognized   $0.9 million   of impairment related to intangibles and   $34.6 million   to reduce the carrying

     Table of Contents  

values of our fixed assets to estimated fair value in our Products operating segment. The value of assets in our Tubular Services operating segment are deemed to be recoverable, and no impairment resulted.  
    
  We measured the fair value of the asset group by applying a combination of the market approach and the cost approach at February 29, 2016. To estimate the fair value in-exchange of the property, plant and equipment, we utilized the market approach and relied upon a combination of third party market comparable, recent market sales, review of salvage values from published guides and management estimates. To estimate the fair value in-exchange for the two large manufacturing plants located in Houston and Calgary, we relied upon the improved sales comparison approach / discussions with brokers to estimate the market value. For the remaining 3 minor owned locations, the indirect cost approach was utilized. Our estimates of fair value required us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement, including assumptions related to the future performance of our Products operating segment, such as future oil prices, amount of drilling activity, and projected demand for our services.  
    
  The following tables present the impairments recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, by our major categories of property, plant and equipment and by our major categories of intangible assets (in thousands): 

Note 6   Warranties 
    
  Changes in our warranty reserves during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands):

Note 7   Earnings per Share and Shareholders' Equity 
    
  Weighted Average Shares 
    
  The following table reconciles basic and diluted weighted average shares (in thousands): 

Shares were excluded from the calculation of the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding as the Company was in a net loss position for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The inclusion of the shares would be anti-dilutive. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   426,000   and   408,000   shares excluded, respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , there were approximately   218,000   and   239,000   shares excluded, respectively. 
    
  Common Stock Issued 
    
  In June 2016, the Company completed a secondary public equity offering of   7.0   million common shares that generated proceeds of   $46.7 million  , net of underwriting discounts, commissions, issuance costs and expenses. In July 2016, our underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional   130,752   common shares that generated nearly   $1 million   in additional proceeds. The unexercised options expired on July 8, 2016. 

Note 8   Income Taxes 
    
  TESCO is an Alberta, Canada corporation. We conduct business and are taxed on profits earned in certain jurisdictions around the world. Income taxes have been provided for based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted or in which we are considered a resident for income tax purposes. 
    
  Our income tax provision (benefit) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows (in thousands): 

Our effective tax rate, which is income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax earnings, was a   2%     benefit   and   0%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to a   (11)%   and   (32)%     expense   for the same periods in   2015  . The current income tax benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to refunds in certain tax jurisdictions. 
    
  We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the related jurisdiction in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider the available positive and negative evidence, including the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and forecast of future taxable income which inherently requires significant assumptions and judgment.

Note 9   Long-Term Debt and Credit Facility 
    
  We entered into our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on   April 27, 2012   (the "Credit Facility"), to provide a revolving line of credit of   $125 million  , including up to   $20 million   of swing line loans (collectively, the "Revolver"). In February 2016, we reduced the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility by   $65 million   to   $60 million  . See Part II, Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  On August 9, 2016, we terminated the Credit Facility in order to eliminate certain fees and expenses associated with maintaining an undrawn credit facility and wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of debt issuance cost of   $0.1 million   related to the facility. Letters of credit that had been outstanding within the Revolver prior to its termination have now been collateralized by cash on deposit. At   September 30, 2016  , we maintain   $2.0 million   on deposit as collateral for outstanding letters of credit. This deposit is classified as restricted cash within prepaid and other assets on the balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal contingencies 
    
  In the normal course of our business, we are subject to legal proceedings brought by or against us and our subsidiaries. None of the proceedings involves a claim for damages exceeding   ten percent   of our current assets on a consolidated basis. There can be no assurance as to the eventual outcome or the amount of loss we may suffer as a result of these proceedings. 
    
  Other Contingencies 
    
  We are contingently liable under letters of credit and similar instruments that we enter into in connection with the importation of equipment into foreign countries and to secure our performance on certain contracts. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our total exposure under outstanding letters of credit was   $2.7 million  , which was secured by restricted cash on deposit, and   $5.4 million  , respectively. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , accounts receivable included approximately   $1.6 million   from a customer in Mexico for the period of May 2013 through July 2014 that are unbilled due to a contractual rate dispute.

Geographic Areas 
    
  We attribute revenue to geographic regions based on the location of the customer. Generally, for service activities, this will be the region in which the service activity occurs. For equipment sales, this will be the geographical region in which the product is initially deployed. Our revenue by geographic area for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows (in thousands):

Major customers and credit risk  
    
  Accounts receivable are subject to normal industry credit risks and are principally derived from major oil and natural gas service companies and exploration and production companies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and grant credit based upon past payment history, financial condition and anticipated industry conditions. Customer payments are regularly monitored and a provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon specific situations and overall industry conditions. Many of our customers are located in regions that are inherently subject to risks of economic, political and civil instabilities, which may impact our ability to collect. The main factors in determining the allowance needed for accounts receivable are customer bankruptcies, delinquency and management s estimate of ability to collect outstanding receivables based on the number of days outstanding and risks of economic, political and civil instabilities. Bad debt expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.  

Note 12 Subsequent Events 
    
  On November 3, 2016, the authorities in Egypt devalued the Egyptian pound by   32.3%   and announced the currency would be allowed to float. The move devalued the rate from the previous official rate of 8.8 to 13.0 to the U.S. dollar, and the floating exchange rate has declined further. At September 30, 2016, we maintained cash of   $1.9 million   on deposit in an Egyptian bank. Due to currency controls, intended to maintain the value of the Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar, our ability to convert Egyptian pounds to other currencies and transfer the funds freely outside of the country was limited. We are currently evaluating the full impact of this action on our financial statements.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements.  Please see "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information; Risk Factors" above and "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A below and in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. 

Overview and Outlook 
    
  We are a global technology leader and provider of highly engineered solutions for drilling, servicing, and completion of wells with facilities in North America, Europe, Russia, Latin America, Middle East, and Asia Pacific. Operations consist of pipe handling product sales and rentals, after-market sales and services, and tubular services, including related products and accessories sales.  
    
  Unless indicated otherwise, results of operations data are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 
    
  Business Environment 
    
  Our revenue is heavily dependent on the level of drilling activity of exploration and production companies, which is performed primarily through drilling contractors. The willingness of exploration and production companies to spend capital on drilling activities is primarily affected by the current and anticipated prices of crude oil and natural gas, which is driven by such factors as the level of worldwide oil and gas reserves inventory, civil unrest and conflicts in oil producing countries, oil sanctions, and global economics, among other things. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oilfield services companies like ours. Accordingly, rig count and well count are important business barometers for the drilling industry and its suppliers, as they may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity. However, it is important to look at rig count in conjunction with the well count. Moreover, these counts should not be solely relied on as an indicator of the economic condition of our industry, as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.

Below is a table that shows the average rig count by region for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Outlook 
    
  The effect and duration of the oil and gas industry downturn continues to be unpredictable. We began to see a decline in crude oil prices after the average West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") and Brent crude reached highs of $107.95 and $115.19, respectively, in June 2014. The declines continued throughout the remainder of 2014 and 2015, with WTI and Brent crude at $36.36 and $36.61, respectively, at the end of 2015. The spot prices of WTI and Brent crude at   September 30, 2016   have shown moderate increases to $47.72 and $48.24, respectively. The current outlook for commodity prices remains highly uncertain, but we believe evidence suggests they will remain relatively unchanged for the remainder of 2016 with only modest increase for 2017.   (2)   
    
  The Company's response to the market conditions has resulted in aggressive cost rationalization and global reorganization to right-size the company. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the global workforce was reduced by an additional 25%, as compared to December 31, 2015, resulting in a charge of   $3.3 million  . Facility closures during the same period resulted in a charge of   $0.9 million  . In addition, certain austerity measures and efforts to streamline our overhead and support structure initiated in the previous year continued. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the global workforce was reduced by 30%, resulting in a related aggregate charge of $10.9 million. We expect to complete almost all of our planned cost reduction and restructuring actions by year-end, but that alone will not return us to profitability. We also need to grow our revenue run rates and improve our products and services mix in order to improve profitability. 
    
  Recent higher crude oil prices and increased rig count in North America are some evidence that suggests the market bottom is forming. Despite this gradual increase, we still believe that the path to recovery will be slow and volatile as international and offshore markets will remain weak and global oilfield services pricing remains challenged and unsustainable. However, our nearly completed cost reductions and restructuring actions as well as strong liquidity position should allow us to weather the slow recovery and participate early in the recovery. Accordingly, cash generation and preservation continue to be a high priority. At the same time, we will continue to invest in initiatives that should quicken our return to profitability.  
    
  While pricing in North America remains at unsustainable levels, it is slowly driving competitor attrition. This highlights the importance of cost efficiency, differentiation, automation of services and liquidity in this market as key measures of survivability and the ability to secure market share as activity increases.

The Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is a weekly census of the number of drilling rigs actively exploring for or developing oil or natural gas in the United States and Canada. The Baker Hughes International Rotary Rig Count is a monthly census of active drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or natural gas outside North America (U.S. and Canada). To be counted as active, a rig must be on location and be drilling or 'turning to the right'. A rig is considered active from the moment the well is "spudded" until it reaches target depth. Rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up or being used in non-drilling activities such as workovers, completions or production testing, are not counted as active.

Within our Products segment we will continue funding the development and commercialization of our suite of rig floor mechanization technologies. We completed lab testing of the Pipe Drive System ("PDS'') and expect to commercialize this project next year. In addition, land catwalk adoption is growing with increased demand coming mostly from the Middle East. As initial demand is coming from rentals, we will add a few catwalks to our rental fleet over the next few quarters with the expectation they will convert to product sales in the future. Over time we expect most rigs will operate with a catwalk to deliver pipe to the rig floor in a safe and automated manner. Therefore, we expect most of the demand in the future to convert to product sales. 
    
  In addition, we continue to expand the scope of our after-market service capabilities. That new scope includes repairing and upgrading third-party pipe-handling equipment and expanding our footprint cost-effectively by adding distributors to markets we choose not to operate in directly. Not only may these distributors be an outlet for local after-market service, they may also generate opportunities for additional new and used product sales and tubular services. In the third quarter of 2016 we added our second distributor after changing our means of distribution in a market. 
    
  We continue to increase the installations of our first generation Automated Rig Controls ("ARC") product, which adds significant drilling performance to top drives. While customer feedback has been very positive thus far, we continue to develop further performance and drilling features that will be part of one seamless, fully-integrated performance-enhancing platform. 
    
  Within our Tubular Services segment, we will continue to convert more land market share from conventional casing running to our automated Evolution model, which requires significantly less manpower and equipment. We expect conversion rates to increase as we introduce additional cementing accessories, like our new multi-plug launch system ("MPLS"), which is currently performing field tests and is expected to be commercialize in the coming quarters. The combination of this plug launch system and our side-entry cement swivel with the CDS   TM    will provide significant value creation for our customers while giving us additional cost efficiencies, which we expect to disrupt the industry cost model, allow us to gain market share and improve our profitability.

Operating results by business segments 
    
  Below is a summary of the operating results of our business segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Products Segment 
    
  Revenues from our Products segment are generated through pipe handling product sales, rentals, and after-market sales and service. Sales of Products consist of new and used pipe handling products. Our rental fleet of pipe handling products is highly mobile, where we install the units on the customers' rig site and charge a daily rate for rental operating days. Rental operating days are defined as a day that a unit in our rental fleet is under contract and operating. 
    
  Our after-market sales and service consists of providing parts and servicing units. We provide these services for automated pipe handling equipment we manufacture and selected models of our competitors. 
    
  Q3 2016   as compared with   Q3 2015 
    
  Sales 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $1.1 million  , or   20%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to fewer top drive units sold globally as a result of decreased demand, rig count and crude oil prices. In the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   3   new top drives, as compared to the same period in   2015  , where we sold   5   new top drives.  
    
  Rental Services 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $6.9 million  , or   49%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to the depressed market demand within the industry, which led to a 16% decrease in our utilization. At   September 30, 2016   utilization declined to 21% due to fewer operating days and fewer contracted units. The decrease in activity in conjunction with price compression primarily impacted our revenues in Latin America.

     Table of Contents  

After-  Market Sales and Services 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $3.9 million  , or   42%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a decline in demand for parts and services in North America and Asia Pacific, accounting for 60% and 28%, respectively, of the total decline. With the continued decline in oil prices and consequential decrease in drilling activity, customers have chosen to defer non-critical services and consume their inventories rather than replenish them. 
    
  Operating Loss 
  Products operating loss     increased   by   $3.5 million  , or   90%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to an inventory charge of $3.0 million. Declines in revenue were offset by reductions in operating expenses derived from our aggressive restructuring and cost rationalization efforts. Reductions in workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of   $0.1 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  YTD 2016   as compared with   YTD 2015    
    
  Sales 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $20.0 million  , or   54%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to fewer top drive units sold globally as a result of decreased demand driven by reduced rig count and depressed crude oil prices. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold a total of   15   top drives, of which   9   were new and   6   were from our rental fleet, as compared to the same period in   2015  , when we sold   30   top drives, of which   29   were new and   one   was from our rental fleet. We recognized revenue of $2.8 million and $0.8 million related to the sale of the used top drives from our rental fleet during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Rental Services 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $32.2 million  , or   62%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to the depressed market demand within the industry causing a 44% decrease in utilization rates. At   September 30, 2016  , utilization declined to 16% due to fewer operating days and fewer contracted units. The decrease in activity compounded with price compression primarily impacted our revenues in Latin America. 
    
  After-  Market Sales and Services 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $13.9 million  , or   44%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a decline in demand for parts and services in North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East, accounting for 52%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of the total decline. With the continued decline in oil prices and consequential decrease in drilling activity, customers have chosen to defer non-critical services and consume their inventories rather than replenish them. 
    
  Operating Loss 
  Products operating loss     increased   by   $47.2 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to the impairment charge discussed below and the decline in revenues for each product offering due to current market conditions as a result of continued declines in oil prices and in overall demand for oilfield services.  
    
  During the three months ended   March 31, 2016  , we identified indicators that could cause potential impairments to our long-lived assets. Due to these indicators, we conducted testing for impairment and determined that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in our Products segment exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized an aggregate long-lived asset impairment of $33.6 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For further discussion, see Part 1, Item 1, "Financial Statements,   Note 5  ", included in this report. Reductions in workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of   $1.5 million   and   $4.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Tubular Services Segment 
    
  We generate revenues in our Tubular Services segment from land and offshore services augmented by sales of products, accessories and consumables for the casing running process. Our services include personnel and equipment, including the CDS   TM   , power tongs, pick up/lay-down units, torque monitoring services, and connection testing services for new well completion and in work-over or re-entry operations. Our product sales include the CDS   TM   , down-well consumables, and other non-consumable parts.  
    
  Q3 2016   as compared with   Q3 2015 
    
  Land 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $13.2 million  , or   63%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to decreased activity and demand in Latin America and North America of 51% and 47%, respectively. The decrease in rig count and overall activity resulted in a reduction of jobs performed during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared

     Table of Contents  

to   2015  . In addition, we experienced significant price compression within tubular services during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015  .  
    
  Offshore 
  Revenue  s     decreased     by     $3.4 million  , or   45%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a decrease in the number of operating rigs within the Asia Pacific region during the   third   quarter of   2016  . This decrease is partially offset by offshore revenue in North America as the mix of services we performed continued to shift towards higher revenue generating deep-water services.  
    
  CDS, Parts,   Accesso  ries 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $2.6 million  , or   62%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to lower CDS   TM    equipment sales and customers postponing capital expenditures in light of the decline in oil prices and overall reduction in operating rigs. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had $0.4 million of sales for CDS  equipment sales, compared to $3.3 million of sales during the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Operating Loss 
  Tubular Services operating loss   increased   by   $4.4 million  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to the aforementioned declines in revenue partially offset by cost reductions achieved through aggressive cost rationalization efforts undertaken. Reductions in workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  YTD 2016   as compared with   YTD 2015    
    
  Land 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $48.7 million  , or   65%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to decreased activity and demand in North America and Latin America of 45% and 43%, respectively. The decrease in rig count and overall activity resulted in a reduction of jobs being performed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015  . Additionally, the continued decline in oil prices and tubular services competition compressed pricing.  
    
  Offshore 
  Revenue  s     decreased     by     $10.2 million  , or   39%  , for the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a decrease in the number of operating rigs within the Asia Pacific region. This decrease was partially offset by offshore revenue in North America as our mix of services performed continued to shift towards higher revenue generating deep-water services.  
    
  CDS, Parts,   Accesso  ries 
  Revenues   decreased   by   $3.2 million  , or   50%  , for the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to lower CDS   TM    equipment sales and declining part sales driven by customers postponing capital expenditures in light of the decline in market conditions. Revenue for CDS  equipment sales was $1.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $3.3 million of sales during the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Operating Loss 
  Tubular Services operating loss   increased   by   $19.0 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to the aforementioned declines in revenue partially offset by cost reductions achieved through aggressive cost rationalization efforts undertaken. Reductions in workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of   $2.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Declines were further offset by an adjustment in the amount of past due disputed accounts payable during the three months ended March 31, 2016. 
    
  Research and Engineering Segment 
    
  We are a technology-based company deploying new technologies to increase rig automation, rig mechanization, and to enhance our field operations. We are working aggressively to drive a more definitive integration between the drilling rig and tubular services technology. We continue to invest in our research and engineering in order to continually develop, commercialize, and enhance our proprietary products relating to our current product offerings and new technologies in development.

  Operating expenses   decreased   by   $0.8 million  , or   40%  , during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a decrease in spending related to targeted cost rationalization efforts.    
    
  YTD 2016   as compared with   YTD 2015    
    
  Operating expenses   decreased   by   $2.7 million  , or   39%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a decrease in spending related to targeted cost rationalization efforts.    
    
  Corporate and Other Segment 
    
  Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of overhead, general and administrative expenses, and certain selling and marketing expenses.     Corporate and other expenses as a percent of revenues were   17%   and   10%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Q3 2016   as compared with   Q3 2015 
    
  Operating expenses   decreased   by   $1.0 million  , or   16%  , during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to cost saving measures implemented in 2015 and continuing in 2016. The benefits of these cost saving measures are visible primarily in personnel costs and various discretionary spending accounts. 
    
  YTD 2016   as compared with   YTD 2015    
    
  Operating expenses   decreased   by   $2.6 million  , or   12%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to cost saving measures implemented in 2015 and continuing in 2016.

  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was flat during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   and included the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.3 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the cancellation of our Credit Facility in August 2016.  
    
  Interest Income 
  Interest income   increased   by   $0.4 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to interest received on short term investment of excess cash held in Latin America.  
    
  Foreign Exchange Loss 
  Although our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, our operations have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. Foreign exchange losses   decreased   by   $5.0 million  , or   76%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to exchange rates and reductions in net monetary assets subject to revaluation in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. 
    
  Income Tax Provision 
  Income tax provision   decreased   by   $13.8 million  , or   102%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $21.7 million valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rates were   0%   and a   (32)%     expense   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available cash and cash equivalents. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents increased by   $38.6 million   to   $90.1 million  , primarily due to the June 2016 secondary public equity offerings of   7.1 million   common shares of the Company (including 130,752 shares issued pursuant to the underwriter's exercise of its option to purchase additional common shares of the company in July 2016) that generated aggregate proceeds of   $47.6 million  , net of underwriting discounts, commissions, issuance costs and expenses. The offering proceeds provide us optionality to address working capital and capital spending needs in a potential market recovery while also funding strategic initiatives to gain market share through technology offerings and possibly through acquisitions. We believe our current cash balance is more than adequate to conduct our business.  
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  In addition to the lease commitments as described in Part II, Item 7 "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of   September 30, 2016  , our off-balance sheet arrangements included manufacturing purchase commitments and letters of credit as noted below.  
    
  Manufacturing Purchase Commitments 
  Our manufacturing purchase commitments, which represent executed purchase orders that have been submitted to our respective vendors, have   decreased   from   $8.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015   to   $6.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  This   decrease   of   $2.1 million  , or   25%  , is driven primarily by the receipt of orders and the cancellation of prior orders with vendors due to the decline in product demand caused by the decline in oil prices. 
    
  Letters of Credit 
  The Company enters into letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total outstanding letters of credit was   $2.7 million  , which were collateralized by cash on deposit. See Part 1, Item 1,  Financial Statements,   Note 9   and   Note 10  ", included in this Report.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
    
  Accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 7 "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10 K. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Results of operations and financial condition, as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions, changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of the business and customers. While these issues require judgments that may be subjective, they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data. The most critical accounting policies are those described in  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10 K.  During the   three and nine   ended   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to the types of judgments, assumptions, and estimates upon which our critical accounting estimates are based.  

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  See Part I, Item 7A  "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10 K for a detailed discussion of the risks affecting the Company. There have been no material changes to the market risks described in Part I, Item 7A  "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" disclosed in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10 K. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures designed and maintained to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed with the  SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified by the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer participated with management in evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
