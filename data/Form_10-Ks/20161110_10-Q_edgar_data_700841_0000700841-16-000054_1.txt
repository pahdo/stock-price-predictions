Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements of RCM Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries ("RCM" or the "Company") are unaudited. The year-end consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission pertaining to reports on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended January 2, 2016 included in the Company's Annual Report Form 10-K for such period. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.

The consolidated financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for such interim periods.

Results for the thirteen and thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year.

2.

Fiscal Year

The Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.  The fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 was a 52-week reporting year.  The third fiscal quarters of 2016 and 2015 ended on the following dates, respectively:

Use of Estimates and Uncertainties

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Company uses estimates to calculate an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivables, adequacy of reserves, the tax rate applied and the valuation of certain assets and liability accounts.  These estimates can be significant to the operating results and financial position of the Company.

The Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance.  The amounts included in the Company's costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company's claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company's carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and borrowings under line of credit, approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature.  The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to foreign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.

 Accounts Receivable, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable

The Company's accounts receivable are comprised as follows:

Unbilled receivables primarily represent revenues earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the balance sheet ending date.  Work-in-process primarily represents revenues earned under contracts which the Company contractually invoices at future dates.

From time to time, the Company's Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things, construction management and engineering services.  Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage subcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project value; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory.  Under the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the corresponding payment from the Company's end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of the subcontractor or staffing agency the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a "transit account receivable" and "transit account payable" as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and generally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit account payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company's transit accounts payable generally exceeds the Company's transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and spreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit accounts receivable was $3.5 million and related transit accounts payable was $5.9 million, for a net liability of $2.4 million, as of October 1, 2016.  The transit accounts receivable was $7.5 million and related transit accounts payable was $9.0 million, for a net liability of $1.5 million, as of January 2, 2016.

5. 
 
 Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their estimated useful lives.  The annual rates are 20% for computer hardware and software as well as furniture and office equipment.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.

Property and equipment are comprised of the following:

 Property and Equipment (Continued)

The Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets.  The Company wrote off fully depreciated and amortized assets of $2,677 and $3,470 during the thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively.  Depreciation expense for the thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 was $1,114 and $1,026, respectively.

6. 
 
 Acquisitions

The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration.

Future Contingent Payments 

As of October 1, 2016, the Company had three active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the former shareholders: 1) effective July 1, 2012 the Company acquired certain assets of BGA, LLC ("BGA"); 2) effective August 1, 2014 the Company acquired all of the stock of Point Comm, Inc. ("PCI"); and 3) effective July 5, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets of Substation Design Services, LLC ("SDS"). The Company estimates future contingent payments at October 1, 2016 as follows:

Estimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates.   Future contingent payments to be made to BGA, PCI and SDS are capped at cumulative maximums of $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  The Company estimates future contingent consideration in payments based on forecasted performance and recorded at the net present value of those expected payments as of  October 1, 2016 .  The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" (ASU Topic 820-10-35) refers to as Level 3 inputs. 

The Company paid $0.8 and $0.1 million in contingent consideration during the thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively.

SDS 

Effective July 5, 2015, the Company acquired the business operations of SDS, a Pennsylvania based engineering company specializing in the in design services for substation projects.  SDS has experience with substation design, including electrical design, system protection and control design, and civil structural design. The Company expects the purchase of SDS to complement and expand RCM's engineering services offerings and provide RCM's customers with a stronger depth of experienced engineering resources. The Company believes that the SDS assembled workforce consists of highly trained and experienced engineers that will greatly assist RCM in executing future growth in revenues.  The SDS acquisition operates as part of the Company's Engineering segment.

Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations.  The Company is required to assess the carrying value of its reporting units that contain goodwill at least on an annual basis.  The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step impairment test.  If the Company believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required.  The Company formally assesses these qualitative factors, and if necessary, conducts its annual goodwill impairment test as of the last day of the Company's fiscal November each year or if indicators of impairment exist.  During all periods presented, the Company determined that the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists.  Since there have been no indicators of impairment, the Company has not performed a quantitative impairment test.

There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016.

8. 
 
 Intangible Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  When the Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value.  Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  The Company's intangible assets consist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.  During all periods presented, the Company determined that no impairment of intangible assets exists.

The following table reflects the activity for net intangible assets, excluding goodwill which is substantially attributable to the Company's Engineering segment for the periods presented:

 Line of Credit

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to a loan agreement with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, amended and restated effective February 20, 2009, which provides for a $35 million revolving credit facility and includes a sub-limit of $5 million for letters of credit (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and expires December 11, 2019.  The Revolving Credit Facility has been amended several times, most recently pursuant to the Sixth Amendment entered into on June 13, 2016 when another daily borrowing rate option was added, and the Fifth Amendment entered into on December 14, 2015 when certain definitions, including without limitation those of terms that are elements of the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, including Applicable LIBOR Rate Margin, Applicable Prime Rate Margin, Fixed Charge Ratio, Letter of Credit Applicable Margin and Permitted Dividend.  The Amendment also deletes the definition of Modified Current Ratio.  The Fifth Amendment also revised certain provisions relating to unused line fees, permitted dividends, a permitted disposition, fees for unused availability under the revolving credit line and certain elements of the financial and operating covenants.  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing.  These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank's prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations.  The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn.  Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense.  The effective interest rate, including unused line fees, for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 was 2.3%.

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries.  The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts on the Company's ability to borrow in order to pay dividends.  The Company paid special cash dividends on December 30, 2014 and December 30, 2015 which were expressly permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the line of credit as of October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 were $11.2 million and $21.0 million, respectively.  At October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 there were letters of credit outstanding for $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  At October 1, 2016, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $23.1 million.

Both basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods are calculated based on the reported earnings in the Company's consolidated statements of income.

The number of shares of common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 was determined as follows:

 Per Share Data (Continued)

There were 42,500 and 40,000 absolute anti-dilutive shares not included in the calculation of common stock equivalents for the thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively.  These were determined to be anti-dilutive because the exercise prices of these shares for the periods were higher than the average market price of the Company's common stock for the same periods.

Unissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:

11. 
 
 Share-Based Compensation

At October 1, 2016, the Company had four share-based employee compensation plans.  The Company measures the fair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes method and using the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Awards vest over periods ranging from one to three years and expire within 10 years of issuance.  Share-based compensation expense related to time-based awards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method.  The Company vests performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and the associated awards are therefore likely to vest.  Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are also expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed, depending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later determined to be unlikely to vest.

Share-based compensation expense of $614 and $907 was recognized for the  thirty-nine week periods  ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively.  Share based compensation for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 did not include any expense associated with performance-based restricted stock units since they were, as of October 1, 2016, determined to be unlikely to vest.

As of October 1, 2016, the Company had approximately $0.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all time-based non-vested share-based awards granted under the Company's various share-based plans, which the Company expects to recognize over approximately a two-year period.  These amounts do not include a) performance-based restricted stock units, b) the cost of any additional share-based awards that may be granted in future periods or c) the impact of any potential changes in the Company's forfeiture rate.

 Share-Based Compensation (Continued)

Incentive Share-Based Plans 

2000 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan)

The 2000 Plan, approved by the Company's stockholders in April 2001, provided for the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock to officers and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company.  As of October 1, 2016, options to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock granted under the 2000 Plan were outstanding.  The 2000 Plan has expired therefore no shares are available for grant thereunder.

2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan)

The 2007 Plan, approved by the Company's stockholders in June 2007, provides for the issuance of up to 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the Company and its subsidiaries or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company.  As of October 1, 2016, under the 2007 Plan, no shares of common stock were available for future grants and options to purchase 19,500 shares of common stock, as well as 25,834 restricted stock units, were outstanding.  The 2007 Plan has expired therefore no shares are available for grant thereunder.

2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)

The 2014 Plan, approved by the Company's stockholders in December 2014, provides for the issuance of up to 625,000 shares of the Company's common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the Company and its subsidiaries or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.  As of October 1, 2016, under the 2014 Plan, 408,000 restricted stock units were outstanding and 157,000 shares were available for awards thereunder.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") with shareholder approval, effective January 1, 2001.  Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment qualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through payroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the offering period.  The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation.

In fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Plan to December 31, 2025.

The Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company's first two fiscal quarters and the last two fiscal quarters.  Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent offering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions.  The number of shares issued at the beginning of the current period (on July 5, 2016) was 41,180.  As of October 1, 2016, there were 268,211 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Stock Options 

There were no options granted during both  thirty-nine week periods  ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015.   Activity regarding outstanding options for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 is as follows: 

As of October 1, 2016, the Company had approximately $7 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all non-vested stock option awards.

Time-Based Restricted Stock Units 

From time-to-time the Company issues time-based restricted stock units.  These time-based restricted stock units typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee's restricted stock unit fully vests.  Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  Dividends for time-based restricted stock units that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.

To date, the Company has only issued time-based restricted stock units under the 2007 and 2014 Plans.  The following summarizes the activity in the time-based restricted stock units under the 2007 and 2014 Plans during 2016:

 Share-Based Compensation (Continued)

Time-Based Restricted Stock Units (Continued) 

Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock of $6.63 per share on September 30, 2016 (the last trading day prior to October 1, 2016), the intrinsic value of the time-based non-vested restricted stock units at October 1, 2016 was approximately $1.6 million.  As of October 1, 2016, there was approximately $0.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over the vesting period of the restricted stock units.

Performance Based Restricted Stock Units 

From time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock units to its executives.  Performance-based restricted stock units are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics as determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. These performance-based restricted stock units typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock units that actually vest, if any.  Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  Dividends for performance-based restricted stock units that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.   

To date, the Company has only issued performance-based restricted stock units under the 2014 Plan.  The following summarizes the activity in the performance-based restricted stock units during 2016:

As of October 1, 2016, the Company considers the performance-based restricted stock unit metrics unlikely to be achieved, thus no performance condition is probable of achievement and no compensation cost has been recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units. The Company will reassess at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing compensation cost if and when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable.  The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period.

 Treasury Stock Transactions

On October 28, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program to purchase up to $5.0 million of outstanding shares of common stock at the prevailing market prices, from time to time over the subsequent 12-month period.  On September 30, 2014, the Board extended this repurchase program through October 31, 2015.  On September 11, 2015, the Board extended this repurchase program through December 31, 2016.  On August 9, 2016, the Board authorized an additional $5.0 million to the repurchase program and extended this repurchase program through December 31, 2017.  During the thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the Company purchased 357,250 shares at an average price of $5.54 per share and 103,182 shares at an average price of $4.92, respectively.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company has $5.2 million available for future treasury stock purchases.

 New Accounting Standards

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," to clarify the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations," which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations", and in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Identifying performance obligations and licensing," an update on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. Additionally, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients," which includes amendments for enhanced clarification of the guidance. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 , Leases (Topic 842),  which amended guidance for lease arrangements in order to increase transparency and comparability by providing additional information to users of financial statements regarding an entity's leasing activities. The revised guidance seeks to achieve this objective by requiring reporting entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for substantially all lease arrangements. The guidance, which is required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2019, will be applied on a modified retrospective basis beginning with the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting .  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-09 beginning with its fiscal 2017 first quarter. The Company does not expect the provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements except for the income tax consequences, which will be dependent on the volume of future option exercise activity and volatility of the Company's stock price.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (  Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period.  The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method.     The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

 Segment Information (Continued)

The Company derives a majority of its revenue from offices in the United States.  Revenues reported for each operating segment are all from external customers.  The Company is domiciled in the United States and its segments operate in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Revenues by geographic area for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 are as follows:  

Total assets by geographic area as of the reported periods are as follows:

The projected fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates as of October 1, 2016 and applied for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 are approximately 41.9% and 26.5% in the United States and Canada, respectively, and yielded a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 41.2% for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016.  For the comparable prior year period estimated income tax rates were 41.4% and 26.5% in the United States and Canada, respectively, and yielded a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 39.8% for the thirty-nine week period ended October 3, 2015.  The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company. 

From time to time, the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.  As such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of losses and possible recoveries.  The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains to some or all of these matters.  A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.  Once established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances, and could increase or decrease the Company's earnings in the period that the changes are made.  Asserted claims in these matters sought approximately $1.1 million in damages as of both  October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 .  As of October 1, 2016, the Company accrued $0.1 million for such liabilities.

The Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.

ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Overview

RCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes.  As a result, the impact of economic changes on revenues and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company's financial performance.

The Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven record of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure.  The Company is committed to optimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong vertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.

The Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business processes to compete in today's business climate.  However, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex.  The Company believes that many businesses today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives.  This has had an adverse impact on spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.

Nonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced information technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they can maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.  Although working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support increasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value.  This has given rise to a demand for outsourcing.  The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.

The Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon fixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both.  The billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services.  The Company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services.  The Company also realizes revenues from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions.  These services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company's consultants based upon their skill level, experience and the type of work performed.

The majority of the Company's services are provided under purchase orders.  Contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary.  Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more complex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days' notice.  The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables.  Typically these contracts are for less than one year.  The Company recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.

Costs of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and employees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance.  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating activities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses.  Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company's corporate marketing, administrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program.  The Company records these expenses when incurred.

ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make subjective decisions, assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgment increases, such judgments become even more subjective. While management believes its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may be materially different from estimated. Management has identified certain critical accounting policies, described below, that require significant judgment to be exercised by management.

Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues from several sources.  The Company's Engineering Services and Information Technology Services segments perform consulting and project solutions services.  All of the Company's segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue from permanent placement fees.  The majority of the Company's revenues are invoiced on a time and materials basis.

Project Services 

The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with current revenue recognition standards under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, which clarifies application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to revenue transactions.  Project services are generally provided on a cost-plus, fixed-fee or time-and-material basis.  Typically, a customer will outsource a discrete project or activity and the Company assumes responsibility for the performance of such project or activity.  The Company recognizes revenues and associated costs on a gross basis as services are provided to the customer and costs are incurred using its employees.  The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables.  The Company may recognize revenues on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.  In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-price basis and the contract will extend beyond a 12-month period, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract.  In some instances, revenue is billed at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract.  Revenues under these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred.  Amounts invoiced in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheets.  In other instances, revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour (i.e., percentage of completion). In addition, some contracts contain "Performance Fees" (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget.  Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned.  Some contracts also limit revenues and billings to specified maximum amounts.  Provision for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined.  For contracts where there is a deliverable, the work is not complete on a specific deliverable and the revenue is not recognized, the costs are deferred.  The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.

Consulting and Staffing Services 

Revenues derived from consulting and staffing services are recorded on a gross basis as services are performed and associated costs have been incurred using employees of the Company.  These services are typically billed on a time and material basis.

In certain cases, the Company may utilize other companies and their employees to fulfill customer requirements. In these cases, the Company receives an administrative fee for arranging for, billing for, and collecting the billings related to these companies.  The customer is typically responsible for assessing the work of these companies who have responsibility for acceptability of their personnel to the customer.  Under these circumstances, the Company's reported revenues are net of associated costs (effectively recognizing the net administrative fee only).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Revenue Recognition (Continued)

Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable 

From time to time, the Company's Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things, construction management and engineering services.  In certain circumstances, the Company may acquire equipment as a purchasing agent for the client for a fee.  Pursuant to these agreements, the Company: a) may engage subcontractors to provide construction or other services or contracts with manufacturers on behalf of the Company's clients to procure equipment or fixtures; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project value or a negotiated mark-up on subcontractor or procurement charges as a fee; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory.  In such situations, the Company acts as an agent under the provisions of "Overall Considerations of Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent" and therefore recognizing revenue on a "net-basis."  The Company records revenue on a "net" basis on relevant engineering and construction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those situations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.  During the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016, total gross billings, including both transit cost billings and the Company's earned fees, was $36.8 million, for which the Company recognized $21.3 million of its net fee as revenue.  During the thirty-nine week period ended October 3, 2015, total gross billings, including both transit cost billings and the Company's earned fees, was $46.9 million, for which the Company recognized $26.9 million of its net fee as revenue.

Under the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the corresponding payment from the Company's end-client is received.  Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of the subcontractor or staffing agency the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a "transit account receivable" and "transit account payable" as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and generally paid to the subcontractor within a few days.  The Company typically does not pay a given transit account payable until the related transit account receivable is collected.  The Company's transit accounts payable generally exceeds the Company's transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and spreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business.  The transit accounts receivable was $3.5 million and related transit accounts payable was $5.9 million, for a net liability of $2.4 million, as of October 1, 2016.

Permanent Placement Services 

The Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services.  Fees for placements are recognized at the time the candidate commences employment.  The Company guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days.  In the event a candidate is not retained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate.  In the event a replacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client.  An allowance for refunds, based upon the Company's historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.  Revenues are recorded on a gross basis.

Accounts Receivable

The Company's accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers.  Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers' financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required.  Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole.  The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.

ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations.  The Company is required to assess the carrying value of its reporting units that contain goodwill at least on an annual basis in order to determine if any impairment in value has occurred.  The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step impairment test. An assessment of those qualitative factors or the application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment including but not limited to the assessment of the business, its management and general market conditions, estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  The Company formally assesses these qualitative factors and, if necessary, conducts its annual goodwill impairment test as of the last day of the Company's fiscal November each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.  The Company periodically analyzes whether any such indicators of impairment exist.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a sustained, significant decline in share price and market capitalization, a decline in expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, a material change in management or other key personnel and/or slower expected growth rates, among others.  Due to the thin trading of the Company stock in the public marketplace and the impact of the control premium held by a relatively few shareholders, the Company does not consider the market capitalization of the Company the most appropriate measure of fair value of goodwill for our reporting units.  The Company looks to earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as better measures of the fair value of our reporting units.  The Company compares the fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying values, including related goodwill.  There can be no assurance that future tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges.  During all periods presented, the Company determined that the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists.  Since there have been no indicators of impairment, the Company has not performed a quantitative impairment test.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  When it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value.  Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Accounting for Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units

The Company uses stock options and restricted stock units to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service.  The Company follows "Share-Based Payment," which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements.  This compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.  The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant for restricted stock units.

ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Insurance Liabilities

The Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance.  The Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from workers compensation, considers input from third parties.  The amounts included in the Company's costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company's claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.

Accounting for Income Taxes

In establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company had a negligible domestic long term deferred tax asset and a foreign long-term deferred tax liability of $0.3 million.   The domestic long term deferred tax asset primarily represents the tax effect of accrued expenses which will be deductible for tax purposes within a twelve month period and the effect of temporary differences for the GAAP versus tax amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions made in prior periods.   Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions.  In the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, valuation allowances may be required.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17, Income taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes during the period ended April 2, 2016.  The Company chose not to apply the ASU retrospectively, and as such prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.

The Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada  and Puerto Rico.  The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and file in various states. The Company's federal income tax returns have been examined through 2010.  The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining fiscal tax years 2011 and 2012.  The State of New Jersey is currently examining fiscal tax years 2009 through 2012.  With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audits by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States for tax years prior to 2011.  The Company is no longer subject to audit in Canada prior to tax year 2010.  The Company is no longer subject to audit in Puerto Rico prior to tax year 2005. 

The Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.

There were no changes to unrecognized tax benefits during both thirteen and thirty-nine week periods presented.

Accrued Bonuses

The Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Executive management, field management and certain corporate employees' bonuses are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets.  In addition, the Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance. Variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore on the estimates of the required accruals.  Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.

ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Forward-looking Information

The Company's growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends.  The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering and information technology services.  When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company's operating performance could be adversely impacted.  The Company believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends.  However, declines in the economy could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy.

Additionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company's future earnings.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.

The consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry.  The Company competes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company's service lines.  Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing.  The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company's ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Thirteen Week Period Ended October 1, 2016 Compared to Thirteen Week Period Ended October 3, 2015

A summary of operating results for the thirteen week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 is as follows (in thousands):

The Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.  The fiscal quarters ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 consisted of thirteen weeks each.

Revenues.   Revenues decreased 11.9%, or $5.4 million, for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to the thirteen week period ended October 3, 2015 (the "comparable prior year period").  Revenues decreased $1.6 million in the Engineering segment, decreased $5.1 million in the Information Technology segment and increased $1.3 million in the Specialty Health Care segment.  On the last day of fiscal 2015 the Company disposed of its QAD Software Solutions Business Unit ("QAD Business"), which generated $0.8 million in revenues for the thirteen week period ended October 3, 2015. Excluding the QAD Business revenue, the Company's revenues for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 decreased 10.4%, or $4.6, million as compared to the comparable prior year period.  See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.

The Company has material operations in Canada, primarily from the Company's Engineering segment; this business is conducted primarily in Canadian dollars. Since the Company reports its consolidated results in U.S. dollars the consolidated results are subject to potentially material fluctuations as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate (the "Exchange Rate"). For the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016, the Company generated total revenues from its Canadian clients of $5.6 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 76.6% as compared to $6.9 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 76.2% for the prior year comparable period.

Cost of Services and Gross Profit.   Cost of services decreased 8.4%, or $2.7 million, for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period.  The decrease in cost of services was primarily due to the decrease in revenues.  Cost of services as a percentage of revenues for the thirteen week periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 was 74.4% and 71.6%, respectively.  See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.

Selling, General and Administrative.   Selling, general and administrative ("SGA") expenses decreased 10.8%, or $1.1 million, for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period.   As a percentage of revenues, SGA expenses were 23.5% for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to 23.2% for the comparable prior year period.  SGA expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenues and the Company's focus on reducing overall general and administrative costs.  See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.

Other Expense, Net.   Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company's loan agreement, net of interest income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and any other non-operating items that may occur from time to time.  There were no material changes to other expense, net for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016.

Income Tax Expense.   The Company recognized $0.2 million of income tax expense for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to $0.8 million for the comparable prior year period.  The consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 62.6% as compared to 44.5% for the comparable prior year period. The projected fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate as of October 1, 2016 was approximately 41.9% and 26.5% in the United States and Canada, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income.  The consolidated effective income tax rate increased for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period because the Company's projected fiscal 2016 Canadian income before taxes decreased as a percentage of the total projected 2016 income before taxes as compared to fiscal 2015.  Additionally, the projected fiscal 2016 effective tax rate as of October 1, 2016 of 41.2% increased from the projected rate as of July 2, 2016 of 39.2% and subsequently had an impact on the effective rate for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016.

Segment Discussion

Engineering

Engineering revenues of $17.6 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 decreased 8.5%, or $1.6 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period.  The decrease was primarily due to decreases in revenues of $1.7 million from the Company's Canadian Power Systems Engineering Group and $0.4 million from the Company's U.S. Facilities Design Group, resulting in both cases from a reduced level of project activity with certain major clients.  The Engineering segment operating income was $0.4 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to $0.8 for the comparable prior year period. The decrease of $0.4 million in operating income was due to a decrease in gross profit of $0.6 million offset by a decrease in SGA expense of $0.2 million. The Engineering segment's gross profit declined due to the decrease in revenues and a decrease in gross profit margin to 24.4% for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2016 as compared to 25.5% in the comparable prior year period. Gross profit margin decreased primarily due to poor utilization in the Company's Canadian Engineering Group and due to fixed priced work with a major U.S. utility that has not realized expected gross margin.  The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a lower allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense.

Information Technology

Information Technology revenues of $10.1 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 decreased 33.6%, or $5.1 million, as compared to $15.2 million for the comparable prior year period.  The decrease was in part due to a decrease of $0.8 million from the disposal of the QAD Business with the balance primarily from reductions in project revenues from several large clients that were not timely replaced.  Gross profit of $2.7 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 decreased 41.8%, or $2.0 million, as compared to $4.7 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenues and also a decrease in gross profit margin. The Information Technology gross profit margin for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 was 27.2% as compared to 30.9% for the comparable prior year period.  The decrease in gross profit margin was partially due to the disposal of the QAD Business which typically generated high gross profit margin from software sales.  Excluding the QAD Business, gross profit margin for the comparable prior year period was 30.7%.  Gross profit margin decreased because large project high-value, high-margin revenues decreased and thereby increased the portion of lower gross profit margin staffing oriented revenues.   Operating income was marginally positive for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to $1.0 million for the comparable prior year period.  The decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in gross profit offset by a decrease in SGA expense.  SGA expense of $2.6 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 decreased $1.1 million as compared to $3.7 million in the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the disposal of the QAD Business which generated SGA expense of $0.3 million for the comparable prior year period, a lower allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense and an overall concerted effort by the Company to reduce general and administrative expense.

Specialty Health Care

Specialty Health Care revenues of $12.0 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 increased 12.7%, or $1.3 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period.  The primary reason for the increase in the revenues for the Specialty Health Care segment was an increase of $1.3 million from the travel nursing staffing group. The Specialty Health Care segment's gross profit for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 decreased by 3.1%, or $0.1 million, as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the a decrease in gross profit margin to 25.9% for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to 30.0% for the comparable prior year period, offset by the increase in revenues. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by increased revenues with new clients at a lower gross profit margin, particularly in the travel nurse staffing group, and a decrease in high gross profit margin permanent placement revenues.  Specialty Health Care experienced an operating loss of $0.1 million for the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to operating income of $0.1 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary reasons for the decrease in operating income were the decrease in gross profit and an increase in SGA expense.  SGA expense increased by $0.1 million, primarily due to a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense.

The following table summarizes the major captions from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):

Operating Activities 

Operating activities provided $12.1 million of cash for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to $7.5 million in the comparable prior year period.  The major components of cash provided by or used in operating activities in the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net income and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs.

Net income for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 was $2.0 million as compared to $3.0 million for the comparable prior year period.  A decrease in accounts receivables in the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 provided $8.6 million of cash as compared to $3.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company primarily attributes the decrease in accounts receivables for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 to improved collections from its Specialty Health Care and Canada Engineering clients and a decrease in revenues for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to the thirty-nine week period ended October 3, 2015.

The Company's transit accounts payable generally exceeds the Company's transit accounts receivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business.  The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net liability of $2.4 million and $1.5 million as of October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively, so the cash impact during the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 provided $0.9 million in cash.  The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net liability of $0.6 million and $2.9 million as of October 3, 2015 and January 3, 2015, respectively, so the cash impact during the thirty-nine week period ended October 3, 2015 used $2.3 million in cash.  Prepaid expenses and other current assets provided $1.8 million of cash for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to using a negligible amount of cash in the comparable prior year period.  The Company attributes these changes to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.

A decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used $1.7 million for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to providing $0.3 million of cash for the comparable prior year period.  The Company attributes these changes to general timing of payments to vendors in the normal course of business.

The decrease in accrued payroll and related costs for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 used $2.3 million in cash as compared to providing $0.2 million for the comparable prior year period.  There are three primary factors that impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) the Company pays the majority of its employees every two weeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter: this means that the Company normally has a major payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 2) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and related costs is the Company's largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 3) most of the Company's senior management participate in annual incentive plans and while progress advances are often made during the fiscal year these accrued bonus balances to the extent they are projected to be achieved generally accumulate throughout the year. The Company's last major payroll for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2016 was paid on September 30, 2016, the final business day of the current period. The Company's last payroll for the fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2016 will be December 23, 2016, one week before the end of the Company's fiscal year.

Investing Activities 

Investing activities used cash of $0.7 million for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to $3.3 million in the comparable prior year period.  Investing activities were primarily related to expenditures for property and equipment.

The Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation.  The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its SAP financial reporting and accounting system, perhaps as early as some time in fiscal 2017.  The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of the SAP system will cost between $1.0 million and $2.0 million.  These estimates are subject to material change.

Financing Activities 

Financing activities used $12.1 million of cash for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 as compared to $5.2 million in the comparable prior year period.  The Company made net repayments under its line of credit of $9.8 million during the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016.  The Company also used $1.8 million to repurchase common stock during the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016.  The Company generated cash of $0.4 million for both the presented thirty-nine week periods from sales of shares from its equity plans.

Financing Activities (Continued) 

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to a loan agreement with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, amended and restated effective February 20, 2009, which provides for a $35 million revolving credit facility and includes a sub-limit of $5 million for letters of credit (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and expires December 11, 2019.  The Revolving Credit Facility has been amended several times, most recently pursuant to the Sixth Amendment entered into on June 13, 2016 when another daily borrowing rate option was added, and the Fifth Amendment entered into on December 14, 2015 when certain definitions, including without limitation those of terms that are elements of the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, including Applicable LIBOR Rate Margin, Applicable Prime Rate Margin, Fixed Charge Ratio, Letter of Credit Applicable Margin and Permitted Dividend.  The Amendment also deletes the definition of Modified Current Ratio.  The Fifth Amendment also revised certain provisions relating to unused line fees, permitted dividends, a permitted disposition, fees for unused availability under the revolving credit line and certain elements of the financial and operating covenants.  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing.  These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank's prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations.  The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn.  Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense.  The effective interest rate, including unused line fees, for the thirty-nine week period ended October 1, 2016 was 2.3%.

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries.  The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts on the Company's ability to borrow in order to pay dividends.  The Company paid special cash dividends on December 30, 2014 and December 30, 2015 which were expressly permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the line of credit as of October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 were $11.2 million and $21.0 million, respectively.  At October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 there were letters of credit outstanding for $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  At October 1, 2016, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $23.1 million.

Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes.  Funding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing transactions.  The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance.  Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations.

The Company's business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through strategic acquisitions.  The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.  The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration.   As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase however, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise.  In order to pursue such opportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future.  No assurance can be given as to the Company's future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed.

The Company's current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space.  The Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months.

The Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates through March 2022.  Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.  The minimum future annual operating lease commitments for leases with non-cancelable terms, exclusive of unknown operating escalation charges, are as follows (in thousands):

Future Contingent Payments 

As of October 1, 2016, the Company had three active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the former shareholders: 1) effective July 1, 2012 the Company acquired certain assets of BGA, LLC ("BGA"); 2) effective August 1, 2014 the Company acquired all of the stock of Point Comm, Inc. ("PCI"); and 3) effective July 5, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets of Substation Design Services, LLC ("SDS"). The Company estimates future contingent payments at October 1, 2016 as follows:

Estimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates.   Future contingent payments to be made to BGA, PCI and SDS are capped at cumulative maximums of $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  The Company estimates future contingent consideration in payments based on forecasted performance and recorded at the net present value of those expected payments as of  October 1, 2016 .  The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" (ASU Topic 820-10-35) refers to as Level 3 inputs.

ITEM 3.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio.  The Company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards.  The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company's investments consisted of cash and money market funds.  The Company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes.  Based on the Company's variable-rate line of credit balances during the thirteen week period ended October 1, 2016, if the interest rate on the Company's variable-rate line of credit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the Company's interest expense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.2 million.  The Company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio.

ITEM 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

A controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
