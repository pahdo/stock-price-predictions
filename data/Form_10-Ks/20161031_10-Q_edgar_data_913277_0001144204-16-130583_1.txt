NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of Black Diamond, Inc. and subsidiaries (which may be referred to as the  Company,   we, 
 us  or  our ) as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), instructions to Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S.
GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
except otherwise disclosed) necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been included. The results of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be obtained for the year ending December 31, 2016. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ). 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include a correction related to the carryback limitations of net operating
losses and tax credits to 2014 in the third quarter of 2015. The effect of the revision was to decrease income tax receivable
and reduce other long-term liabilities by $1,801 and $230, as of December 31, 2015, respectively, with an offsetting increase
of $1,571 of income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We evaluated these changes and determined
that the corrections are not material to the prior periods. 

On May 28, 2010, we acquired Black Diamond
Equipment, Ltd. (which may be referred to as  Black Diamond Equipment ) and Gregory Mountain Products, LLC (which
may be referred to as  Gregory Mountain Products ,  Gregory  or  GMP ). On January 20, 2011,
the Company changed its name from Clarus Corporation to Black Diamond, Inc. In July 2012, we acquired POC Sweden AB and its subsidiaries
(collectively,  POC ) and in October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively,  PIEPS ). 

On July 23, 2014, the Company and Gregory
Mountain Products, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the sale of certain assets to Samsonite LLC ( Samsonite )
comprising Gregory s business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling technical, alpine, backpacking,
hiking, mountaineering and active trail products and accessories as well as outdoor-inspired lifestyle bags (the  Gregory
Business ) pursuant to the terms of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the  GMP Purchase Agreement ), dated
as of June 18, 2014, by and among the Company, Gregory and Samsonite. Under the terms of the GMP Purchase Agreement, Samsonite
paid $84,135 in cash for Gregory s assets comprising the Gregory Business and assumed certain specified liabilities (the
 GMP Sale ). 

On March 16, 2015, the Company announced that
it engaged Rothschild Inc. and Robert W. Baird   Co., Incorporated as financial advisors to lead an exploration of a full
range of strategic alternatives, including a sale of the entire Company and the potential sales of the Company s Black Diamond
Equipment (including PIEPS) and POC brands in two separate transactions. 

On October 7, 2015, the Company and the Company s
wholly owned subsidiary, Ember Scandinavia AB ( Ember ), sold their respective equity interests in POC comprising
POC s business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling advanced-design helmets, body armor, goggles,
eyewear, gloves, and apparel for action or  gravity sports,  such as skiing, snowboarding, and cycling pursuant to
a Purchase Agreement (the  POC Purchase Agreement ), dated as of October 7, 2015, by and among the Company and Ember,
as sellers, and Dainese S.p.A. and Dainese U.S.A., Inc. (collectively  Dainese ), as purchasers. Under the terms of
the POC Purchase Agreement, Dainese paid $63,639 in cash for POC (the  POC Disposition ). Furthermore, the activities
of POC have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2, below. 

On October 8, 2015, the Company announced
the completion of the POC Disposition resulting in the conclusion of the Company s review of strategic alternatives. 

On November 9, 2015, the Company announced
that it is seeking to redeploy our significant cash balances to invest in high-quality, durable, cash flow-producing assets potentially
unrelated to the outdoor industry in order to diversify our business and potentially monetize our substantial net operating losses
as part of our asset redeployment and diversification strategy. We intend to focus our search primarily in the United States,
although we will also evaluate international investment opportunities should we find such opportunities attractive.

STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

Nature of Business  

Black Diamond, Inc., through its ownership
of Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd., is a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing innovative active outdoor performance
equipment and apparel for climbing, mountaineering, backpacking, skiing and a wide range of other year-round outdoor recreation
activities. Our principal brands include Black Diamond  and PIEPS  and are targeted not only to the demanding requirements
of core climbers, skiers and alpinists, but also to the more general outdoor performance enthusiasts and consumers interested
in outdoor-inspired gear for their backcountry and urban activities. Our Black Diamond  and PIEPS  brands are iconic
in the active outdoor and ski industries, and linked intrinsically with the modern history of these sports. We believe our brands
are synonymous with the performance, innovation, durability and safety that the outdoor and action sports communities rely on
and embrace in their active lifestyle. 

We offer a broad range of products including:
high performance apparel (such as jackets, shells, pants and bibs); rock-climbing equipment (such as carabiners, protection devices,
harnesses, belay devices, helmets and ice-climbing gear); technical backpacks and high-end day packs; tents; trekking poles; headlamps
and lanterns; and gloves and mittens. We also offer advanced skis, ski poles, ski bindings, ski skins, and ski safety products,
including avalanche airbag systems, avalanche transceivers, shovels and probes. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates relate to derivatives, revenue recognition, income taxes,
and valuation of long-lived assets and other intangible assets. Certain costs are estimated for the full year and allocated to
interim periods based on estimates of time expired, benefit received, or activity associated with the interim period. We base
our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. 

Significant Accounting Policies  

There have been no significant changes to
the Company s significant accounting policies as described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
 ASU 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance
Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period , A SU 2015-01,  Income Statement   Extraordinary
and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) , and ASU 2015-03, S implifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost.  
There was not a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated statements and related disclosures due to adoption
of these standards.  

Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet
Adopted  

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires
an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new
standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (periods beginning after December 15, 2016).
The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the
effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its current sales contracts and how revenue will be recognized in its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating which transition method it will use to implement the ASU
and the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The guidance requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions
or events, in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available
to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The guidance is effective
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.
We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated statements
and related disclosures.

In July 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower
of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value for entities that do not measure inventory using the last-in, first-out
or retail inventory method. The ASU also eliminates the requirement for these entities to consider replacement cost or net realizable
value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. The ASU requires prospective adoption and permits early adoption.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases , which revises the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to
recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. Leases will be classified
as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The
provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and should be applied through a modified
retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period
presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  
 The ASU changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting
for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory
tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds
shares for tax-withholding purposes. The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU will have on the Company s
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 ,
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  ASU 2016-10 amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers , about identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The provisions
of ASU 2016-10 are effective on adoption of ASU 2014-09.  The Company is evaluating the effect that
ASU 2016-10 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not determined the effect
of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,
 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  ASU 2016-12 makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers , and provides practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new standard and to clarify
certain aspects of the standard. The provisions of ASU 2016-12 are effective on adoption of ASU 2014-09.  The
Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company has not determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  

In August 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,  w hich
clarifies the treatment of several cash flow categories. In addition, ASU 2016-15 clarifies that when cash receipts and cash payments
have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, classification will depend on the predominant sourc e
or use.  The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the Company s
consolidated statements and related disclosures.  

NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

As discussed
above in Note 1, on October 7, 2015, the Company sold POC to Dainese. The Company received  $63,639 in cash for the POC
Disposition and paid $2,946 in transaction fees for net proceeds of $60,693. $739 of cash was sold as part of the transaction.
Also, as of December 31, 2015, there was an unsettled working capital adjustment of $921 owed to Dainese which was paid during
the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on such sale of $8,436.  The
Company performed certain transition services related to the POC Disposition and received $0 and $324, during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which was recorded as a reduction of  selling, general and administrative
expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements  for such periods .

NOTE 7. OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES  

Other long-term liabilities were $388 and
$1,812 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with $273 and $1,689 of the balance as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, relating to a pension liability with respect to the benefit plan maintained for the benefit
of the Company s employees in Switzerland. The decrease is primarily due to the termination of employees in Switzerland
as part of the move of the Company s Black Diamond European office from Basel, Switzerland to Innsbruck, Austria. The Company
also has an insurance policy whereby any underfunded amounts related to the pension liability are expected to be recoverable.
The Company has recorded a receivable of $273 and $1,689 as other long-term assets for the underfunded amount as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The significant assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit pension plan
were as follows:

NOTE 8. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

The Company s primary exchange rate
risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company primarily focuses on mitigating changes in cash flows resulting from sales denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages this risk primarily by using currency forward and option contracts. If the anticipated
transactions are deemed probable, the resulting relationships are formally designated as cash flow hedges. The Company accounts
for these contracts as cash flow hedges and tests effectiveness by determining whether changes in the expected cash flow of the
derivative offset, within a range, changes in the expected cash flow of the hedged item. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company s
derivative contracts had a remaining maturity of one and one-half years or less. The counterparty to these transactions had both
long-term and short-term investment grade credit ratings. The maximum net exposure of the Company s credit risk to the counterparty
is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized loss of all contracts with that counterparty, which is $115 as of September 30,
2016. The Company s exposure of counterparty credit risk is limited to the aggregate unrealized gain on all contracts. At
September 30, 2016, there was no such exposure to the counterparty. The Company s derivative counterparty has strong credit
ratings and as a result, the Company does not require collateral to facilitate transactions. 

The Company held the following contracts designated
as hedged instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

For contracts that qualify as effective hedge
instruments, the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the instruments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to sales in the period the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in
earnings. Gains (losses) of $(152) and $1,530 were reclassified to sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $(495) and $4,126 were reclassified to sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Gains of $76 and $183 were reclassified to discontinued operations, net of tax, during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The Company records ineffectiveness of hedged
instruments resulting from changes in fair value of the instruments in earnings. Gains (losses) of $34 and $(8) were recorded
to Other, net, associated with ineffective hedge instruments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. There
were no gains (losses) recorded to Other, net, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company reported
an accumulated derivative instrument loss of $68. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported accumulated
other comprehensive income of $70, as a result of the change in fair value of these contracts and reclassifications to sales and
other income as discussed above, resulting in an accumulated derivative instrument income of $2 reported as of September 30, 2016.

The effects on net loss of amounts reclassified
from unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges for foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency translation adjustments
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were as follows: 

The Company s policy is to classify
reclassifications of cumulative foreign currency translation from AOCI to Other, net. 

NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

We measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, under a three-tier fair value
hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1-  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market
prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2-  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices
in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability. 

Level 3-  inputs to the valuation methodology are based on prices
or valuation techniques that are unobservable. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

BLACK DIAMOND, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS - CONTINUED  

  (Unaudited)  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature and liquidity of
these financial instruments. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices. Derivative financial
instruments are recorded at fair value based on current market pricing models. The Company estimates that, based on current market
conditions, the fair value of its debt obligations under its revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes payable approximate
the carrying values at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements   

There were no assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2016. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
at December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

The Company has certain assets that are measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when impairment indicators are present.  The categorization of the framework used
to estimate the fair value of the assets is considered a Level 3, due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used
to determine the fair value.  The assets are adjusted to fair value only when the carrying values exceed the fair values.  Based
on the results of the Company s annual impairment tests completed during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company determined
that goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recognized impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2015.

NOTE 11. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings (loss)
per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the total of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period, plus the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock grants. Potentially dilutive
securities are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive to loss from continuing
operations. 

The following table is a reconciliation of
basic and diluted shares of common stock outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, equity awards of 2,517 and 2,995, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, equity awards
of 2,491 and 3,241, respectively, were outstanding and anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the calculation of loss per
share for these periods. 

NOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN  

Under the Company s current 2015 Stock
Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ) and the previous 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2005 Plan ), the Company s
Board of Directors (the  Board of Directors ) had flexibility to determine the type and amount of awards to be granted
to eligible participants, who must be employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries. The 2015
Plan allows for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
and restricted units. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be granted through awards under the 2015 Plan to
any employee in any calendar year may not exceed 500 shares. The 2005 Plan continued in effect until June 2015 when it expired
in accordance with its terms. The 2015 Plan will continue in effect until December 2025 unless terminated sooner.  

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued stock options for an aggregate of 163 shares under the 2015 Plan to directors and employees of the Company.
Of the 163 options issued, 38 options vest in four equal consecutive quarterly tranches from the date of grant. The remaining
125 options will vest in three installments as follows: 42 options shall vest on June 30, 2017, and the remaining options shall
vest equally on June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019.

STATEMENTS - CONTINUED  

  (Unaudited)  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

For computing the fair value of the stock-based
awards, the fair value of each option grant has been estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions: 

(a)  Expected volatility is based upon
                                         the Company s historical volatility.   

(b)  Because the Company does not have
                                         sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate
                                         the expected term for these grants, the Company utilized the simplified method in developing
                                         an estimate of the expected term of these options.   

On July 1, 2016, the Company issued and granted
to an employee a restricted stock award of 100 restricted shares under the 2015 Plan, which will vest if, on or before July 1,
2020, the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of the Company s common stock shall have equaled or exceeded $15.00
per share for twenty consecutive trading days. For computing the fair value of the 100 restricted shares with a market condition,
the fair value of each restricted stock award grant has been estimated as of the date of grant using the Monte-Carlo pricing model
with the assumptions below. 

Market Condition Restricted Shares Granted
on July 1, 2016  

The total non-cash stock compensation expense
for continuing operations related to restricted stock, stock options and stock awards recorded by the Company for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $42 and $126, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$193 and $1,028, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the majority of stock-based compensation
costs were classified as selling, general and administrative expense. The fair value of unvested restricted stock awards is determined
based on the market price of our shares of common stock on the grant date or using the Monte-Carlo pricing model. As of September
30, 2016, there were 350 unvested stock options and unrecognized compensation cost of $755 related to unvested stock options,
as well as 390 unvested restricted stock awards and unrecognized compensation cost of $126 related to unvested restricted stock
awards. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has unvested restricted stock awards which vest based upon satisfaction of a performance
condition. Achievement of the performance condition is currently not considered probable. Consequently, the Company has not recorded
compensation costs associated with the performance condition awards.

NOTE 13. RESTRUCTURING  

The Company initiated a restructuring plan
in the fourth quarter of 2014 ( 2014 Restructuring Plan ) to realign resources within the organization and anticipates
completing the plan in 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $0
and $427, respectively, related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred
restructuring charges of $20 and $2,303, respectively. We have incurred $5,959 of cumulative restructuring charges since the commencement
of the 2014 Restructuring Plan. We estimate that we will incur restructuring costs related to other exit costs during the remainder
of 2016. 

As part of the conclusion of the Company s
review of strategic alternatives, the Company initiated restructuring activities in efforts to further realign resources within
the organization ( 2015 Restructuring Plan ) and anticipates completing the plan in 2016. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $282 and $269, respectively, related to the 2015 Restructuring
Plan. During the nine months ended September 30 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $1,255 and $269, respectively.
We have incurred $2,274 of cumulative restructuring charges since the commencement of the 2015 Restructuring Plan. 

The following table summarizes the restructuring
charges, payments and the remaining accrual related to employee termination costs and facility exit costs.  

As of September 30, 2016, termination costs
and restructuring costs remained in accrued liabilities and are expected to be paid during the remainder of 2016. 

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

The Company is involved in various legal disputes
and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information,
the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its
subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.  There is a reasonable possibility
of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time.
 It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company could have a different effect. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company received an arbitral award on agreed terms of $1,967, related to certain claims against the former owner of
PIEPS associated with the voluntary recall of all of the PIEPS VECTOR avalanche transceivers during the year ended December 31,
2013. This concludes the arbitration in its entirety. 

The Company leases office, warehouse and distribution
space under non-cancelable operating leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that, in the normal course of business, certain
leases will be renewed or replaced. Certain lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses
rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term which commences on the date the Company has the right to control the property.
The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Total rent expense for continuing operations
of the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $204 and $352, respectively, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $826 and $1,195, respectively. 

NOTE 15. INCOME TAXES  

The Company s foreign operations that
are considered to be permanently reinvested have statutory tax rates of 25%. 

The tax expense recorded during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a discrete charge of $520 and $953, respectively, for an uncertain tax position
associated with the formal closure and liquidation of the Company s Black Diamond Equipment manufacturing operations in
Zhuhai, China. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company s
gross deferred tax asset was $72,859. The Company had recorded a valuation allowance of $64,486, resulting in a net deferred tax
asset of $8,373, before deferred tax liabilities of $17,342. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against a portion
of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, because the ultimate realization of those assets did not meet the more
likely than not criteria. The majority of the Company s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards
for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 ( Code ), as amended. 

In assessing the realizability of deferred
income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire.
The estimates and judgments associated with the Company s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets are considered critical
due to the amount of deferred tax assets recorded by the Company on its consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in
determining the Company s future taxable income. The need for a valuation allowance is reassessed at each interim reporting
period. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an increase to its valuation allowance of $48,858. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had net
operating loss, research and experimentation credit and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax
purposes of $166,206 ($294 relates to excess tax benefits related to share based payment compensation, which will not be recorded
until an income tax payable exists), $2,949 and $316, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal net operating loss ( NOL )
will substantially offset its future U.S. Federal income taxes, excluding the amount subject to U.S. Federal Alternative Minimum
Tax ( AMT ). AMT is calculated as 20% of AMT income. For purposes of AMT, a maximum of 90% of income is offset by
available NOLs. The majority of the Company s pre-tax income is currently earned and expected to be earned in the U.S.,
or taxed in the U.S. as Subpart F. income and will be offset with the NOL. 

NOLs available to offset taxable income, subject
to compliance with Section 382 of the Code, begin to expire based upon the following schedule:

NOTE 16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

5% Unsecured Subordinated Notes due May 28, 2017  

As part of the consideration payable to the
stockholders of Gregory when the Company acquired Gregory, the Company issued $14,517, $7,539, and $554 in 5% Unsecured Subordinated
Notes due May 28, 2017 (the  Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes ) to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, Schiller Gregory
Investment Company, LLC, and five former employees of Gregory, respectively. Mr. Warren B. Kanders, the Company s Executive
Chairman and a member of its Board of Directors, is a majority member and a trustee of the manager of Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC.
The sole manager of Schiller Gregory Investment Company, LLC is Mr. Robert R. Schiller, the Company s Executive Vice Chairman
and a member of its Board of Directors. The principal terms of the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes are as follows: (i)
the principal amount is due and payable on May 28, 2017 and is prepayable by the Company at any time; (ii) interest will accrue
on the principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum and shall be payable quarterly in cash; (iii) the default interest rate shall
accrue at the rate of 10% per annum during the occurrence of an event of default; and (iv) events of default, which can only be
triggered with the consent of Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, are: (a) the default by the Company on any payment due under a Merger
Consideration Subordinated Note; (b) the Company s failure to perform or observe any other material covenant or agreement
contained in the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes; or (c) the Company s instituting or becoming subject to a proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code (as defined in the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes). The Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes
are junior to all senior indebtedness of the Company, except that payments of interest continue to be made under the Merger Consideration
Subordinated Notes as long as no event of default exists under any senior indebtedness. 

Given the below market interest rate for comparably
secured notes and the relative illiquidity of the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes, we have discounted the notes to $8,640,
$4,487 and $316, respectively, at the date of acquisition. We are accreting the discount on the Merger Consideration Subordinated
Notes to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes. The
effective interest rate is approximately 14%. 

On April 7, 2011, Schiller Gregory Investment
Company, LLC transferred its Merger Consideration Subordinated Note in equal amounts to the Robert R. Schiller Cornerstone Trust
and the Deborah Schiller 2005 Revocable Trust. On June 24, 2013, the Robert R. Schiller Cornerstone Trust dated September 9, 2010
transferred its Merger Consideration Subordinated Note in the amount of $3,769 to the Robert R. Schiller 2013 Cornerstone Trust
dated June 24, 2013. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $181 and $544 in interest, respectively, was paid
to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, and $95 and $283 in interest, respectively, was paid to the Robert R. Schiller 2013 Cornerstone
Trust and the Deborah Schiller 2005 Revocable Trust pursuant to the outstanding Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes. 

On May 29, 2012 and August 13, 2012, five
former employees of Gregory exercised certain sales rights and sold Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of approximately $365 to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC and in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $189 to Schiller
Gregory Investment Company, LLC. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $5 and $14 in interest, respectively,
was paid to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, and $2 and $7 in interest, respectively, was paid to Schiller Gregory Investment Company,
LLC, pursuant to these outstanding Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes.

Overview  

Black Diamond, Inc. (which may be referred
to as the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ), through its ownership of Black Diamond
Equipment, Ltd., is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative active outdoor performance equipment
and apparel for climbing, mountaineering, backpacking, skiing and a wide range of other year-round outdoor recreation activities.
Our principal brands include Black Diamond  and PIEPS  and are targeted not only to the demanding requirements of core
climbers, skiers and alpinists, but also to the more general outdoor performance enthusiasts and consumers interested in outdoor-inspired
gear for their backcountry and urban activities. Our Black Diamond  and PIEPS  brands are iconic in the active outdoor
and ski industries, and linked intrinsically with the modern history of these sports. We believe our brands are synonymous with
the performance, innovation, durability and safety that the outdoor and action sports communities rely on and embrace in their
active lifestyle. 

We offer a broad range of products including:
high performance apparel (such as jackets, shells, pants and bibs); rock-climbing equipment (such as carabiners, protection devices,
harnesses, belay devices, helmets and ice-climbing gear); technical backpacks and high-end day packs; tents; trekking poles; headlamps
and lanterns; and gloves and mittens. We also offer advanced skis, ski poles, ski bindings, ski skins, and ski safety products,
including avalanche airbag systems, avalanche transceivers, shovels and probes. 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include a correction related to the carryback limitations of net operating
losses and tax credits to 2014 in the third quarter of 2015. The effect of the revision was to decrease income tax receivable
and reduce other long-term liabilities by $1,801 and $230, as of December 31, 2015, respectively, with an offsetting increase
of $1,571 of income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We evaluated these changes and determined
that the corrections are not material to the prior periods. 

On May 28, 2010, we acquired Black Diamond
Equipment, Ltd. (which may be referred to as  Black Diamond Equipment ) and Gregory Mountain Products, LLC (which
may be referred to as  Gregory Mountain Products ,  Gregory  or  GMP ). On January 20, 2011,
the Company changed its name from Clarus Corporation to Black Diamond, Inc. In July 2012, we acquired POC Sweden AB and its subsidiaries
(collectively,  POC ) and in October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively,  PIEPS ).

BLACK DIAMOND, INC.  

  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

On July 23, 2014, the Company and Gregory
Mountain Products, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the sale of certain assets to Samsonite LLC ( Samsonite )
comprising Gregory s business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling technical, alpine, backpacking,
hiking, mountaineering and active trail products and accessories as well as outdoor-inspired lifestyle bags (the  Gregory
Business ) pursuant to the terms of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the  GMP Purchase Agreement ), dated
as of June 18, 2014, by and among the Company, Gregory and Samsonite. Under the terms of the GMP Purchase Agreement, Samsonite
paid $84,135 in cash for Gregory s assets comprising the Gregory Business and assumed certain specified liabilities (the
 GMP Sale ). 

On March 16, 2015, the Company announced that
it engaged Rothschild Inc. and Robert W. Baird   Co., Incorporated as financial advisors to lead an exploration of a full
range of strategic alternatives, including a sale of the entire Company and the potential sales of the Company s Black Diamond
Equipment (including PIEPS) and POC brands in two separate transactions. 

On October 7, 2015, the Company and the Company s
wholly owned subsidiary, Ember Scandinavia AB ( Ember ), sold their respective equity interests in POC comprising
POC s business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling advanced-design helmets, body armor, goggles,
eyewear, gloves, and apparel for action or  gravity sports,  such as skiing, snowboarding, and cycling pursuant to
a Purchase Agreement (the  POC Purchase Agreement ), dated as of October 7, 2015, by and among the Company and Ember,
as sellers, and Dainese S.p.A. and Dainese U.S.A., Inc. (collectively  Dainese ), as purchasers. Under the terms of
the POC Purchase Agreement, Dainese paid $63,639 in cash for POC (the  POC Disposition ). Furthermore, the activities
of POC have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 to the notes to the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On October 8, 2015, the Company announced
the completion of the POC Disposition resulting in the conclusion of the Company s review of strategic alternatives. 

On November 9, 2015, the Company announced
that it is seeking to redeploy our significant cash balances to invest in high-quality, durable, cash flow-producing assets potentially
unrelated to the outdoor industry in order to diversify our business and potentially monetize our substantial net operating losses
as part of our asset redeployment and diversification strategy. We intend to focus our search primarily in the United States,
although we will also evaluate international investment opportunities should we find such opportunities attractive. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates  

Management s discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on the condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related
to derivatives, revenue recognition, income taxes and valuation of long-lived assets and other intangible assets. We base our
estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. 

There have been no significant changes to
our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except elimination
of the policy associated with the evaluation of the valuation of goodwill, as goodwill was fully impaired during the year ended
December 31, 2015.

Results of Operations  

Condensed Consolidated Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Condensed Consolidated Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following presents a discussion of consolidated
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the consolidated three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Sales  

Consolidated sales increased $185, or 0.5%,
to $39,441 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated sales of $39,256 during the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity of new and existing
climb and mountain products sold during the period, which was partially offset by a decrease in sales of $1,131 due to the weakening
of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior period. 

Consolidated domestic sales increased $754,
or 4.4%, to $17,939 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated domestic sales of $17,185 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in domestic sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity
of new and existing climb and mountain products sold during the period.

  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

Consolidated international sales decreased
$569, or 2.6%, to $21,502 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated international sales of $22,071
during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in international sales was primarily attributable to a decrease
in sales of $1,131 due to the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the prior period and a decrease in the quantity of new and existing ski products sold during the period.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the quantity of new and existing climb and mountain products sold during
the period. 

Cost of Goods Sold  

Consolidated cost of goods sold increased
$1,992, or 7.9%, to $27,105 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated cost of goods sold of $25,113
during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to an increase
in the sales and an increase in the cost of the products sold as a result of the continued ramping-up of the Company s manufacturing
activities that were transferred from China to the United States. 

Gross Profit  

Consolidated gross profit decreased $1,807,
or 12.8%, to $12,336 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated gross profit of $14,143 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated gross margin was 31.3% during the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to a consolidated gross margin of 36.0% during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated gross margin during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased compared to the prior year due primarily to the weakening of foreign currencies
against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior period and due to an unfavorable
mix in lower margin products and channel distribution. 

Selling, General and Administrative  

Consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased $2,760, or 19.4%, to $11,483 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated selling,
general, and administrative expenses of $14,243 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling, general
and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the Company s realization of savings from its restructuring plan
implemented during 2015 to further realign resources within the organization. 

Restructuring Charges  

Consolidated restructuring expense decreased
$414, or 59.5%, to $282 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated restructuring expense of $696
during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Restructuring expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30,
2016 primarily related to costs associated with the move of the Company s Black Diamond Equipment European office from Basel,
Switzerland to Innsbruck, Austria, and costs associated with the formal closure and liquidation of the Company s Black Diamond
Equipment manufacturing operations in Zhuhai, China. 

Transaction Costs  

Consolidated transaction expense decreased
to $0 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated transaction costs of $39 during the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Expense, net  

Consolidated interest expense, net, increased
$14, or 2.0%, to $719 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated interest expense, net, of $705
during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense, net, was primarily attributable to the increase
in accretion expense associated with the Company s 5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017, which accretion is being amortized
utilizing the effective interest rate method. 

Other, net  

Consolidated other, net, income decreased
$274, or 39.4%, to $422 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to consolidated other, net income of $696 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other, net, was primarily attributable to losses related to recognition
of cumulative translation adjustments due to the substantial liquidation of a foreign entity and decreases in gains on mark-to-market
adjustments on non-hedged foreign currency contracts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in remeasurement gains
recognized on the Company s foreign denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable and gains related to the sale of
marketable securities.

Income Taxes  

Consolidated income tax expense decreased
$49,279, or 98.6%, to $679 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a consolidated income tax expense of
$49,958 during the same period in 2015. The tax expense recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes a discrete
charge of $520 for an uncertain tax position associated with the formal closure and liquidation of the Company s Black Diamond
Equipment manufacturing operations in Zhuhai, China. The decrease in tax expense is due to the Company recording an increase in
its valuation allowance of $50,770 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change in valuation allowance resulted
in a discrete charge to income tax expense of $49,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Certain events and circumstances
transpired during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which caused the Company to conclude that realization of some portion
of deferred tax assets does not satisfy the more-likely-than-not threshold. 

Our effective income tax rate was 247.8% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 5,919.2% for the same period in 2015. Factors that could cause our annual
effective tax rate to differ materially from our quarterly effective tax rates include changes in the geographic mix of taxable
income and discrete events that may occur. There was one discrete event in the amount of $520 recorded in the Company s
effective income tax rate calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2016. As mentioned above, the change in valuation
allowance resulted in a discrete charge to income tax expense of $49,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Discontinued Operations  

The Company sold POC for $63,639 effective
October 7, 2015 and as a result we recognized a pre-tax gain of $8,436. Discontinued operations decreased to $0 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to income from discontinued operations of $1,107 during the three months ended September
30, 2015. There was no activity for POC during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Results of Operations  

Condensed Consolidated Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 Compared to Condensed Consolidated Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following presents a discussion of consolidated
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the consolidated nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Sales  

Consolidated sales decreased $4,400, or 4.0%,
to $106,790 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated sales of $111,190 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of $4,307 due to the weakening
of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior period and
a decrease in the quantity of new and existing ski products sold during the period. The decrease was partially offset by an increase
in the quantity of new and existing climb and mountain products sold during the period.

BLACK DIAMOND, INC.  

  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

Consolidated domestic sales increased $2,198,
or 4.2%, to $54,190 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated domestic sales of $51,992 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in domestic sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity
of new and existing climb and mountain products sold during the period. 

Consolidated international sales decreased
$6,598, or 11.1%, to $52,600 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated international sales of
$59,198 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in international sales was primarily attributable to a decrease
in sales of $4,307 due to the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the prior period and a decrease in the quantity of new and existing ski products sold during the period. 

Cost of Goods Sold  

Consolidated cost of goods sold increased
$3,444, or 4.8%, to $75,155 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated cost of goods sold of $71,711
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to an increase
in the cost of the products sold as a result of the continued ramping-up of the Company s manufacturing activities that
were transferred from China to the United States and an increase in the number of units sold. 

Gross Profit  

Consolidated gross profit decreased $7,844,
or 19.9%, to $31,635 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated gross profit of $39,479 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated gross margin was 29.6% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to a consolidated gross margin of 35.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated gross margin during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the weakening of foreign currencies
against the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior period, additional costs associated
with the continued ramping-up of the Company s manufacturing activities that were transferred from China to the United States,
and the write-off of inventory shipped to certain North American accounts during the first quarter of 2016 that filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in April 2016. 

Selling, General and Administrative  

Consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased $6,159, or 14.2%, to $37,311 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated selling,
general, and administrative expenses of $43,470 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling, general
and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the Company s realization of savings from its restructuring plan
implemented during 2015 to further realign resources within the organization. 

Restructuring Charges  

Consolidated restructuring expense decreased
$1,297, or 50.4%, to $1,275 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated restructuring expense of
$2,572 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Restructuring expenses incurred during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, primarily related to benefits provided to employees who were or will be terminated due to the Company s reduction-in-force
as part of its continued realignment of resources within the organization, costs associated with the move of the Company s
Black Diamond Equipment European office from Basel, Switzerland to Innsbruck, Austria, and costs associated with the formal closure
and liquidation of the Company s Black Diamond Equipment manufacturing operations in Zhuhai, China. 

Transaction Costs  

Consolidated transaction expense decreased
$177, or 39.7%, to $269 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated transaction costs of $446 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which consisted of expenses related to the Company s redeployment and diversification
strategy. 

Arbitration Award  

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company received an arbitral award on agreed terms of $1,967, related to certain claims against the former owner of
PIEPS associated with the voluntary recall of all of the PIEPS VECTOR avalanche transceivers during the year ended December 31,
2013.

  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

Interest Expense, net  

Consolidated interest expense, net, increased
$69, or 3.3%, to $2,142 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated interest expense, net, of $2,073
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense, net, was primarily attributable to the increase
in accretion expense associated with the Company s 5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017, which accretion is being amortized
utilizing the effective interest rate method. 

Other, net  

Consolidated other, net, increased $480, or
138.7%, to income of $826 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to consolidated other, net income of $346 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other, net, was primarily attributable to an increase in remeasurement
gains recognized on the Company s foreign denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, decreases in losses on mark-to-market
adjustments on non-hedged foreign currency contracts, and gains related to the sale of marketable securities. These increases
were partially offset by losses related to recognition of cumulative translation adjustments due to the substantial liquidation
of a foreign entity. 

Income Taxes  

Consolidated income tax expense decreased
$46,631, or 97.9%, to $1,020 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a consolidated income tax expense of
$47,651 during the same period in 2015. The tax expense recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a discrete
charge for a Swiss withholding tax related to the transferring of Black Diamond Equipment s European operations from Basel,
Switzerland to Innsbruck, Austria, and a discrete charge of $953 for an uncertain tax position associated with the formal closure
and liquidation of the Company s Black Diamond Equipment manufacturing operations in Zhuhai, China. The increase in tax
expense is due the Company recording an increase in its valuation allowance of $50,770 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The change in valuation allowance resulted in a discrete charge to income tax expense of $49,911 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Certain events and circumstances transpired during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which
caused the Company to conclude that realization of some portion of deferred tax assets does not satisfy the more-likely-than-not
threshold. 

Our effective income tax rate was 15.5% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 545.5% for the same period in 2015. Factors that could cause our annual
effective tax rate to differ materially from our quarterly effective tax rates include changes in the geographic mix of taxable
income and discrete events that may occur. There were two discrete events in the amount of $1,117 recorded in the Company s
effective income tax rate calculation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Factors that could cause our annual effective
tax rate to differ materially from our quarterly effective tax rates include changes in the geographic mix of taxable income and
discrete events that may occur. As mentioned above, the change in valuation allowance resulted in a discrete charge to income
tax expense of $49,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Discontinued Operations  

The Company sold POC for $63,639 effective
October 7, 2015 and as a result we recognized a pre-tax gain of $8,436. Discontinued operations decreased to $0 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $430 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. There was no activity for POC during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Condensed Consolidated Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 Compared to Condensed Consolidated Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following presents a discussion of cash
flows for the consolidated nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared with the consolidated nine months ended September 30,
2015. Our primary ongoing funding requirements are for working capital, expansion of our operations and general corporate needs,
as well as investing activities associated with the expansion into new product categories. We plan to fund our future expansion
of operations and investing activities through a combination of our future operating cash flows, revolving credit facility, and
the net proceeds from the sales of GMP and POC. We believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months will
be adequately covered by existing cash, cash provided by operations and our existing revolving credit facility. At September 30,
2016, we had total cash of $95,955, compared with a cash balance of $88,401 and marketable securities of $9,824 at December 31,
2015, which was substantially all controlled by the Company s U.S. entities. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $13,858
of the $95,955 in cash held by foreign entities, of which $270 is considered permanently reinvested. The cash held by foreign
entities is available for repatriation and would result in an estimated tax liability of $3,696. This tax liability could be offset
by the Company s net operating loss carryforwards.

Net Cash From Operating Activities  

Consolidated net cash provided by operating
activities was $5,405 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated net cash used in operating activities
of $4,895 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016
is primarily due to a decrease in net operating assets or non-cash working capital of $12,917 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. 

Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided
by operating activities less capital expenditures, was free cash flows provided of $3,369 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to free cash flows used of $7,209 during the same period in 2015. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measure,
free cash flow, provides an understanding of the capital required by the Company to expand its asset base. A reconciliation of
free cash flows to comparable GAAP financial measures is set forth below:  

Net Cash From Investing Activities  

Consolidated net cash provided by investing
activities was $7,301 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated net cash used in investing activities
of $2,038 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 is primarily due to the sale of marketable securities of $10,235 and a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment,
partially offset by a purchase price adjustment related to the POC sale of $921 that was paid during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

Net Cash From Financing Activities  

Consolidated net cash used in financing activities
was $5,222 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to consolidated cash provided by financing activities of
$2,563 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relates
to the repurchase of the Company s common stock. The cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily
a result of net borrowings on the foreign credit facilities.

  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

Net Operating Loss   

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had net
operating loss, research and experimentation credit and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax
purposes of $166,206 ($294 relates to excess tax benefits related to share based payment compensation, which will not be realized
until an income tax payable exists), $2,949 and $316, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal net operating loss ( NOL )
will substantially offset its future U.S. Federal income taxes, excluding the amount subject to U.S. Federal Alternative Minimum
Tax ( AMT ). AMT is calculated as 20% of AMT income. For purposes of AMT, a maximum of 90% of income is offset by
available NOLs. The majority of the Company s pre-tax income is currently earned and expected to be earned in the U.S.,
or taxed in the U.S. as Subpart F income and will be offset with the NOL. $165,912 of net operating losses available to offset
taxable income does not expire until 2021 or later, subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company s
gross deferred tax asset was $72,859. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $64,486, resulting in a net deferred tax
asset of $8,373, before deferred tax liabilities of $17,342. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against a portion
of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, because the ultimate realization of those assets does not meet the more
likely than not criteria. The majority of the Company s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards
for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 ( Code ), as amended. 

Revolving Credit Facility   

On October 31, 2014, the Company together
with its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement (the  Second
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement ) with Zions First National Bank (the  Lender ), which matures on April
1, 2017. Under the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Company has a $30,000 revolving line of credit (the  Revolving
Line of Credit ) pursuant to a second amended and restated promissory note (revolving loan) (the  Revolving Line of
Credit Promissory Note ) which is inclusive of a $10,000 accordion option (the  Accordion ) available to the
Company to increase the Revolving Line of Credit on a seasonal or permanent basis for funding general corporate needs including
working capital, capital expenditures, permitted loans or investments in subsidiaries, and the issuance of letters of credit.
Also pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Company terminated its outstanding term loan facility which
previously allowed the Company to borrow up to $10,000 and certain additional changes were made to the original amended and restated
loan agreement and the covenants contained therein. 

All debt associated with the Second Amended
and Restated Loan Agreement bears interest at one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable
margin as determined by the ratio of Total Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA as follows: (i) one month LIBOR plus 4.00%
per annum at all times that Total Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00; (ii) one
month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum at all times that Total Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA ratio is greater than 1.00
and less than 2.00; and (iii) one month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum at all times that Total Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month
EBITDA ratio is less than 1.00 or if the Company has cash or marketable securities equal to or greater than $30,000. The Second
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement requires the payment of any unused commitment fee of (i) .6% per annum at all times that Total
Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00; (ii) .5% per annum at all times that Total
Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA ratio is greater than 1.00 and less than 2.00; and (iii) .4% per annum at all times
that Total Senior Debt to Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA ratio is less than 1.00. 

The Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement
contains certain restrictive debt covenants that require the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain an EBITDA based minimum
Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA, a minimum net worth, a positive amount of asset coverage, and limitations on capital expenditures
all as calculated in the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. In addition, the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement
contains covenants restricting the Company and its subsidiaries from pledging or encumbering their assets, with certain exceptions,
and from engaging in acquisitions other than acquisitions permitted by the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Second
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (with grace periods where customary) including, among
other things, failure to pay any principal or interest when due; any materially false or misleading representation, warranty,
or financial statement; failure to comply with or to perform any provision of the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement;
and default on any debt or agreement in excess of certain amounts. 

On November 9, 2015, the Company together
with its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries entered into a first amendment (the  First Amendment ) to the Second
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with the Lender. Pursuant to the First Amendment the minimum net worth financial covenant
required to be maintained by the Company and each of its domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries was reduced and certain additional
changes were also made to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. 

On March 11, 2016, the Company together with
its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries entered into a second amendment (the  Second Amendment ) to the Second
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement as amended by the First Amendment with the Lender. Pursuant to the Second Amendment the minimum
net worth financial covenant required to be maintained by the Company and each of its domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries for the
year ending December 31, 2015 was reduced from $170,000 to $140,000 with an annual increase of $2,000 for each fiscal year thereafter,

5% Senior Subordinated Notes due May
28, 2017   

As part of the consideration payable to the
stockholders of Gregory when the Company acquired Gregory, the Company issued $14,517, $7,539, and $554 in 5% Unsecured Subordinated
Notes due May 28, 2017 (the  Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes ) to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, Schiller Gregory
Investment Company, LLC, and five former employees of Gregory, respectively. Mr. Warren B. Kanders, the Company s Executive
Chairman and a member of its Board of Directors, is a majority member and a trustee of the manager of Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC.
The sole manager of Schiller Gregory Investment Company, LLC is Mr. Robert R. Schiller, the Company s Executive Vice Chairman
and a member of its Board of Directors. The principal terms of the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes are as follows: (i)
the principal amount is due and payable on May 28, 2017 and is prepayable by the Company at any time; (ii) interest will accrue
on the principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum and shall be payable quarterly in cash; (iii) the default interest rate shall
accrue at the rate of 10% per annum during the occurrence of an event of default; and (iv) events of default, which can only be
triggered with the consent of Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, are: (a) the default by the Company on any payment due under a Merger
Consideration Subordinated Note; (b) the Company s failure to perform or observe any other material covenant or agreement
contained in the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes; or (c) the Company s instituting or becoming subject to a proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code (as defined in the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes). The Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes
are junior to all senior indebtedness of the Company, except that payments of interest continue to be made under the Merger Consideration
Subordinated Notes as long as no event of default exists under any senior indebtedness. 

Given the below market interest rate for comparably
secured notes and the relative illiquidity of the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes, we have discounted the notes to $8,640,
$4,487 and $316, respectively, at the date of acquisition. We are accreting the discount on the Merger Consideration Subordinated
Notes to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes. The
effective interest rate is approximately 14%. 

On April 7, 2011, Schiller Gregory Investment
Company, LLC transferred its Merger Consideration Subordinated Note in equal amounts to the Robert R. Schiller Cornerstone Trust
and the Deborah Schiller 2005 Revocable Trust. On June 24, 2013, the Robert R. Schiller Cornerstone Trust dated September 9, 2010
transferred its Merger Consideration Subordinated Note in the amount of $3,769 to the Robert R. Schiller 2013 Cornerstone Trust
dated June 24, 2013. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $181 and $544 in interest, respectively, was paid
to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, and $95 and $283 in interest, respectively, was paid to the Robert R. Schiller 2013 Cornerstone
Trust and the Deborah Schiller 2005 Revocable Trust pursuant to the outstanding Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes. 

On May 29, 2012 and August 13, 2012, five
former employees of Gregory exercised certain sales rights and sold Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of approximately $365 to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC and in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $189 to Schiller
Gregory Investment Company, LLC. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $5 and $14 in interest, respectively,
was paid to Kanders GMP Holdings, LLC, and $2 and $7 in interest, respectively, was paid to Schiller Gregory Investment Company,
LLC, pursuant to these outstanding Merger Consideration Subordinated Notes.

  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company s management carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Executive Chairman and Chief Administrative
Officer/Chief Financial Officer, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2016, pursuant
to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding
disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Executive Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer/Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

Legal Proceedings  

The Company is involved in various legal disputes
and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information,
the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its
subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.  There is a reasonable possibility
of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time.
 It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company could have a different effect. 

Litigation  

The Company is involved in various lawsuits
arising from time to time that the Company considers ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business. Amounts accrued for
litigation matters represent the anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation and
claims. The costs are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
The accruals are based upon the Company s assessment, after consultation with counsel (if deemed appropriate), of probable
loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of
the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiffs and other significant factors that vary by case. When it
is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of probable loss and records
the minimum end of the range. Based on current information, the Company believes that the ultimate conclusion of the various pending
litigations of the Company, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Product Liability  

As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor,
the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages, product recall
actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The Company is therefore vulnerable to
various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its business. 

Based on current information, there are no
pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the Company, which the Company believes in the aggregate will have a material
adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

There have been no material changes in our
risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS  

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities   

The Company did not sell any securities during
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities   

On November 9, 2015, the Company announced
that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that allows the repurchase of up to $30,000,000 of the Company s
outstanding common stock. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company purchased 277,656 shares of the Company s common
stock for $1,255,500 under the Company s authorized stock repurchase program.
