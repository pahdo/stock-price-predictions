NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September 30, 2016

(Unaudited)

A.     Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 

Unless we have indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this report to  Associated Capital Group, Inc.,   AC Group,   the Company,   AC,   we,   us  and  our  or similar terms are to Associated Capital Group, Inc., its predecessors and its subsidiaries.

The Spin-off and Related Transactions

We are a Delaware corporation organized to be the parent operating company for the spin-off of GAMCO Investors, Inc. s ( GAMCO s ) alternative investment management business, institutional research services operations and certain cash and other assets. 

On November 30, 2015, GAMCO distributed all the outstanding shares of each class of common stock of AC Group on a pro rata one-for-one basis to the holders of each class of GAMCO s common stock.  Prior to the distribution, GAMCO contributed the 93.9% interest it held in Gabelli Securities, Inc. ( GSI ) and certain cash and other assets to AC Group. GSI is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. GSI and its wholly owned subsidiary, Gabelli   Partners, LLC ("Gabelli   Partners"), collectively serve as general partners or investment managers to investment funds including limited partnerships and offshore companies (collectively, "Investment Partnerships"), and separate accounts. We primarily manage assets in equity event-driven value strategies, across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios. The business earns fees from its advisory assets, and income (loss) from trading and investment portfolio activities. The advisory fees include management and incentive fees. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of the portfolios' levels of assets under management. Incentive fees are based on the percentage of profits derived from the investment performance delivered to clients' invested assets.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AC purchased the 6.1% of GSI shares owned by third parties in exchange for 163,428 Class A shares of the Company. GSI is now a wholly owned subsidiary of AC.

We operate our institutional research services operations through G.research, LLC ("G.research"), a wholly owned subsidiary of GSI. G.research is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Through G.research, we provide institutional research services as well as act as an underwriter. G.research is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). G.research's revenues are derived primarily from institutional research services.

In addition, the following transactions were also undertaken in connection with the spin-off:

GAMCO issued a promissory note (the  GAMCO Note ) to AC Group in the original principal amount of $250.0 million used to partially capitalize the Company in connection with the spin-off. The GAMCO Note bears interest at 4.0% per annum and has a maturity date of November 30, 2020 with respect to the original principal amount of the GAMCO Note. Interest on the GAMCO Note will accrue from the most recent date for which interest has been paid, or if no interest has been paid, from the effective date of the GAMCO Note; provided, however, that at the election of GAMCO, payment of interest on the GAMCO Note may, in lieu of being paid in cash, be paid, in whole or in part, in kind on the then-outstanding principal amount (a  PIK Amount ).   GAMCO will repay all PIK Amounts added to the outstanding principal amount of the GAMCO Note, in cash, on the fifth anniversary of the date on which each such PIK Amount was added to the outstanding principal amount of the GAMCO Note.  In no event may any interest be paid in kind subsequent to November 30, 2019.  GAMCO may prepay the GAMCO Note prior to maturity without penalty. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, AC received principal repayments totaling $150 million on the GAMCO Note.  $50 million of the prepayment was applied against the principal amount due on November 30, 2016, $40 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2017, $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2018, and $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2019.  Of the $100 million principal amount outstanding, $10 million is due on November 30, 2017, $20 million is due on November 30, 2018, $20 million is due on November 30, 2019, and $50 million is due on November 30, 2020. 

In addition, AC Group, through GSI, owns 4,393,055 shares of GAMCO Class A common stock.  The sale was made from GAMCO to GSI in advance of the spin-off.  GSI paid the purchase price by issuing a note to GAMCO in the principal amount of $150 million (the  GSI Note ).  In connection with the spin-off, AC Group received the GSI Note from GAMCO and GSI became a subsidiary of AC Group. The GSI Note is thus now an intercompany note within the AC Group.  

10 

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AC Group and its subsidiaries.  Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.

The Company's interim condensed combined consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2015, and the Company's interim condensed combined consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of GAMCO and are presented as carve-out financial statements as the Company was not a standalone public company prior to the spin-off.  For the periods prior to the spin-off of the Company from GAMCO, the combined consolidated financial statements include allocations from GAMCO.  These allocations may not be reflective of the actual level of assets, liabilities, income or costs which would have been incurred had the Company operated as a separate legal entity apart from GAMCO.

The Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are presented based on our actual results as a stand-alone public company subsequent to our spin-off.  References within these Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the condensed combined consolidated statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2015 shall hereinafter be referred to as the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  References within these Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the condensed combined consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 shall hereinafter be referred to as the condensed consolidated statements of income.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Developments

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in the Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the Codification.  The core principle of the new ASU No. 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue from the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers and also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition.  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods and is to be retrospectively applied.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance amending the current disclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value ( NAV ) per share.  The guidance requires investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy.  Instead, those investment amounts shall be provided as a separate item to permit reconciliation of the fair value of investments included in the fair value hierarchy to the line items presented in the statement of financial condition.  This new guidance was effective for the Company's first quarter of 2016 and was applied retrospectively.

11 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. For public companies, the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. To adopt the amendments, entities will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP for the accounting for leases.  ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities arising from most operating leases in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position.  ASU 2016-02 is effective beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which adds and clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  For public companies, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

B.     Investment in Securities 

Investments in securities (including GBL stock) at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 consisted of the following:

Securities sold, not yet purchased at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 consisted of the following:

12 

Investments in affiliated registered investment companies at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 consisted of the following:

Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of the date of each consolidated statement of financial condition.  Investments in United States Treasury Bills and Notes with maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase are classified as investments in securities, and those with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.  The portion of investments in securities held for resale in anticipation of short-term market movements are classified as trading securities.  Trading securities are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings.  Available for sale ( AFS ) investments are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of equity except for losses deemed to be other than temporary ( OTT ) which are recorded as realized losses in the condensed consolidated statements of income.

The Company recognizes all equity derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value and includes them in either investments in securities or securities sold, not yet purchased on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  From time to time, the Company and/or the partnerships and offshore funds that the Company consolidates will enter into hedging transactions to manage their exposure to foreign currencies and equity prices related to their proprietary investments.  At September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, we held derivative contracts on 24,000 equity shares, 250,000 equity shares and 170,000 equity shares, respectively, that are included in investments in securities or securities sold, not yet purchased on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.   We had two foreign exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 that are included in receivable from brokers or payable to brokers on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  Aside from one foreign exchange contract at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, these transactions are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and therefore changes in fair values of these derivatives are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the condensed consolidated statements of income.  The one foreign exchange contract that was designated as a hedge was for a short of British Pounds to hedge the long investment that we have in the London Stock Exchange listed Gabelli Value Plus+ Trust Ltd. closed-end fund which is denominated in British Pounds.  As the underlying investment that is being hedged is an available for sale security, the portion of the change in value of the closed-end fund that is currency related is recorded in net gain/(loss) from investments on the condensed consolidated statements of income and not in accumulated comprehensive income.

The following tables identify the fair values and gains and losses of all derivatives held by the Company (in thousands):

14 

The Company is a party to enforceable master netting arrangements for swaps entered into as part of the investment strategy of the Company s proprietary portfolio.  They are typically not used as hedging instruments.  These swaps, while settled on a net basis with the counterparties, major U.S. financial institutions, are shown gross in assets and liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  The swaps have a firm contract end date and are closed out and settled when each contract expires. 

The following is a summary of the cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value of available for sale investments as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015:

15 

Changes in net unrealized losses, net of taxes, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 of $9.3 million and $4.6 million in losses, respectively, have been included in other comprehensive loss, a component of equity, at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  Return of capital on available for sale securities was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were no proceeds from the sales of investments available for sale and no gross gains on the sale of investments available for sale.  There were no losses on the sale of investments available for sale for the three months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. Changes in net unrealized losses, net of taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 of $4.8 million and $4.4 million in losses, respectively, have been included in other comprehensive loss, a component of equity, at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  Return of capital on available for sale securities was $0.8 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  Proceeds from sales of investments available for sale were approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gross gains on the sale of investments available for sale amounted to $0.3 million and $0.03 million and were reclassified from other comprehensive income into net gain/(loss) from investments in the condensed consolidated statements of income. There were no losses on the sale of investments available for sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. The cost basis of a security sold is determined using specific identification.

Investments classified as available for sale that are in an unrealized loss position for which other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized consisted of the following:

At September 30, 2016, there were two holdings in loss positions that were not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to the length of time that they had been in a loss position and because they passed scrutiny in our evaluation of issuer-specific and industry-specific considerations. In these specific instances, one of the investments at September 30, 2016 was a closed-end fund with diversified holdings across multiple companies and across multiple industries. This holding was impaired for one month at September 30, 2016. The second holding was a common stock and was impaired for four months. The value of these holdings at September 30, 2016 was $128.2 million. If these holdings were to continue to be impaired, we may need to record impairment in a future period on the condensed consolidated statement of income for the amount of unrealized loss, which at September 30, 2016 was $24.9 million.

At December 31, 2015, there were six holdings in loss positions that were not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to the length of time that they had been in a loss position and because they passed scrutiny in our evaluation of issuer-specific and industry-specific considerations. In these specific instances, five of the investments at December 31, 2015 were mutual funds and closed-end funds with diversified holdings across multiple companies and across multiple industries. Of the fund investments, two holdings were impaired for one month, one for six months, and two for seven months at December 31, 2015. The sixth holding was a common stock and was impaired for one month. The value of these holdings at December 31, 2015 was $176.4 million. If these holdings were to continue to be impaired, we may need to record impairment in a future period on the condensed consolidated statement of income for the amount of unrealized loss, which at December 31, 2015 was $14.4 million.

At September 30, 2015, there were four holdings in loss positions which were not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to the length of time that they had been in a loss position and because they passed scrutiny in our evaluation of issuer-specific and industry-specific considerations. In these specific instances, the investments at September 30, 2015 were mutual funds and closed-end funds with diversified holdings across multiple companies and across multiple industries. One holding was impaired for two months, one holding was impaired for three months, one holding was impaired for seven months and one holding was impaired for eight months at September 30, 2015. The value of these holdings at September 30, 2015 was $37.9 million.

There were no losses recognized on AFS securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were $0.3 million in losses recognized on AFS securities.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were $0.2 million in losses recognized on AFS securities.

C.     Fair Value 

The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities by major categories measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.  Note that the FASB issued new guidance effective for the Company s first quarter of 2016 amending the current disclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share.  The guidance requires investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient to be removed from the fair value hierarchy.  Instead, those investment amounts are provided as a separate item to permit reconciliation of the fair value of investments included in the fair value hierarchy to the line items presented in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis as of September 30, 2015 (in thousands)

(a)

Amounts are comprised of certain investments measured at fair value using NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.  These investments have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy (see Note A,  Recent Accounting Developments , for more detail).

(b)

Amounts are comprised of certain equity method investments which are not accounted for under a fair value measure.  In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and liabilities under fair value measures; therefore, the Company s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value.

The following tables present additional information about assets by major categories measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value:

Changes in Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 (in thousands)

There were no transfers between any Levels during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

There were securities with a value of $0.4 million that were transferred out of Level 3 as a result of the deconsolidation of an offshore fund during the first quarter of 2015 which are reflected in sales above.  There were no transfers between Levels 1 or 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

D.    Investments in Partnerships, Offshore Funds and Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) 

The Company is general partner or co-general partner of various affiliated entities in which the Company has investments totaling $113.4 million, $89.3 million and $87.2 million at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and whose underlying assets consist primarily of marketable securities (the  affiliated entities ). We also have investments in unaffiliated entities of $14.8 million, $15.8 million and $13.8 million at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively (the  unaffiliated entities ).  On a quarterly basis, we evaluate each entity for the appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting update amending the consolidation requirements under GAAP.  This guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016.  Based on the new consolidation guidance, we have determined that two of the affiliated entities, and none of the unaffiliated entities, are required to be consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

For those entities where consolidation is not deemed to be appropriate, we report them in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition under the caption  Investments in partnerships .  This caption includes those investments, in both affiliated and unaffiliated entities, which the Company accounts for under the equity method of accounting, as well as certain investments that the feeder funds hold that are carried at fair value, as described in Note C.  The Company reflects the equity in earnings of these equity method investees and the change in fair value of the consolidated feeder funds ( CFFs ) under the caption Net gain/(loss) from investments on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

The following table highlights the number of entities, including voting interest entities ( VOEs ), that we consolidate as well as under which accounting guidance they are consolidated, including CFFs, which retain their specialized investment company accounting in consolidation, partnerships and offshore funds:

At and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one CFF VOE is consolidated, as the Company owns a majority of the interests in the CFF.  At and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one Partnership VIE is consolidated, as it is a VIE because the unaffiliated partners or shareholders lack substantive kick-out rights and the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary because it has an equity interest and absorbs the majority of the expected losses and/or expected gains.

The following table includes the net impact by line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income for each category of entity consolidated (in thousands):

Variable Interest Entities

We sponsor a number of investment vehicles where we are the general partner or investment manager. At September 30, 2016 we consolidated the only VIE.  At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, certain vehicles were deemed VIEs prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, but we were not the primary beneficiary, because we do not absorb a majority of the entities  expected losses and/or expected returns, and they were, therefore, not consolidated.  We consolidated VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary.  The Company has not provided any financial or other support to those VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary.

The total net assets of these non-consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 were $70.2 million and $65.8 million, respectively.  On December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the non-consolidated VIEs is limited to the investment in two VIEs of $9.9 million and $9.6 million, respectively, and the deferred carried interest that we have in another of $39,000 and $38,000, respectively, which was included in investments in partnerships on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.   Additionally, as the general partner or investment manager to the VIEs the Company earns fees in relation to this role, which given a decline in AUMs of the VIEs would result in lower fee revenues earned by the Company which would be reflected on the condensed consolidated statements of income, condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

23 

The assets of the VIEs may only be used to satisfy obligations of the VIEs.  The following table presents the balances related to the VIE that is consolidated and is included on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as well as AC Group s net interest in the VIE.  There is one VIE consolidated at  September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015:

E.     Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate ("ETR") for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 31.0% and 35.4%, respectively.  The ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 28.8% and 39.7%, respectively.  The differences in ETR primarily reflect the benefit of the dividends received deduction relative to the respective period s net income/(loss).

F.     Stockholders  Equity 

Shares outstanding were 25.4 million, 25.4 million and 25.5 million on September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively.

Voting Rights

The holders of Class A Common stock ( Class A Stock ) and Class B Common stock ( Class B Stock ) have identical rights except that (i) holders of Class A Stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by shareholders in general, and (ii) holders of Class A Stock are not eligible to vote on matters relating exclusively to Class B Stock and vice versa.

Stock Award and Incentive Plan

The Company maintains one Plan approved by the shareholders, which is designed to provide incentives which will attract and retain individuals key to the success of AC through direct or indirect ownership of our common stock.  Benefits under the Plan may be granted in any one or a combination of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock awards, dividend equivalents and other stock or cash based awards.  A maximum of 2.0 million shares of Class A Stock have been reserved for issuance as approved by the Company's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 3, 2016. Under the Plan, the committee may grant RSAs and either incentive or nonqualified stock options with a term not to exceed ten years from the grant date and at an exercise price that the committee may determine.

24 

On November 30, 2015, in connection with the spin-off of the Company from GAMCO on a one for one basis, the Company issued 554,100 AC RSA shares to employees who held 554,100 GAMCO RSA shares.  As of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, there were 427,290 RSA shares, 553,100 RSA shares and 688,550 RSA shares outstanding, respectively, that were previously issued at an average weighted GAMCO grant price of $65.72, $64.02 and $67.34, respectively.  These RSA grants occurred prior to the spin-off of Associated Capital.  On November 30, 2015, pursuant to the spin-off, all RSA grant holders received shares of Associated Capital s Class A common stock as a result of their ownership of their GAMCO unvested RSAs (one share of Associated Capital for each share of GBL).  All grants of the RSA shares were recommended by the Company's Chairman, who did not receive any RSAs, and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee").  This expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is either (1) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 70% over five years from the date of grant or (2) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 10% each year over years four through ten from the date of grant.  During the vesting period, dividends to RSA holders are held for them until the RSA vesting dates and are forfeited if the grantee is no longer employed by the Company on the vesting dates.  Dividends declared on these RSAs, less estimated forfeitures, are charged to retained earnings on the declaration date.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.  Actual and projected stock-based compensation expense for RSA shares for the years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2024 (based on awards currently issued or granted) is as follows (in thousands):

The total compensation cost related to non-vested RSAs not yet recognized is approximately $5.2 million as of September 30, 2016.

G.     Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 

At September 30, 2016, $3.4 million of goodwill is reflected within other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition with $3.4 million related to Gabelli Securities, Inc.  The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill at least annually, or more often should events warrant, using a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred to determine if a quantitative analysis is required.  There were no indicators of impairment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015, and as such there was no impairment analysis performed or charge recorded.

H.     Commitments and Contingencies 

From time to time, the Company may be named in legal actions and proceedings.  These actions may seek substantial or indeterminate compensatory as well as punitive damages or injunctive relief.  The Company is also subject to governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations.  The examinations or investigations could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief.  For any such matters, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the necessary provisions for losses that the Company believes are probable and estimable.  Furthermore, the Company evaluates whether there exist losses which may be reasonably possible and will, if material, make the necessary disclosures.  However, management believes such amounts, both those that are probable and those that are reasonably possible, are not material to the Company s financial condition, operations or cash flows at September 30, 2016.

The Company indemnifies the clearing brokers of G.research, LLC, our broker-dealer subsidiary, for losses they may sustain from the customer accounts that trade on margin introduced by it.  At September 30, 2016, the total amount of customer balances subject to indemnification (i.e. unsecured margin debits) was immaterial.  The Company also has entered into arrangements with various other third parties many of which provide for indemnification of the third parties against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of obligations under the agreements.  The Company has had no claims or payments pursuant to these or prior agreements and believes the likelihood of a claim being made is remote.  The Company s estimate of the value of such agreements is de minimis, and therefore an accrual has not been made on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

25 

I. Contractual Obligations

In June 2016, AC entered into a sublease agreement with GAMCO effective from April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017. Future minimum lease commitment under this operating lease as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:

J.     Subsequent Events 

From October 1, 2016 to November 4, 2016, the Company repurchased 28,718 shares at $33.93 per share.  As a result, there are 234,027 shares available to be repurchased under this existing buyback plan at November 4, 2016.

On November 4, 2016 AC announced that it had adopted a Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution program for all registered Class A and Class B shareholders at a rate of 25 cents per share. Based on the approximately 20 million shares currently registered in shareholders' names, the total contribution AC is expected to make will be $5.0 million. If all shares outstanding are registered in their shareholders' name at the record date, the total contribution would increase to $6.3 million.

On November 4, 2016, the Board of Directors of Associated Capital Group approved a name change for its wholly owned subsidiary, Gabelli Securities, Inc. to Gabelli   Company Investment Advisers, Inc.  This change will become effective upon GSI filing an amended and restated certificate of incorporation reflecting the new name in the State of Delaware.

ITEM 2:    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (INCLUDING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK) 

Introduction

MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's unaudited Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Company's audited annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016 to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to  we,   us,   our,   AC Group  or the  Company  refer collectively to Associated Capital Group, Inc., a holding company, and its subsidiaries through which our operations are actually conducted.

Factors Affecting Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Company's interim condensed combined consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2015, and the Company's interim condensed combined consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of GAMCO Investors, Inc. ( GAMCO ) and are presented as carve-out financial statements as the Company was not a standalone public company prior to the spin-off.  For the periods prior to the spin-off of the Company from GAMCO, the combined consolidated financial statements include allocations from GAMCO.  The consolidated statement of income for the periods ended September 30, 2015 includes allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by GAMCO and not historically recorded at the business unit level, such as expenses related to finance, human resources, information technology, and facilities, among others. These expenses were allocated on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro-rata basis of headcount or other measures. Management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the consolidated financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and may not reflect its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a separate, standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.

The Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are presented based on our actual results as a stand-alone public company subsequent to our spin-off.  References within these Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the condensed combined consolidated statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2015 shall hereinafter be referred to as the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  References within these Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the condensed combined consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 shall hereinafter be referred to as the condensed consolidated statements of income.

Overview

We are a Delaware corporation organized to be the parent operating company for the spin-off of GAMCO Investors, Inc. s ( GAMCO s ) alternative investment management business, institutional research services operations and certain cash and other assets.

On November 30, 2015, GAMCO distributed all the outstanding shares of each class of common stock of AC Group on a pro rata one-for-one basis to the holders of each class of GAMCO s common stock.  Prior to the distribution, GAMCO contributed the 93.9% interest it held in Gabelli Securities, Inc. ( GSI ) and certain cash and other assets to AC Group. GSI is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. GSI and its wholly owned subsidiary, Gabelli   Partners, LLC ("Gabelli   Partners"), collectively serve as general partners or investment managers to investment funds including limited partnerships and offshore companies (collectively, "Investment Partnerships"), and separate accounts. We primarily manage assets in equity event-driven value strategies, across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios. The business earns fees from its advisory assets, and income (loss) from trading and investment portfolio activities. The advisory fees include management and incentive fees. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of the portfolios' levels of assets under management. Incentive fees are based on the percentage of profits derived from the investment performance delivered to clients' invested assets.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AC purchased the 6.1% of GSI shares owned by third parties in exchange for 163,428 shares of the Company.  GSI is now a wholly owned subsidiary of AC. This transaction represents another important step in building a foundation for future growth of the business.  

27 

We operate our institutional research services operations through G.research, LLC ("G.research"), a wholly owned subsidiary of GSI. G.research is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Through G.research, we provide institutional research services as well as act as an underwriter. G.research is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). G.research's revenues are derived primarily from institutional research services.

In addition, the following transactions were also undertaken in connection with the spin-off:

GAMCO issued a promissory note (the "GAMCO Note") to AC Group in the original principal amount of $250.0 million used to partially capitalize the Company in connection with the spin-off. The GAMCO Note bears interest at 4.0% per annum and has a maturity date of November 30, 2020 with respect to the original principal amount of the GAMCO Note. Interest on the GAMCO Note will accrue from the most recent date for which interest has been paid, or if no interest has been paid, from the effective date of the GAMCO Note; provided, however, that at the election of GAMCO, payment of interest on the GAMCO Note may, in lieu of being paid in cash, be paid, in whole or in part, in kind on the then-outstanding principal amount (a "PIK Amount"). GAMCO will repay all PIK Amounts added to the outstanding principal amount of the GAMCO Note, in cash, on the fifth anniversary of the date on which each such PIK Amount was added to the outstanding principal amount of the GAMCO Note.  In no event may any interest be paid in kind subsequent to November 30, 2019.  GAMCO may prepay the GAMCO Note prior to maturity without penalty.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, AC received principal repayments totaling $150 million on the GAMCO Note.  $50 million of the prepayment was applied against the principal amount due on November 30, 2016, $40 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2017, $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2018, and $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2019.  Of the $100 million principal amount outstanding, $10 million is due on November 30, 2017, $20 million is due on November 30, 2018, $20 million is due on November 30, 2019, and $50 million is due on November 30, 2020. 

As part of the spin-off from GAMCO, on November 27, 2015 GSI purchased from GAMCO 4,393,055 shares of GAMCO class A common stock at a price of $34.1448 per share, based on the average of the volume weighted average price for GAMCO class A stock on an    ex-Distribution    basis from November 9, 2015 through and including November 27, 2015.  GSI paid for the purchase by issuing a note to GAMCO in the principal amount of $150.0 million (the    GSI Note   ).  The GSI Note was then contributed by GAMCO to AC and GSI became a majority-owned subsidiary of AC on November 30, 2015 in connection with the completion of the spin-off.  As of June 30, 2016, GSI is a wholly owned subsidiary of AC.  

Organizational Chart

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income

Investment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our funds and accounts, represent our largest source of revenues.   Growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels.  Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service.

28 

Incentive fees generally consist of an incentive allocation on the absolute gain in a portfolio or a fee of 20% of the economic profit, as defined in the agreements governing the investment vehicle.  We recognize revenue only when the measurement period has been completed and when the incentive fees have been earned.

Institutional research services revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis or direct payments on behalf of institutional clients.  Commission revenues vary directly with the perceived value of the research, as well as account trading activity and new account generation.

Compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff.  Variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents 40% of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs.

Management fee is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli or his designee for acting as CEO pursuant to his Employment Agreement so long as he is an executive of AC.

Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs and clearing charges and fees incurred by the brokerage business.

Other income and expenses include net gains from investments (which include both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities and equity in earnings of investments in partnerships), interest and dividend income, and interest expense.  Net gains from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments.

Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests represents the share of net income (loss) attributable to the minority stockholders, as reported on a separate company basis, of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiary and net income (loss) attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and investors of offshore funds we consolidate.  Please refer to Notes A and D in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition

At September 30, 2016, the Company s book value on a GAAP basis was $898 million, or $35.41 per share, including cash and investments of $884 million. This includes $427 million of cash and short term US treasuries; $203 million of marketable securities, including 4.4 million shares of GAMCO stock; and $254 million invested in affiliated and third party funds and partnerships. The Company has no long term debt.  Our financial resources underpin our flexibility to pursue strategic objectives that may include acquisitions, lift-outs, seeding new investment strategies, and co-investing, as well as shareholder compensation in the form of share repurchase and dividends.

Total shareholders  equity was $898 million or $35.41 per share at September 30, 2016 compared to $752 million or $29.54 per share on December 31, 2015.  The increase in equity from the end of 2015 was due primarily to the receipt of principal prepayments on the GAMCO Note totaling $150.0 million, our net income of $6.5 million and the exchange of AC shares for GSI shares from the minority investors in GSI of $1.6 million, offset by $6.9 million spent on stock repurchases, the decrease in the value of our available for sale portfolio, net of taxes, of $4.8 million, and dividends declared and paid of $2.5 million.

Adjusted Economic book value   a Non-GAAP measure

Adjusted Economic book value ( AEBV ) and Adjusted Economic book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful for analyzing the Company s financial condition during the period in which it builds its core operating businesses.  For GAAP purposes, the amount of the GAMCO Note, which was issued to the Company as part of the spin-off transaction, is treated as a reduction in equity for the period all or a portion of it is outstanding.  As GAMCO pays down the GAMCO Note, the Company's total equity will increase, and once the GAMCO Note is fully paid off by GAMCO, the Company's total equity and AEBV will be the same. AEBV and AEBV per share represent book value and book value per share, respectively, without reducing equity for the period all or any portion of the GAMCO Note is outstanding.

29 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, AC received principal repayments totaling $150 million on the GAMCO Note.  $50 million of the prepayment was applied against the principal amount due on November 30, 2016, $40 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2017, $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2018, and $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2019.  Of the $100 million principal amount outstanding, $10 million is due on November 30, 2017, $20 million is due on November 30, 2018, $20 million is due on November 30, 2019, and $50 million is due on November 30, 2020. 

At September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, AEBV for the Company was $998.1 billion, $1.005 billion and $1.002 billion, respectively, and the AEBV per diluted share was $39.35, $39.48 and $39.37, respectively, calculated as follows:

Overview 

Net income/(loss) attributable to shareholders of AC Group for the quarter was $4.0 million, or $0.16 per fully diluted share, versus ($7.5) million, or ($0.30) per fully diluted share, in the prior year s quarter.  The quarter to quarter comparison was principally impacted by marking the proprietary portfolios to market.

Revenues 

Total revenues were $5.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, $0.8 million, or 17.0%, higher than total revenues of $4.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  

Investment advisory income is directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM.   We earn advisory fees based on the level of average AUM in our products.  Advisory fees, excluding incentive fees, were $2.3 million for the 2016 quarter compared to $2.2 million for the prior year quarter, an increase of $0.1 million.  This increase is due to the increase in AUM to $1.251 billion in the third quarter of 2016 from $1.085 billion in the third quarter of 2015.  Incentive fees are not recognized until the measurement period ends and the fee is crystalized (typically in the fourth quarter, based on results for the calendar year).  If the measurement period had instead ended on September 30, we would have recognized $2.6 million and $(2.9) million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Institutional research services revenues in the current year s third quarter was $2.6 million, 23.8% higher than the prior year s period of $2.1 million primarily due to higher underwriting fees earned for preferred stock offerings and sales manager fees from at-the market offerings of certain GAMCO closed-end funds, partially offset by a reduction of income earned from research provided to third party institutions.

Other revenue was $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Expenses 

Compensation costs, which include variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, were $6.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, versus $5.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Fixed compensation costs, which include salaries and benefits, increased to $3.5 million for the third quarter 2016 from $3.3 million in the 2015 period due to an increase in research analyst headcount and additional administrative personnel necessary to support our reporting as a stand-alone public company.  Discretionary bonus accruals increased in the third quarter of 2016 to $0.9 million from $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 due to relative outperformance of our funds and investment portfolios versus the comparable 2015 period.  The remainder of the compensation expense represents variable compensation that fluctuates with management fee and incentive allocation revenues and gains on investment portfolios.  Variable payouts as a percent of revenues are impacted by the mix of products upon which performance fees are earned and the extent to which they may exceed their allocated costs.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock based compensation was $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mario J. Gabelli pursuant to his employment agreement.  In the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, AC recorded management fee expense/(benefit) of $0.6 and ($1.4) million, respectively.

Other operating expenses were $2.2 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.4 million in prior year third quarter, an increase of $0.8 million due primarily to increased professional fees.

Other 

Net gain/(loss) from investments is directly related to the performance of our proprietary investment portfolio.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, net gain/(loss) from investments was $7.6 million, an increase from the prior year quarter s loss of ($11.5) million due to marking the proprietary portfolios to market.

Interest and dividend income increased $2.2 million to $2.8 million in the 2016 quarter from $0.6 million in the 2015 quarter due to interest earned on the GAMCO Note.  Interest expense decreased to $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $0.3 million in the prior year s period.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared To Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

Overview 

Net income/(loss) attributable to shareholders of AC Group for the first nine months of 2016 was $6.6 million, or $0.26 per fully diluted share, versus ($4.3) million, or ($0.17) per fully diluted share, in the prior year s first nine months.  The period to period comparison was principally impacted by marking the proprietary portfolios to market.

Revenues 

Total revenues were $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $1.1 million, or 8.0%, higher than total revenues of $13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Investment advisory income is directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM.   We earn advisory fees based on the level of average AUM in our products.  Advisory fees, excluding incentive fees, were $6.6 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $6.2 million for the prior year period, an increase of $0.4 million.  This increase is directly correlated to the increase in AUM to $1.251 billion at September 2016 from $1.085 billion at September 2015.  Incentive fees are not recognized until the measurement period ends and the fee is crystalized (typically in the fourth quarter, based on results for the calendar year).  If the measurement period had instead ended on September 30, we would have recognized $6.1 million and $0.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Institutional research services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $7.0 million versus $6.1 million in the prior year period due to higher underwriting fees earned for preferred stock offerings and sales manager fees from at-the market offerings of certain GAMCO closed-end funds.

Other revenue was $1.4 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Expenses 

Compensation costs, which include variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, were $18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a 9.6% increase from $16.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Fixed compensation costs, which include salaries and benefits, increased to $11.0 million in the 2016 period from $10.1 million in the 2015 period due to an increase in research analyst headcount and additional administrative personnel necessary to support our reporting as a stand-alone public company.  Discretionary bonus accruals increased in the first nine months of 2016 to $2.6 million from $1.9 million in the first nine months of 2015 due to relative outperformance of our funds and investment portfolios versus the comparable 2015 period.  The remainder of the compensation expenses represents variable compensation that fluctuates with management fee and incentive allocation revenues and gains on investment portfolios.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock based compensation was $2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.

Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mario J. Gabelli pursuant to his employment agreement.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, AC recorded management fee expense/(benefit) of $1.1 million and ($0.9) million, respectively.

Other operating expenses were $6.0 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to $4.7 million in prior year period, an increase of $1.3 million due primarily to increased professional fees.

Other 

Net gain/(loss) from investments is directly related to the performance of our proprietary investment portfolio.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net gain/(loss) from investments was $12.8 million, an increase from the prior year period s loss of ($0.8) million due to due to marking the proprietary portfolios to market.

Interest and dividend income increased $7.5 million to $9.8 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $2.3 million in the 2015 period due to interest earned on the GAMCO Note.  Interest expense decreased to $0.6 million in the 2016 period as compared to $1.0 million in 2015.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

Our revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management and fees associated with our various investment products, rather than our own corporate assets.  Assets under management, which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets, can also fluctuate through acquisitions, the creation of new products, the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts.  Since various equity products have different fees, changes in our business mix may also affect revenues.  At times, the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices, and this can also impact our revenues.  

Assets under management ( AUM ) were $1.251 billion as of September 30, 2016, an increase of 5.0% from AUM of $1.191 billion at June 30, 2016 and increased 15.3% from the September 30, 2015 AUM of $1.085 billion.  The increases were attributable both to market appreciation and increased investments, net of redemptions, by investors.

Table II: Fund Flows - Year to date September 30, 2016 

Table III: Assets Under Management by Quarter

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal assets are highly liquid in nature and consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, securities held for investment purposes, investments in funds, and investment partnerships.  Cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of U.S. Treasury money market funds.  Although investments in partnerships and offshore funds are subject to restrictions as to the timing of distributions, the underlying investments of such partnerships or funds are, for the most part, liquid, and the valuations of these products reflect that underlying liquidity.

Summary cash flow data is as follows:

We require relatively low levels of capital expenditures and have a highly variable cost structure where costs increase and decrease based on the level of revenues we receive. Our revenues, in turn, are highly correlated to the level of AUM and to their investment performance. We anticipate that our available liquid assets should be more than sufficient to meet our cash requirements as we build out our operating businesses.  At September 30, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $402.4 million and $481.7 million in investments.  Cash and cash equivalents of $0.008 million and investments in securities of $8.1 million held by a consolidated investment partnership may not be readily available for the Company to access.

34 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $58.8 million. In the first nine months of 2016, our sources of cash included a $62.1 million decrease in receivable from brokers, $53.6 million of decreases in investments in trading securities, a rise in net income of $11.6 million, $4.6 million increase for income taxes payables and deferred tax liabilities, increased accrued expenses and other liabilities of $4.0 million, and $1.7 million from an increase in compensation payable.  Cash uses included a $92.3 million decrease in payables to brokers, a $19.9 million increase in other assets, $15.0 million of contributions to partnerships, $8.5 million of decreases in distributions from partnerships, $6.5 million of equity in net gains from partnerships, and a $2.3 million decline in payable to affiliates.  Cash used in investing activities, related to purchases, proceeds from sales, and return of capital of available for sale securities, was $2.6 million in the first nine months of 2016.  Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2016 was $140.4 million primarily due to $150.0 million of proceeds from payment of GBL 4% PIK Note.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $65.1 million.  Cash used in investing activities, related to purchases, proceeds from sales, and return of capital of available for sale securities, was $41.5 million in the first nine months of 2015.  Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2015 was $53.9 million.

G.research is subject to certain net capital requirements.   G.research computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted, which requires minimum net capital of the greater of $250,000 or 2% of the aggregate debit items in the reserve formula for those broker-dealers subject to Rule 15c3-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The requirement was $250,000 for the broker-dealer at September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, G.research had net capital, as defined, of approximately $2.8 million, exceeding the regulatory requirement by approximately $2.5 million.  Net capital requirements for our affiliated broker-dealer may increase in accordance with rules and regulations to the extent it engages in other business activities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  See Note A and the Company s Critical Accounting Policies in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in AC s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016 for details on Critical Accounting Policies.

Item 3. 
 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a smaller reporting company, this information is not required to be provided.

Item 4. 
 
 Controls and Procedures

We evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  Disclosure controls and procedures as defined under the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and regulations.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our CEO and CFO participated in this evaluation and concluded that, as of the date of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

35 

Forward-Looking Information

Our disclosure and analysis in this report contain some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,  and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results.  Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations or beliefs include, without limitation:

the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets

a decline in the performance of our products

a general downturn in the economy

changes in government policy or regulation

changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees

unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations

We also direct your attention to any more specific discussions of risk contained in our Form 10-Q and other public filings.  We are providing these statements as permitted by the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations or if we receive any additional information relating to the subject matters of our forward-looking statements.

Part II:  Other Information

Item 1. 
 
 Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company may be named in legal actions and proceedings.  These actions may seek substantial or indeterminate compensatory as well as punitive damages or injunctive relief.  The Company is also subject to governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations.  The examinations or investigations could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief.  For any such matters, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the necessary provisions for losses that the Company believes are probable and estimable.  Furthermore, the Company evaluates whether there exist losses which may be reasonably possible and will, if material, make the necessary disclosures.  However, management believes such amounts, both those that would be probable and those that would be reasonably possible, are not material to the Company s financial condition, operations or cash flows at September 30, 2016.
