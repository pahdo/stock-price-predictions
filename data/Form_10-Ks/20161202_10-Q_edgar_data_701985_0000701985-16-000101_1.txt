1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
  Description of Business 
  L Brands, Inc. ( the Company ) operates in the highly competitive specialty retail business. The Company is a specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories. The Company sells its merchandise through company-owned specialty retail stores in the United States ( U.S. ), Canada, United Kingdom ("U.K.") and Greater China (China and Hong Kong), and through its websites and other channels. The Company's other international operations are primarily through franchise, license and wholesale partners. The Company currently operates the following retail brands: 
             
    Victoria s Secret 
                
    PINK 
                
    Bath   Body Works 
                
    La Senza 
                
    Henri Bendel 
     Fiscal Year 
  The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31.  As used herein,    third   quarter of   2016    and    third   quarter of   2015    refer to the   thirteen   week periods ending   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. "  Year-to-date 2016  " and "  year-to-date 2015  " refer to the   thirty-nine   week periods ending   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investee's net income or loss. Losses are only recognized to the extent the Company has positive carrying value related to the investee. Carrying values are only reduced below   zero   if the Company has an obligation to provide funding to the investee. The Company s share of net income or loss of unconsolidated entities from which the Company purchases merchandise or merchandise components is included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company s share of net income or loss of all other unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company s equity method investments are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined there may be an other-than-temporary loss in value. 
  Interim Financial Statements 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   are unaudited and are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. 
  Seasonality of Business 
  Due to seasonal variations in the retail industry, the results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk and Investments 
  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity.  Typically, the Company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.

     Table of Contents  

The Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.  The Company records an allowance for uncollectable accounts when it becomes probable that the counterparty will be unable to pay. 
  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. 

2. New Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2018, with early adoption as of fiscal year 2017 permitted.  The standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method.  The Company is currently evaluating this standard, including the transition method and timing of adoption, and the related impact on its Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  This guidance requires companies classified as lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today s accounting.  The new standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  The standard requires modified retrospective adoption and will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating this standard, including the timing of adoption, and the related impact on its Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.  
  Simplifying the Presentation of Share-Based Compensation 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This guidance requires companies to recognize income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.  The standard also will require all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows, and any cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employee's behalf as financing activities.  The standard will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted.  Management has determined that the Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the related impact on its Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   This guidance requires companies to recognize debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liabilities on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of those debt liabilities, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is effective beginning in fiscal year 2016, with early adoption permitted. 
  The Company elected to early adopt this standard effective January 30, 2016. Upon adoption, prior period financial statements were recast as required by the standard to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liabilities.  The impact of the adoption of this standard is a decrease of   $49 million   to Other Assets and Long-term Debt on the   October 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  
   7 

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.   This guidance requires companies to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet.  This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2017, and early adoption is permitted.  
  The Company elected to early adopt this standard effective January 30, 2016 using the retrospective application transition method.  Upon adoption, prior period financial statements were recast to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet.  The impact of the adoption of this standard on the   October 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheet is a decrease in current deferred income tax assets of   $35 million  ; an increase in noncurrent deferred income tax assets of   $8 million  ; and a decrease to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of   $27 million  . 

3. Earnings Per Share and Shareholders  Equity (Deficit) 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Earnings per basic share is computed based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares. Earnings per diluted share include the weighted-average effect of dilutive options and restricted stock on the weighted-average shares outstanding. 
  The following table provides shares utilized for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the   third   quarter and year-to-date   2016   and   2015  : 

_______________ 
           (a) 
    These options and awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
       
  Shareholders  Equity (Deficit) 
  Common Stock Share Repurchases 
  Under the authority of the Company s Board of Directors, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under the following repurchase programs for year-to-date   2016   and   2015  : 

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new   $500 million   share repurchase program, which included   $17 million   remaining under the June 2015 repurchase program. 
  The February 2016 repurchase program had   $90 million   remaining as of   October 29, 2016  . Subsequent to   October 29, 2016  , the Company repurchased an additional   0.2 million   shares of common stock for   $11 million   under this program. 
  There were   no   share repurchases reflected in Accounts Payable on the   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Dividends 
  Under the authority and declaration of the Board of Directors, the Company paid the following dividends during year-to-date   2016   and   2015  : 

4. Acquisition 
  On   April 18, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of American Beauty Limited for a total purchase price of   $44 million  .  This agreement included the reacquisition of the franchise rights from one of our partners to operate Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in Greater China, including   26   stores already open at the time of acquisition. The purchase price included   $10 million   in forgiveness of liabilities owed to the Company from the pre-existing relationship.  As a result of this acquisition, the Company's financial statements now include the financial results of American Beauty Limited, which are reported as part of the Victoria's Secret and Bath   Body Works International segment. 
  The total purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value.  Such estimated fair values require management to make estimates and judgments, especially with respect to intangible assets.  The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was complete as of the second quarter of 2016.  Goodwill related to the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:

5. Restructuring Activities 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced strategic actions within the Victoria s Secret segment designed to focus the brand on its core merchandise categories and streamline operations. The Company announced it will place more focus on brand building and loyalty-enhancing marketing and advertising rather than using traditional catalogues and offers.  As a result of these actions, the Company recorded charges related to cancellations of fabric commitments for non-go forward merchandise and a reserve against paper that was previously intended for future catalogues.  These costs, totaling   $11 million  , including non-cash charges of   $10 million  , are included in Cost of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the year-to-date 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income.  These actions also resulted in the elimination of approximately   200   positions primarily in the Company's Ohio and New York home offices.  Severance and related costs associated with these eliminations, totaling   $24 million  , are included in General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the year-to-date 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income.  The Company recognized a total pre-tax charge of   $35 million   for these items in the first quarter of   2016  .  Through the   third   quarter of 2016, the Company made cash payments of   $13 million   and decreased the estimate of expected severance and related costs by   $2 million  .  The remaining balance of   $10 million   is included in Accrued Expenses and Other on the   October 29, 2016   Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

6. Inventories 
  The following table provides details of inventories as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the weighted-average cost method, or market. 

7. Property and Equipment, Net 
  The following table provides details of property and equipment, net as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

Depreciation expense was   $133 million   and   $111 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Depreciation expense was   $378 million   and   $335 million   for year-to-date   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  

8. Equity Investments and Other 
  Third-party Apparel Sourcing Business 
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company divested its remaining ownership interest in its third-party apparel sourcing business. The Company received cash proceeds of   $85 million   and recognized a pre-tax gain of   $78 million   (after-tax gain of   $69 million  ).  The gain is included in Other Income in the year-to-date   2015   Consolidated Statement of Income and the cash proceeds are included in Proceeds from Divestiture of Third-party Apparel Sourcing Business within the Investing Activities section of the   2015   Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
  Easton Investments 
  The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a   1,300  -acre planned community in Columbus, Ohio, that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational space. These investments totaled   $80 million   as of   October 29, 2016  ,   $86 million   as of   January 30, 2016   and   $96 million   as of   October 31, 2015   and are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

     Table of Contents  

Included in the Company s Easton investments is an equity interest in Easton Town Center, LLC ( ETC ), an entity that owns and has developed a commercial entertainment and shopping center. The Company s investment in ETC is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company has a majority financial interest in ETC, but another unaffiliated member manages ETC. Certain significant decisions regarding ETC require the consent of unaffiliated members in addition to the Company. 
  In the second quarter of 2016, ETC refinanced its bank loan.  In conjunction with the loan refinancing, the Company received a cash distribution from ETC of   $124 million   and recognized a pre-tax gain of   $108 million   (after-tax gain of   $70 million  ). The gain is included in Other Income in the year-to-date 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income and the return of capital is included within the Investing Activities section of the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
  Also included in the Company's Easton investments is an equity interest in Easton Gateway, LLC ("EG"), an entity that owns and has developed a commercial shopping center in the Easton community.  The Company's investment in EG is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company has a majority financial interest in EG, but another unaffiliated member manages EG.  Certain significant decisions regarding EG require the consent of the unaffiliated member in addition to the Company.  

9. Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of the annual effective tax rate and is adjusted as necessary for quarterly events. The Company s quarterly effective tax rate does not reflect a benefit associated with losses related to certain foreign subsidiaries. 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company s effective tax rate was   36.0%   compared to   36.8%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The   third   quarter   2016   rate was lower than the Company's combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters.  The   third   quarter   2015   rate was lower than the Company s combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a rate lower than our combined federal and state rate.  
  For year-to-date   2016  , the Company s effective tax rate was   34.5%   compared to   35.2%   year-to-date   2015  .  The year-to-date   2016   rate was lower than the Company's combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters.  The year-to-date   2015   rate was lower than the Company s combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the foreign portion of the divestiture of our third-party apparel sourcing business.  
  As of   October 29, 2016  , any unrecognized deferred income tax liability resulting from the Company's undistributed foreign earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future; furthermore, the undistributed foreign earnings are permanently reinvested.  If the Company elects to distribute these foreign earnings in the future, they could be subject to additional income taxes.  Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. 
  Income taxes paid were approximately   $103 million   and   $106 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Income taxes paid were approximately   $441 million   and   $476 million   for year-to-date   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Uncertain Tax Positions    
  The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of   $248 million   as of   January 30, 2016  , of which approximately   $217 million  , if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. For year-to-date 2016, the Company had a net decrease to gross unrecognized tax benefits of   $94 million  , primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters, resulting in a   $16 million   benefit to the Company's Provision for Income Taxes. 
  Of the total unrecognized benefits as of   October 29, 2016  , it is reasonably possible that   $78 million   could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements, expiration of statute of limitations or other resolution of uncertainties.  Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in amounts which could be different from this estimate.  In such case, the Company will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such matters are effectively settled.   
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense.  As of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Company had accrued   $26 million  ,   $38 million  , and   $33 million  , respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties.

10. Long-term Debt 
  The following table provides the Company s debt balance, net of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts, as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  :   

     ________________ 
      
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The impact of the adoption of this standard is a decrease to Other Assets and Long-term Debt on the   October 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheet of   $49 million  . For additional information, see Note   2  , "New Accounting Pronouncements." 
  Issuance of Notes 
  In June 2016, the Company issued   $700 million   of   6.75%   notes due in July 2036.  The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of the Company's 100% owned subsidiaries (the "Guarantors").  The proceeds from the issuance were   $692 million  , which were net of issuance costs of   $8 million  . These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of July 2036 and are included within Long-term Debt on the   October 29, 2016   Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  In October 2015, the Company issued   $1 billion   of   6.875%   notes due in November 2035.  The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors.  The proceeds from the issuance were   $988 million  , which were net of issuance costs of   $12 million  .  These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of November 2035 and are included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Repurchase of Notes 
  In July 2016, the Company used the proceeds from the 2036 Notes to repurchase the   $700 million   2017 Notes for   $742 million  .  The pre-tax loss on extinguishment of this debt was   $36 million   (after-tax net loss of   $22 million  ), which is net of gains of   $7 million   related to terminated interest rate swaps associated with the 2017 Notes.  This loss is included in Other Income in the year-to-date 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income.

Revolving Facilities 
  The Company maintains a secured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Facility ). The Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of   $1 billion   and expires July 18, 2019. The fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are   0.30%   per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are   1.50%   per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings or British pound borrowings is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus   1.50%   per annum. The interest rate on outstanding Canadian dollar borrowings is Canadian Dollar Offered Rate ("CDOR") plus   1.50%   per annum. 
  The Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. The Company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than   1.75   to   1.00   and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding   4.00   to   1.00   for the most recent four-quarter period.  In addition, the Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than   3.00   to   1.00   and (b) no default or event of default exists.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with both of its financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than   3.00   to   1.00  . 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. 
  The Revolving Facility supports the Company s letter of credit program. The Company had   $8 million   of outstanding letters of credit as of   October 29, 2016   that reduce its remaining availability under the Revolving Facility. 
  In addition to the Revolving Facility, the Company maintains various revolving and term loan bank facilities with availability totaling   $100 million   to support its foreign operations ("Foreign Facilities"). Current borrowings on these Foreign Facilities mature between November 15, 2016 and October 26, 2017. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. 
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company borrowed   $10 million   and made payments of   $4 million   under the Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time during   2016   was   $23 million  . As of   October 29, 2016  , there were borrowings of   $23 million   outstanding under the Foreign Facilities. 
  Interest Rate Swap Arrangements 
  For information related to the Company s fair value interest rate swap arrangements, see Note   11  ,  Derivative Financial Instruments.  

11. Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.  All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. 
  For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings.  Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness, if any, are recognized in current earnings. 
  For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument has an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the liability on the balance sheet. 
  For derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
  The Company's Canadian dollar and British pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of its merchandise sold in Canada and the U.K. is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions.  As a result, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign currency exposure associated with forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated merchandise purchases.  These forward contracts currently have a maximum term of   18   months.  Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer.  These gains and losses are recognized in Cost of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  
    
  The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedges to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized merchandise payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies.  The fair value of these non-designated foreign currency forward contracts is not significant as of   October 29, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

The Company has a cross-currency swap related to an intercompany loan of approximately CAD  $170 million   maturing in January 2018 which is designated as a cash flow hedge of foreign currency exchange risk.  This cross-currency swap mitigates the exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate related to the Company's Canadian operations.  The cross-currency swap requires the periodic exchange of fixed-rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed-rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar principal payments upon maturity.  Changes in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate and the related swap settlements result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings to completely offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses recognized on the intercompany loan.  
    
  The following table provides the U.S. dollar notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  :

________________ 
           (a) 
    Represents reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings when the hedged merchandise is sold to the customer.   No   ineffectiveness was associated with these foreign currency cash flow hedges. 
              (b) 
    Represents reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings to completely offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses recognized on the intercompany loan.   No   ineffectiveness was associated with this foreign currency cash flow hedge. 
       
  We estimate that   $4 million   of foreign currency cash flow hedge gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of   October 29, 2016   will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months.  Actual amounts ultimately reclassified depend on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature.   
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company has interest rate swap arrangements related to   $300 million   of the outstanding 2019 Notes that are designated as interest rate fair value hedges.  The interest rate swap arrangements effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the related debt to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed percentage.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps have an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet.  The differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap arrangements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.

The following table provides a summary of the fair value and balance sheet classification of the derivative financial instruments designated as interest rate fair value hedges as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

12. Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of long-term debt as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

_______________ 
           (a) 
    The estimated fair value of the Company s publicly traded debt is based on reported transaction prices which are considered Level 2 inputs in accordance with ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement  .  The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. 
     The authoritative guidance included in ASC Topic   820   establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: 
             
    Level   1     Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level   2     Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices of similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level   3     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 
     
   15 

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides a summary of assets and liabilities measured in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

The Company's Level   1   fair value measurements use unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company invested   $50 million   in U.S. Treasury Bills which were classified as available-for-sale. These securities were sold in the third quarter of 2015.   In the third quarter of 2015, the Company invested   $10 million   in marketable equity securities which were classified as available-for-sale.  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold a portion of this investment and received cash proceeds of   $10 million   and recognized a pre-tax gain of   $4 million   (after-tax gain of   $3 million  ). The gain is included within Other Income in the year-to-date 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income, and the cash proceeds are included in Proceeds from Sale of Marketable Securities within the Investing Activities section of the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These securities are classified as Level 1 fair value measurements as they are traded with sufficient frequency and volume to enable the Company to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.   
  The Company s Level   2   fair value measurements use market approach valuation techniques. The primary inputs to these techniques include benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable to the underlying instruments. 
  Management believes that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity.

14. Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Actions filed against the Company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Guarantees 
  In connection with the disposition of certain businesses, the Company has remaining guarantees of approximately   $18 million   related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancellable leases expiring at various dates through 2021. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, the Company s guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended.  The Company has not recorded a liability with respect to these guarantee obligations as it concluded that payments under these guarantees were not probable as of   October 29, 2016  . 
  In connection with the sale and leaseback under noncancellable operating leases of certain assets, the Company provides residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term.  The leases expire in 2020, and the total amount of the guarantees is approximately   $105 million  .  The Company recorded a liability of   $3 million   related to these guarantee obligations as of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , which is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

15. Retirement Benefits 
  The Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for substantially all of its associates within the U.S. Participation in the tax-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age and service requirements. Participation in the non-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age, service, job level and compensation requirements. 
  The qualified plan permits participating associates to elect contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates  eligible annual compensation and years of service. Associate contributions and Company matching contributions vest immediately. Additional Company contributions and the related investment earnings are subject to vesting based on years of service. Total expense recognized related to the qualified plan was   $15 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  . Total expense recognized related to the qualified plan was   $47 million   for year-to-date   2016   and   $46 million   for year-to-date   2015  . 
  The non-qualified plan is an unfunded plan which provides benefits beyond the Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits participating associates to elect contributions up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates  eligible compensation and years of service. The plan also permits participating associates to defer additional compensation up to a maximum amount which the Company does not match. Associates  accounts are credited with interest using a fixed rate determined by the Company and reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, prior to the beginning of each year. Associate contributions and the related interest vest immediately.  Company contributions, along with related interest, are subject to vesting based on years of service. Associates may elect in-service distributions for the unmatched additional deferred compensation component only. The remaining vested portion of associates  accounts in the plan will be distributed upon termination of employment in either a lump sum or in annual installments over a specified period of up to   10   years. Total expense recognized related to the non-qualified plan was   $7 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Total expense recognized related to the non-qualified plan was   $20 million   for year-to-date   2016   and   $22 million   for year-to-date   2015  .

Review Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders  
  of L Brands, Inc.:  
    
  We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of L Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine   week periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , and cash flows for the   thirty-nine   week periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of L Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of    January 30, 2016  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, total equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein) and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated March 18, 2016. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of L Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of   January 30, 2016  ,  is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Item 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
       
  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1. Financial Statements. 
  Executive Overview  
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , our operating income decreased   $55 million  , or   16%  , to   $284 million  , and our operating income rate decreased to   11.0%   from   13.7%  .  Net sales increased   $99 million   to   $2.581 billion  , comparable sales increased   2%  , and comparable store sales were flat.  At Victoria's Secret, net sales increased   1%  , and operating income decreased   22%  .  At Bath   Body Works, net sales increased   9%  , and operating income increased   7%  .  At Victoria's Secret and Bath   Body Works International, net sales increased   12%  , and operating income decreased   51%  .  For additional information related to our   third   quarter   2016   financial performance, see  Results of Operations.    
  The global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we continue to manage our business carefully and focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals.   
  At the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments and store and digital experiences to our customers. We will look for, and capitalize on, those opportunities available to us. We believe that our brands, which lead their categories and offer high emotional content to customers at accessible prices, are well-positioned.

Adjusted Financial Information 
  In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-Q, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present net income and earnings per share in   2016   and   2015   on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature.  We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally.  These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.  Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.  The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.

_______________ 
           (a) 
    In the first quarter of 2016, we announced strategic actions within the Victoria s Secret segment designed to focus the brand on its core merchandise categories and streamline operations.

For additional information see Note 5, "Restructuring Activities" included in Item 1. Financial Statements.  
              (b) 
    In the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased our   $700 million     6.90%   Senior Unsecured Notes due July 2017 resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of   $36 million   (after-tax loss of   $22 million  ).  For additional information see Note 10, "Long-term Debt" included in Item 1. Financial Statements.

For additional information see Note 8, "Equity Investments and Other" included in Item 1. Financial Statements.  
              (d) 
    In the first quarter of 2015, we divested our remaining ownership interest in our third-party apparel sourcing business.

________ 
           (a) 
    The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels.  A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable store sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. Comparable store sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 
              (b) 
    Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
     The results by segment are as follows: 
  Victoria's Secret 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , net sales increased   $17 million   to   $1.584 billion  , comparable sales decreased   1%   and comparable store sales decreased   2%  .  Net sales increased primarily due to increases in PINK and sport, driven by a compelling merchandise assortment that incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.  These results were partially offset by decreases in swim and apparel due to a strategic decision to exit these categories, core bras due to lower average unit retail prices, and beauty as we reposition the category. 
  The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a decrease in total transactions. 
  Bath   Body Works 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , net sales increased   $65 million   to   $770 million  , comparable sales increased   7%   and comparable store sales increased   5%  .  Net sales increased across most categories including home fragrance, Signature Collection and soaps and sanitizers, which all incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. 
  The increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in total transactions.

     Table of Contents  

Victoria's Secret and Bath   Body Works International 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , net sales increased   $11 million   to   $104 million   primarily related to recently acquired Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in Greater China, company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in the U.K., and additional stores opened by our partners. These results were partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign currency at Victoria's Secret U.K. and Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories. 
  Other 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , net sales increased   $6 million   to   $123 million   primarily related to an increase in net sales at La Senza and international sourcing revenues. 
  Gross Profit  
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , our gross profit decreased   $6 million   to $  1.025 billion  , and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to   39.7%   from   41.6%  , primarily driven by the following: 
  Victoria's Secret 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the gross profit decrease was driven by a decline in merchandise margin primarily due to a decline in beauty as we reposition the category, promotions and pricing to drive trial in key categories and clearance activity on non-go forward merchandise categories.  Buying and occupancy expenses decreased primarily driven by the discontinuation of catalogue production, and were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to investments in store real estate.   
  The gross profit rate decrease was driven primarily by increases in the promotional and clearance activity described above, partially offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses due to decreased catalogue costs. 
  Bath   Body Works 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars primarily related to the increase in net sales. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to investments in store real estate. 
  The gross profit rate decrease was driven by an increase in occupancy expenses primarily due to investments in store real estate.  
  Victoria's Secret and Bath   Body Works International 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the gross profit decrease was driven by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater China and the negative impacts of foreign currency on merchandise margin at Victoria's Secret U.K.  These decreases were partially offset by increased merchandise margin dollars generated from higher net sales from recently acquired stores in Greater China. 
  The gross profit rate decrease was driven primarily by an increase in occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate and the negative impacts of foreign currency on merchandise margin at Victoria's Secret U.K. 
  General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses  
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased   $49 million   to $  741 million   primarily due to corporate expenses in Greater China, increased legal expenses and increased store selling expenses related to higher sales volumes. 
  The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to   28.7%   from   27.9%   due to corporate expenses in Greater China, increased legal expenses and increased selling expenses, partially offset by leverage from higher sales. 
  Other Income and Expense 
  Interest Expense 
  The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  : 

For the   third   quarter of   2016  , our interest expense increased   $18 million   to $  97 million   primarily due to an increase in average borrowings related to the October 2015 $1 billion note issuance.

  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , our other income increased   $3 million   to   $3 million   primarily driven by a gain on a distribution received from an investment. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , our effective tax rate was   36.0%   compared to   36.8%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The   third   quarter   2016   rate was lower than our combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.  The   third   quarter   2015   rate was lower than the Company s combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a rate lower than our combined federal and state rate.

The following table compares   year-to-date 2016   comparable sales to   year-to-date 2015  : 

________ 
           (a) 
    The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels.  A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable store sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. Comparable store sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 
              (b) 
    Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
     The results by segment are as follows: 
  Victoria's Secret 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , net sales increased   $134 million   to   $5.192 billion  , comparable sales increased   1%   and comparable store sales were flat.  Net sales increased primarily due to increases in PINK and sport, driven by a compelling merchandise assortment that incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.  These results were partially offset by decreases in swim and apparel due to a strategic decision to exit these categories, core bras due to lower average unit retail prices, and beauty as we reposition the category. 
  Bath   Body Works 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , net sales increased   $165 million   to   $2.232 billion  , comparable sales increased   6%   and comparable store sales increased   4%  .  Net sales increased across most categories including home fragrance, Signature Collection and soaps and sanitizers, which all incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. 
  The increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in average dollar sales.

Victoria's Secret and Bath   Body Works International 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , net sales increased   $26 million   to   $299 million   primarily related to newly acquired Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in Greater China, company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in the U.K., and additional stores opened by our partners. These results were partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign currency at Victoria's Secret U.K. and Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories. 
  Other 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , net sales increased $1 million to   $362 million   primarily due to increases in our La Senza and Henri Bendel direct channels, partially offset by store closures and the negative impacts of foreign currency at La Senza. 
  Gross Profit  
  For   year-to-date 2016  , our gross profit decreased   $20 million   to $  3.181 billion  , and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to   39.3%   from   41.3%  , primarily driven by the following: 
  Victoria's Secret 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by a decline in merchandise margin due to clearance activity on non-go forward merchandise categories, promotions and pricing to drive trial in beauty and other key categories, and fabric cancellations related to restructuring activities.  Buying and occupancy expenses increased primarily driven by an increase in occupancy expense resulting from investments in real estate, partially offset by a decrease in catalogue costs.   
  The gross profit rate decrease was driven primarily by increases in the promotional and clearance activity described above, the expenses related to the restructuring activities and investments in store real estate, partially offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses due to decreased catalogue costs. 
  Bath   Body Works 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , the gross profit increase was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate. 
  The gross profit rate decrease was driven by an increase in occupancy expenses primarily due to investments in store real estate.  
  Victoria's Secret and Bath   Body Works International 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , the gross profit decrease was primarily due to higher occupancy expenses driven by investments in store real estate in Greater China and the U.K., and lower merchandise margin dollars at Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories due to the negative impacts of foreign currency and business performance.  These decreases were partially offset by increased merchandise margin dollars generated from higher net sales. 
  The gross profit rate decrease was driven primarily by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate and a decrease in the merchandise margin rate at Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories. 
  General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses  
  For   year-to-date 2016  , our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased   $79 million   to   $2.166 billion   primarily driven by increased store selling expenses related to higher sales volume and investments in selling to improve the customer experience, severance charges related to the Victoria's Secret restructuring and corporate expenses in Greater China. 
  The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to   26.8%   from   26.9%   primarily due to leverage from higher sales, partially offset by deleverage associated with the Victoria's Secret restructuring and corporate expenses in Greater China. 
  Other Income and Expense 
  Interest Expense 
  The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for   year-to-date 2016   and   2015  : 

For   year-to-date 2016  , our interest expense increased   $58 million   to   $295 million   primarily due to an increase in average borrowings related to the October 2015 $1 billion note issuance.

     Table of Contents  

Other Income 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , our other income increased   $8 million   to   $83 million   primarily driven by a distribution received from Easton Town Center, LLC resulting in a pre-tax gain of   $108 million  , partially offset by a   $36 million   pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2017 Notes.  In 2015, we recognized a pre-tax gain of   $78 million   due to the divestiture of our remaining ownership interest in the third-party apparel sourcing business. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , our effective tax rate was   34.5%   compared to   35.2%     year-to-date 2015  .  The   year-to-date 2016   rate was lower than our combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.  The   year-to-date 2015   rate was lower than our combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the foreign portion of the divestiture of our third-party apparel sourcing business.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions and profit margins. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. 
  We believe in returning value to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase programs.  During   2016  , we have paid   $1.096 billion   in regular and special dividends and repurchased   $410 million   of our common stock.  We use cash flow generated from operating activities and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. 
  Our total cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were   $282 million   as of   October 29, 2016  . Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are repatriated to the U.S., in certain circumstances we may be subject to additional income taxes.

The following table provides our debt balance, net of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts, as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

_______________ 
      
  Issuance of Notes 
  In June 2016, we issued   $700 million   of   6.75%   notes due in July 2036.  The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by our Guarantors.  The proceeds from the issuance were   $692 million  , which were net of issuance costs of   $8 million  . These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of July 2036 and are included within Long-term Debt on the   October 29, 2016   Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  In October 2015, we issued   $1 billion   of   6.875%   notes due in November 2035.  The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by our Guarantors.  The proceeds from the issuance were   $988 million  , which were net of issuance costs of   $12 million  .  These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of November 2035 and are included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Repurchase of Notes 
  In July 2016, we used the proceeds from the 2036 Notes to repurchase the   $700 million   2017 Notes for   $742 million  .  The pre-tax loss on extinguishment of this debt was   $36 million   (after-tax net loss of $22 million), which is net of gains of   $7 million   related to terminated interest rate swaps associated with the 2017 Notes.  This loss is included in Other Income in the year-to-date 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income. 
  Revolving Facilities 
  We maintain a secured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Facility ). The Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of   $1 billion   and expires July 18, 2019. The fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are   0.30%   per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are   1.50%   per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings or British pound borrowings is LIBOR plus   1.50%   per annum. The interest rate on outstanding Canadian dollar borrowings is CDOR plus   1.50%   per annum.

     Table of Contents  

The Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than   1.75   to   1.00   and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding   4.00   to   1.00   for the most recent four-quarter period.  In addition, the Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than   3.00   to   1.00   and (b) no default or event of default exists.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than   3.00   to   1.00  . 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. 
  The Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had   $8 million   of outstanding letters of credit as of   October 29, 2016   that reduce our remaining availability under our Revolving Facility. 
  In addition to the Revolving Facility, we maintain various revolving and term loan bank facilities with availability totaling   $100 million   to support our foreign operations ("Foreign Facilities"). Current borrowings on these Foreign Facilities mature between November 15, 2016 and October 26, 2017. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. 
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we borrowed   $10 million   and made payments of   $4 million   under the Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time during   2016   was   $23 million  . As of   October 29, 2016  , there were borrowings of   $23 million   outstanding under the Foreign Facilities. 
  Interest Rate Swap Arrangements 
  We have interest rate swap arrangements related to   $300 million   of the outstanding 2019 Notes that are designated as interest rate fair value hedges.  The interest rate swap arrangements effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the related debt to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed percentage.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps have an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet.  The differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap arrangements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. 
  Working Capital and Capitalization 
  We believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements. 
  The following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  :

Our borrowing costs under our Revolving Facility are linked to our credit ratings at Moody s, S P and Fitch. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings by Moody s, S P or Fitch, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively.  The guarantees of our obligations under the Revolving Facility by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors  collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level.  Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Revolving Facility on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels.  Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt. 
  Common Stock Share Repurchases 
  Under the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased shares of our common stock under the following repurchase programs for   year-to-date 2016   and   2015  : 

In the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new   $500 million   share repurchase program, which included   $17 million   remaining under the June 2015 repurchase program. 
  The February 2016 repurchase program had   $90 million   remaining as of   October 29, 2016  . Subsequent to   October 29, 2016  , we repurchased an additional   0.2 million   shares of common stock for   $11 million   under this program. 
  There were   no   share repurchases reflected in Accounts Payable on the   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our share repurchase programs.  The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion taking into account a number of factors including market conditions. 
  Dividend Policy and Procedures 
  Under the authority and declaration of our Board of Directors, we paid the following dividends during   year-to-date 2016   and   2015  : 

Our Board of Directors will determine future dividends and share repurchase authorizations after giving consideration to the Company's levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time.  We use cash flow generated from operating activities to fund our ordinary dividends and a combination of cash flow generated from operating activities and financing activities to fund our special dividends and share repurchases.

Cash Flow 
  The following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity for   year-to-date 2016   and   2015  : 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities in   2016   was   $316 million  , including net income of   $526 million  .  Net income included depreciation and amortization of   $378 million  , gain on distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC of   $108 million  , share-based compensation expense of   $70 million  , excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of   $39 million  , and loss on extinguishment of debt of   $36 million  . Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital.  The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal increases in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year.  In addition, our Income Taxes Payable decrease was due to seasonal tax payments. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities in   2015   was   $262 million  , including net income of   $617 million  . Net income included depreciation and amortization of   $335 million  , gain on divestiture of the third-party apparel sourcing business of   $78 million  , share-based compensation expense of   $73 million   and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of   $65 million  . Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital.  The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal increases in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year.  In addition, our Income Taxes Payable decrease was due to seasonal tax payments. 
  Investing Activities  
  Net cash used for investing activities in   2016   was   $721 million   consisting primarily of capital expenditures of   $825 million   and   $33 million   related to the acquisition of our Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories franchise partner's operations and stores in Greater China, partially offset by a   $108 million   return of capital from Easton Town Center, LLC and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of   $10 million  .  The capital expenditures included   $691 million   for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores.  Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.  
  Net cash used for investing activities in   2015   was   $332 million   consisting primarily of capital expenditures of   $603 million   and purchases of marketable securities of   $60 million  , partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of   $196 million  , the divestiture of the third-party apparel sourcing business of   $85 million   and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of   $50 million  .

Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations 
  In connection with the disposition of certain businesses, we have remaining guarantees of approximately   $18 million   related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancellable leases expiring at various dates through 2021. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, our guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. We have not recorded a liability with respect to these guarantee obligations as we concluded that payments under these guarantees were not probable as of   October 29, 2016  . 
  In connection with the sale and leaseback under noncancellable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term.  The leases expire in 2020, and the total amount of the guarantees is approximately   $105 million  .  We recorded a liability of   $3 million   related to these guarantee obligations as of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , which is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and the related interest payments, operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other long-term obligations. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since   January 30, 2016  , as discussed in "Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations" in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than the issuance of the 2036 Notes and the repurchase of the 2017 Notes. Certain of our contractual obligations may fluctuate during the normal course of business (primarily changes in our merchandise inventory-related purchase obligations which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our operations). 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2018, with early adoption as of fiscal year 2017 permitted.  The standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method.  We are currently evaluating this standard, including the transition method and timing of adoption, and the related impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  This guidance requires companies classified as lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today s accounting.  The new standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  The standard requires modified retrospective adoption and will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating this standard, including the timing of adoption, and the related impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.  
  Simplifying the Presentation of Share-Based Compensation 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This guidance requires companies to recognize income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.  The standard also will require all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows, and any cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employee's behalf as financing activities.  The standard will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We have determined that we will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  We are currently evaluating the related impact on our  Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.

IMPACT OF INFLATION 
    
  While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor. 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Market Risk 
  The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We use derivative financial instruments like cross-currency swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
  We have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  To mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our Canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a cross-currency swap related to a Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan. This cross-currency swap requires the periodic exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar principal payments upon maturity. The swap arrangement matures in January 2018 at the same time as the related loan. As a result of the Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan and the related cross-currency swap, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our Canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate.  
  In addition, our Canadian dollar, British pound and Chinese yuan denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in Canada, the U.K. and China is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with Canadian dollar and British pound denominated earnings, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates.  
  Further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in U.S. dollars, the royalties we receive in U.S. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency.  As a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities.  Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer.  The primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk.  Typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.  Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.  
  The majority of our long-term debt as of   October 29, 2016  , has fixed interest rates.  We will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of   $300 million   related to a portion of our 2019 Notes.  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

The effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate.  The variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in three-month LIBOR.    
  For the balance of our long-term debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity. 
  The following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

_______________ 
           (a) 
    The estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. 
              (b) 
    Hedge arrangements are in an asset position. 
     Concentration of Credit Risk 
  We maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. We also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.

Item 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting.    In August 2016, we implemented a new Human Resources and Payroll system. Various processes and controls were modified due to the new system. Additionally, we implemented additional compensating controls over financial reporting to ensure the accuracy and integrity of our financial statements during the post-implementation phase. We believe the system and process changes will enhance internal control over financial reporting in future periods. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
