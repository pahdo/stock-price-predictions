1.      NATURE
                                         OF OPERATIONS   

Organization   

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. on April 21, 2006.  

Exploration
Stage Activities   

The
Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining
claims. Upon location of a commercial minable reserve, the Company expects to actively prepare the site for its extraction and
enter a development stage. During the fiscal year 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Mayan Mineral Ltd. to acquire
a resource property in Nevada (Note 4). Currently, the Company is actively looking for other mineral properties for its planned
business operation.  

Going
Concern   

These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
( US GAAP ) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business.  

The
general business strategy of the Company is to acquire and explore mineral properties. The continued operations of the Company
and the recoverability of mineral property costs is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable mineral reserves,
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of its properties, and upon future profitable
production. The Company has not generated any revenues or completed development of any properties to date. Further, the Company
has a working capital deficit of $502,828 (June 30, 2016 - $504,817), has incurred losses of $609,888 since inception, and further
significant losses are expected to be incurred in the exploration and development of its mineral properties. The Company will
require additional funds to meet its obligations and maintain its operations. There can be no guarantee that the Company will
be successful in raising the necessary financing. Management s plans in this regard are to raise equity financing as required.  

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.  

2.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Because a precise determination of many assets
and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the
use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. The financial statements
have, in management s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of
the significant accounting policies summarized below.

2.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

a)    Cash    

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
There are no cash equivalents as at September 30, 2016 (June 30, 2016: $nil).  

b)    Mineral
                                         Property Acquisition Payments    

The
Company expenses all costs incurred on mineral properties to which it has secured exploration rights prior to the establishment
of proven and probable reserves. If and when proven and probable reserves are determined for a property and a feasibility study
prepared with respect to the property, then subsequent exploration and development costs of the property will be capitalized.  

The
Company regularly performs evaluations of any investment in mineral properties to assess the recoverability and/or the residual
value of its investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change
which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  

c)    Exploration
                                         Expenditures    

The
Company follows a policy of expensing exploration expenditures until a production decision in respect of the project and the Company
is reasonably assured that it will receive regulatory approval to permit mining operations, which may include the receipt of a
legally binding project approval certificate.  

d)    Asset
                                         Retirement Obligations    

The
Company has adopted ASC 410,  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations , which requires that an asset retirement
obligation ( ARO ) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the
period which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset.  

The
cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized ARO, is depleted, such that the cost of the ARO is recognized over
the useful life of the asset. The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted
liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash flow,
discounted at the Company s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. To date, no significant asset retirement obligation
exists due to the early stage of exploration. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded.

2.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

e)    Use
                                         of Estimates and Assumptions    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the Date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

f)    Financial
                                         Instruments    

ASC
820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the
fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes
the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

Level
2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.  

The
Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loan payable and
due to a related party. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which
consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all of the other
financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.  

The
Company s operations are in Canada, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The
financial risk is the risk to the Company s operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree
of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency
risk.

2.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

g)    Income
                                         Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes  and ASC 740   Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which require the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  

h)    Basic
                                         and Diluted Net Loss per Share    

The
Company reports basic loss per share in accordance with ASC 260    Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share
is computed using the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed
using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss
per share is equal to basic loss per share because there are no potential dilutive securities.  

i)    Foreign
                                         Currency Translation    

The
Company s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are translated at the historical rate unless
such items are carried at market value, in which case they are translated using exchange rates that existed when the value were
determined. Any resulting exchange rate differences are recorded in the statement of operations.  

3.     RECENT
                                         ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU provides guidance on determining when
and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires
management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements
are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   

The
ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-15 and an estimate of the impact to the interim consolidated financial statements
cannot be made at this time.  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (ASU 2014-09). This accounting standard supersedes all existing US GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Under ASU 2014-09,
a company will recognize revenue when it transfers the control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration which the company expects to collect in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will require additional
disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated
financial statements cannot be made at this time.

                                         ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (Continued)   

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718,
Compensation   Stock Compensation. The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment
transactions.  

ASU
2016-09 is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within that reporting period. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected
as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  

The
Company is evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its interim consolidated financial statements. There have been no
other accountings pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company which are expected to have a material impact on the
Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments,  which clarifies the accounting guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual reporting period. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

The
Company does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial
statements.  

4.      MINERAL
                                         CLAIM INTEREST   

On
August 15, 2013, the Company entered into a Quitclaim Deed (the  Deed ) with Kee Nez Resources, LLC ( Grantor ),
a Utah limited liability company. Pursuant to the Deed, the Grantor, in consideration of $10 and other valuable consideration,
remise, release, and forever quitclaim unto the Company all of Grantor s right, title, and interest in and to the GSR group
of unpatented lode mining claims situated in Churchill Country, Nevada. As a result, the Company has obtained title to the GSR
claims in August 2013.  

The
Company did not incur further expenditures on the property during the period ending September 30, 2016 (June 30, 2016: $nil) due
to lack of cash.

MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

This
section of the quarterly report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to
future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate,
anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place
undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or our predictions.  

Plan
of Operation   

We
are a start-up, exploration Stage Corporation and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations.  

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business
for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues
and do not anticipate generating any revenues until we begin removing and selling minerals. There is no assurance we will ever
achieve these goals. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than the sale of minerals in order to implement our project
and stay in business. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others.  

Our
exploration target is to find a mineralized material, specifically, an ore body containing gold. Our success depends upon finding
mineralized material. This includes a determination by our consultant that the property contains reserves. We have not yet selected
a consultant. Mineralized material is a mineralized body which has been delineated by appropriate spaced drilling or underground
sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metals to justify removal. If we don t find mineralized material
or if it is not economically feasible to remove it, we will cease operations and you will lose your investment.  

In
addition, we may not have enough money to complete the acquisition and exploration of a property. If it turns out that we have
not raised enough money to complete our acquisition we will try to raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private
placement or through loans. At the present time, we have not made any plans to raise additional money and there is no assurance
that we would be able to raise additional money in the future. If we need additional money and cannot raise it, we will have to
suspend or cease operations.  

Research
  Development   

As
an exploration stage company in the mining industry we are not involved in any research and development.  

Effects
of Compliance with Environmental Laws   

As
a company in the mining industry we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations.  We strive to comply
with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are currently taking the steps indicated above.  We
believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations on environmental matters.  These
laws and regulations, on federal, state and local levels, are evolving and frequently modified and we cannot predict accurately
the effect, if any, they will have on its business in the future.  In many instances, the regulations have not been
finalized, or are frequently being modified. Even where regulations have been adopted, they are subject to varying and contradicting
interpretations and implementation. In some cases, compliance can only be achieved by capital expenditure and we cannot accurately
predict what capital expenditures, if any, may be required.  

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital   

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage
corporation and have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations.
Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources,
possible delays in the acquisition and exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price increases in services.  

To
become profitable and competitive, we need to identify a property and conduct research and explore our property before we start
production of any minerals we may find. If we do find mineralized material, we will need additional funding to move beyond the
research and exploration stage. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing
is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could
result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
have completed our public offering as of March 28, 2007 and to date have raised $107,060, we will attempt to raise additional
money through a subsequent private placement, public offering or through loans.  

Currently,
we do not have sufficient funds for our intended business operation. Ms. Miller, one of our officers and directors, has agreed
in financing the related operating expenditures to maintain the Company. The foregoing agreement is oral; we have nothing in writing.
While Ms. Miller has agreed to advance the funds, the agreement is unenforceable as a matter of law because no consideration was
given. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash. If we need additional cash and can't raise
it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described
in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.  

Since
inception, we have issued 7,070,000 shares of our common stock and received $107,060.  

In
March 2006, we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Kathrine MacDonald, our former secretary/treasurer, in consideration
of $30 and we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Marilyn Miller, one of our officers and directors, in consideration of
$30 pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1993.  

We
issued 1,070,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933. This was accounted for as a purchase of shares of common stock.

2. PROPERTIES   

Summary   

The
following is a description of the Company s mineral properties. The Company holds a 100% interest on four contiguous Federal
BLM unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada that were acquired for mineral exploration purposes, primarily in exploration for
precious metals.  

The
Property   

The
four GSR lode mining claims, named GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4, were staked on Federal BLM lands on July 9, 2012 by Kee Nez Resources, LLC,
a Utah limited liability company.   The BLM claim
numbers for claims GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 1076314, 1076315, 1076316 and 1076317 respectively. Each of the four claims are 20.66
acres in size for a total of 82.64 acres.  

The
Company acquired these unpatented claims on August 15, 2013, from Kee Nez Resources, LLC, who quitclaimed the four claims to the
Company. This transfer was filed and recorded with the BLM on August 23, 2013. As a result, Golden Star Resource Corp. holds a
100% interest in the four claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalties.  

A
Maintenance Fee or a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification must be filed annually on or before September 1st in order to keep the
claims valid and is filed in advance for the upcoming assessment year. Since the Company holds less than 10 Federal unpatented
lode mining claims it is entitled to file a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification in lieu of paying the fee of $155 per claim.
Payment of the Maintenance Fee or filing of the Fee Waiver Certification is the responsibility of Golden Star Resource Corp. Notice
of Holding of these claims is also filed annually with Churchill County.  

  All
requirements have been met until the next annual due date of September 1, 2016.  

There
are no buildings, equipment or other facilities on the claims. Sources of power and water have not been investigated to date.  

The
Company only has mineral rights by virtue of these claims. It does not hold any surface rights.  

Location   

The
GSR 1-4 unpatented lode mining claims are situated in Sections 9 and 16, T14N, R35E, MDM, in Churchill County, Nevada.  

The
property is located 98 air miles southeast of Reno, NV and 48 air miles southeast of Fallon, NV. The property can be accessed
from Fallon by heading east on US Hwy 50 for 46 miles and then heading south on NV 361 for 15 miles. This paved highway cuts across
the southeast corner of the claim group (see Fig 2).  

Location
Map:

Geology   

The
GSR property lies in the Basin and Range Province near its western margin where it adjoins the northwest-southeast trending Walker
Lane mineral belt. This boundary is about 20 miles west of the GSR property. The Basin and Range Province is a major physiographic
region of the western US, centered on Nevada and western Utah, typified by north-northeast trending mountain ranges separated
by broad flat alluvium filled valleys. Gold and silver mineralization is known to occur in many parts of this Province.  

In
the vicinity of the GSR property there are numerous historical small mine workings in the surrounding mountain ranges, an active
exploration project at Bell Mt. 8 miles to the northwest and several past producing large gold mines, such as Paradise Peak 25
miles to the southeast and Rawhide 25 miles to the west.  

The
near-surface rocks in the area of the GSR property are a series of sub-outcropping Mesozoic Age metasedimentary rocks overlain
by Tertiary Age rhyolitic lavas and volcanoclastics.  

No
exploration has been carried out on the property by GSR and it has not been examined by a GSR contracted professional geologist
or by GSR s officers or directors.  

Due
to current subdued market conditions in the junior natural resource markets the Company has no plans for an exploration program
until it has the ability to raise sufficient funds to engage in an exploration program. Such a program would likely initially
entail prospecting, geological mapping and rock-chip sampling. Quality Assurance and Quality Controls for sampling collection
protocols will be developed with the exploration program as funding allows. There would be no permitting or bonding requirements
for this preliminary phase of exploration. Permits and bonding would be required if and when exploration advanced to a drilling
or trenching phase since those activities cause surface disturbance.  

The
property is currently without any known reserves and any program to be proposed in the future would be exploratory in nature.
