  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    

Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
    
  The unaudited   condensed consolidated financial statements   of T-Mobile US, Inc. ( T-Mobile,   we,   our,   us  or the  Company ) include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.  The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year.  The   condensed consolidated financial statements   should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The   condensed consolidated financial statements   include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries.  We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities ( VIE ) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   
    
  Certain prior period amounts relating to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  See  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year  below. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States ( U.S. ) generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.  These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  We offer products and services to customers through bundled arrangements, which may be comprised of multiple contracts entered into with a customer at or near the same time.  We assess such agreements as a single bundled arrangement that may involve multiple deliverables, which include wireless devices, wireless services or a combination thereof.  For multiple deliverable arrangements revenue is allocated between the separate units of accounting based on such components  relative selling prices on a standalone basis. 
    
  In June 2016, we introduced #GetThanked, which offers eligible customers the following free promotional items as part of their T-Mobile service: 

T-Mobile stock - A share of T-Mobile stock to eligible new (through December 31, 2016) or existing (as of June 6, 2016) customers.  Shares issued to customers under this promotion are purchased by an independent third-party broker in the open market on behalf of eligible customers.  The associated cost, which is paid by T-Mobile, is recorded as a reduction of service revenue for existing customers and as a reduction of equipment revenue for new customers in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  .  Through December 31, 2016, existing eligible customers can also receive a share of T-Mobile stock (subject to a maximum of   100   shares in a calendar year) for every new active account they refer, purchased by the third-party broker and paid for by T-Mobile.  The cost of shares issued under this refer-a-friend program are included in   Selling, general and administrative   expense in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  ; 

Weekly surprise items - Each Tuesday, eligible customers who download the T-Mobile Tuesday app are informed about and can redeem products and services offered by participating business partners.  The associated cost is included in   Selling, general and administrative   expense in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  ; and 

In-flight Wi-Fi - A full hour of in-flight Wi-Fi free to eligible customers on their smartphone on all Gogo-equipped domestic flights.  The associated cost, which is paid by T-Mobile, is included in Cost of services in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  .

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The standard requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected.  We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the changes retrospectively.  The implementation of this standard did not have a significant impact on our   condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for shared-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  We elected to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016, as permitted.  The impacts on our   condensed consolidated financial statements   from the adoption of this standard are as follows: 

Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   - A   $38 million   decrease to the January 1, 2016   Accumulated deficit   balance from the recognition, on a modified retrospective basis, of all previously unrecognized income tax attributes related to share-based payments; 

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income   - On a prospective basis, all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based payments will be recognized through   Income tax expense  .  Prior period amounts were not adjusted; and   

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows   - On a prospective basis, as permitted, excess tax benefits related to share-based payments will be presented as operating activities.  Prior period amounts were not adjusted. 
       
  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), and has since modified the standard with ASU 2015-14,  Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   The standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes identification of the contract, identification of the performance obligations, determination of the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.  We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective beginning January 1, 2018; however, early adoption with the original effective date for periods beginning January 1, 2017 is permitted.  Under ASU 2014-09, two adoption methods are allowed.  Under one method, a company may apply the rules to contracts in all reporting periods presented, subject to certain allowable exceptions.  Under the other method, a company may apply the rules to all contracts existing as of January 1, 2018 (provided early adoption is not elected), recognizing an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous rules.  We continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard and available adoption methods on our consolidated financial statements and believe the standard will result in the implementation of new revenue accounting systems, processes and internal controls over revenue recognition. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.   The standard requires all lessees to report a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most leases.  The income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification.  The standard requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the  bright line  classification tests.  For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.  The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 and will require recognizing and measuring leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the standard and the timing of adoption but expect that it will have a material impact on our   consolidated financial statements  . 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable

forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount.  The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 and will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to   Accumulated deficit   as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach).  Early adoption is permitted for us as of January 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our   consolidated financial statements   and the timing of adoption.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The standard provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows, including beneficial interests in securitization, which would impact the presentation of the deferred purchase price from sales of receivables.  The standard is intended to reduce current diversity in practice.  The standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and will require a retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our   consolidated financial statements   and the timing of adoption.  

Note 2   Significant Transactions    
    
  Spectrum License Transactions    
    
  The following table summarizes our spectrum license activity: 

We had the following spectrum license transactions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

We closed on the agreement with AT T Inc. for the acquisition and exchange of certain spectrum licenses.  Upon closing of the transaction during the first quarter of   2016  , we recorded the spectrum licenses received at their estimated fair value of approximately   $1.2 billion   and recognized a gain of   $636 million   included in   Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses   in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  . 

We closed on agreements with multiple third parties for the purchase and exchange of certain spectrum licenses for   $1.3 billion   in cash.  Upon closing of the transactions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded spectrum licenses received at their estimated fair values totaling approximately   $1.7 billion   and recognized gains of   $199 million   included in   Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses   in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  . 

We entered into an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain spectrum licenses, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.  Our spectrum licenses to be transferred as part of the exchange transaction were reclassified as assets held for sale and were included in   Other current assets   in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   at their carrying value of   $86 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .   

We entered into an agreement with a third party for the purchase of certain spectrum licenses covering approximately   11 million   people for approximately   $420 million  .  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 
       
  Debt 
    
  In March   2016  , T-Mobile USA, Inc. ( T-Mobile USA ), a subsidiary of T-Mobile US, Inc., and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG ( Deutsche Telekom ), our majority stockholder, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom   $2.0 billion   of   5.300%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the    5.300%   Senior Notes ) for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.0 billion  .  If T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the   5.300%   Senior Notes on or prior to November 30, 2016, the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction.  As

     Table of Contents  

of   September 30, 2016  , if the commitment under this purchase agreement was terminated, the reimbursement amount due to Deutsche Telekom would not be significant. 
    
  In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, (i) issued   $1.0 billion   of public   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024, (ii) entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to   $1.35 billion   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024 and (iii) entered into another purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell up to an additional   $650 million   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024.   
    
  The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes that may be issued under the   $1.35 billion   purchase agreement will be approximately   103.316%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.  If T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the   6.000%   Senior Notes under the   $1.35 billion   purchase agreement on or prior to November 5, 2016 or elects to issue less than   $1.35 billion   of   6.000%   Senior Notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction.  As of   September 30, 2016  , if the commitment under this purchase agreement was terminated, the reimbursement amount due to Deutsche Telekom would not be significant. 
    
  The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes that may be issued under the   $650 million   purchase agreement will be approximately   104.047%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.  If T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the   6.000%   Senior Notes under the   $650 million   purchase agreement on or prior to November 5, 2016 or elects to issue less than   $650 million   of   6.000%   Senior Notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction.  As of   September 30, 2016  , if the commitment under this purchase agreement was terminated, the reimbursement amount due to Deutsche Telekom would not be significant. 
    
  In addition to the new debt issued, and purchase commitments with Deutsche Telekom, the supplemental indentures governing the Senior Reset Notes to affiliates provided for the adjustment of the interest rates on such Notes at various reset dates to rates determined in accordance with the applicable supplemental indenture.  In April   2016  , the interest rate on the   $600 million   of Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 was adjusted from   5.950%   to   9.332%  .  
    
  Other 
    
  In June 2016, a refundable deposit of   $2.2 billion   was made to a third party in connection with a potential asset purchase.  The deposit is included in   Asset purchase deposit   in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . 
    
  During the quarter ended and subsequent to September 30, 2016, a handset Original Equipment Manufacturer ( OEM ) announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices.  As a result, we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value.  The OEM has agreed to reimburse T-Mobile, as such, we have recorded an amount due from the OEM as an offset to the loss recorded in Cost of equipment sales in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income   and a reduction to   Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . 

Note 3   Sales of Certain Receivables 
    
  We have entered into transactions to sell certain service and Equipment Installment Plan ( EIP ) accounts receivables.  The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our financial statements, are described below. 
    
  Sales of Service Receivables  
    
  Overview of the Transaction 
    
  In 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivables on a revolving basis with a current maximum funding commitment of   $750 million   and scheduled expiration date in   March 2017   (the  service receivable sale arrangement ).  The service receivable sale arrangement provided funding of   $750 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Sales of receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis.  The receivables consist of service charges currently due from customers and are short-term in nature.

     Table of Contents  

In connection with the service receivable sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity to sell service accounts receivables ( Service BRE ).  Service BRE does not qualify as a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ), and due to the significant level of control we exercise over the entity, it is consolidated.  Pursuant to the arrangement, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries transfer selected receivables to Service BRE.  Service BRE then sells the receivables to an unaffiliated entity ( Service VIE ), which was established to facilitate the sale of beneficial ownership interests in the receivables to certain third parties. 
    
  Variable Interest Entity 
    
  We determined that Service VIE qualifies as a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities.  We have a variable interest in Service VIE, but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Service VIE s economic performance.  Those activities include committing Service VIE to legal agreements to purchase or sell assets, selecting which receivables are purchased in the service receivable sale arrangement, determining whether Service VIE will sell interests in the purchased service receivables to other parties, funding of the entities and servicing of receivables.  We do not hold the power to direct the key decisions underlying these activities.  For example, while we act as the servicer of the sold receivables, which is considered a significant activity of the VIE, we are acting as an agent in our capacity as the servicer and the counterparty to the service receivable sale arrangement has the ability to remove us as the servicing agent of the receivables at will with no recourse available to us.  As we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, the results of Service VIE are not consolidated into our   condensed consolidated financial statements  .   
    
  The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets (primarily the deferred purchase price) and liabilities included in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   that relate to our variable interest in Service VIE: 

Sales of EIP Receivables 
    
  Overview of the Transaction 
    
  In 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivables on a revolving basis with a maximum funding commitment of   $800 million   (the  EIP sale arrangement ).  In June 2016, the EIP sale arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to   $1.3 billion   with a scheduled expiration date in   November 2017  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the EIP sale arrangement provided funding of   $1.2 billion   and   $800 million  , respectively.  Sales of EIP receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis.  The receivables consist of customer EIP balances, which require monthly customer payments for up to 24 months. 
    
  In connection with this EIP sale arrangement, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity ( EIP BRE ).  Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, our wholly-owned subsidiary transfers selected receivables to EIP BRE.  EIP BRE then sells the receivables to a non-consolidated and unaffiliated third-party entity for which we do not exercise any level of control, nor does the entity qualify as a VIE. 
    
  Variable Interest Entity 
    
  We determined that EIP BRE is a VIE as its equity investment at risk lacks the obligation to absorb a certain portion of its expected losses.  We have a variable interest in EIP BRE and determined that we are the primary beneficiary based on our ability to direct the activities which most significantly impact EIP BRE s economic performance.  Those activities include selecting which receivables are transferred into EIP BRE and sold in the EIP sale arrangement and funding of EIP BRE.  Additionally, our equity interest in EIP BRE obligates us to absorb losses and gives us the right to receive benefits from the EIP BRE that could potentially be significant to EIP BRE.  Accordingly, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary, and include the balances and results of operations of EIP BRE in our   condensed consolidated financial statements  .

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets (primarily the deferred purchase price) and liabilities included in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   that relate to our EIP BRE: 

In addition, EIP BRE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to any liquidation of EIP BRE, to be satisfied prior to any value in EIP BRE becoming available to us.  Accordingly, the assets of EIP BRE may not be used to settle our general obligations and creditors of EIP BRE have limited recourse to our general credit. 
    
  Sales of Receivables 
    
  The transfers of service receivables and EIP receivables to the non-consolidated entities are accounted for as sales of financial assets.  Once identified for sale, the receivable is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  Upon sale, we derecognize the net carrying amount of the receivables.  We recognize the net cash proceeds in Net cash provided by operating activities in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  .   
    
  The proceeds are net of the deferred purchase price, consisting of a receivable from the purchasers that entitles us to certain collections on the receivables.  We recognize the collection of the deferred purchase price in Net cash provided by operating activities as it is dependent on collection of the customer receivables and is not subject to significant interest rate risk.  The deferred purchase price represents a financial asset that is primarily tied to the creditworthiness of the customers and which can be settled in such a way that we may not recover substantially all of our recorded investment, due to default by the customers on the underlying receivables.  We elected, at inception, to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in   Selling, general and administrative   expense in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  .  The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), including customer default rates.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our deferred purchase price related to the sales of service receivables and EIP receivables was   $588 million   and   $389 million  , respectively. 
    
  The following table summarizes the impacts of the sale of certain service receivables and EIP receivables in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  : 

We recognized losses from sales of receivables of   $59 million   and   $26 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $157 million   and   $139 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These losses from sales of receivables were recognized in   Selling, general and administrative   expense in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  .  Losses from sales of receivables include adjustments to the receivables  fair values and changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price.

Continuing Involvement 
    
  Pursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables and are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where write-off is imminent.  We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee.  As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales.  While servicing the receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures to the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers.  Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, under certain circumstances, we are required to deposit cash or replacement EIP receivables for contracts terminated by customers under our JUMP! Program. 
    
  In addition, we have continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the sale arrangements.  Our maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables sold under the sale arrangements was   $1.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The maximum exposure to loss, which is a required disclosure under GAAP, represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances whereby we would not receive the deferred purchase price portion of the contractual proceeds withheld by the purchasers and would also be required to repurchase the maximum amount of receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements without consideration for any recovery.  As we believe the probability of these circumstances occurring is remote, the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of our expected loss. 

Note 4   Equipment Installment Plan Receivables 
    
  We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to   24   months using an EIP.   
    
  The following table summarizes the EIP receivables:   

We use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer at the time of application for mobile communications service using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores and service plan characteristics.  Based upon customer credit profiles, we classify EIP receivables into the credit categories of  Prime  and  Subprime.   Prime customer receivables are those with lower delinquency risk and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher delinquency risk.  Subprime customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases.  In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category are required to pay an advance deposit. 
    
  EIP receivables for which invoices have not yet been generated for the customer are classified as Unbilled.  EIP receivables for which invoices have been generated but which are not past the contractual due date are classified as Billed   Current.  EIP receivables for which invoices have been generated and the payment is past the contractual due date are classified as Billed   Past Due. 

13 

     Table of Contents  

The balance and aging of the EIP receivables on a gross basis by credit category were as follows:   

The increase in subprime EIP receivables as a percentage of total EIP receivables is primarily due to the EIP sale arrangement funding increase during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   in the unamortized imputed discount and allowance for credit losses balances for the EIP receivables was as follows: 

The EIP receivables had weighted average effective imputed interest rates of   9.2%   and   8.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  

Note 5   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    
    
  The carrying amounts and fair values of our short-term investments and long-term debt included in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   were as follows: 

Short-term Investments    
    
  The fair value of our short-term investments as of   December 31, 2015  , which consisted of U.S. Treasury securities, was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore was classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  We did not have any short-term investments as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Long-term Debt    
    
  The fair value of our Senior Notes to third parties was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore was classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates was determined based on a discounted cash flow approach using quoted prices of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for the stand-alone credit risk of T-Mobile.  Accordingly, our Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.   

14 

     Table of Contents  

Although we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Reset Notes to affiliates.  The fair value estimates were based on information available as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange.   
    
  Deferred Purchase Price Assets 
    
  In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates.  There were no significant changes in fair value for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  See   Note 3   Sales of Certain Receivables   for further information.  
    
  Guarantee Liabilities 
    
  We offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone ( JUMP! ), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device.  For customers who enroll in the device trade-in program, we defer the portion of equipment revenues which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee incorporating the expected probability and timing of the handset upgrade and the estimated fair value of the used handset which is returned.  Accordingly, our guarantee liabilities were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities.  Guarantee liabilities were   $140 million   and   $163 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in   Other current liabilities   in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . 
    
  The total estimated remaining gross EIP receivable balances of all enrolled handset upgrade program customers, which are the remaining EIP amounts underlying the JUMP! guarantee, including EIP receivables that have been sold, was   $2.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .  This is not an indication of our expected loss exposure as it does not consider the expected fair value of the used handset or the probability and timing of the trade-in. 

Note 6   Earnings Per Share    
    
  Basic earnings per share amounts are computed by dividing net income, after the deduction of preferred stock dividends declared by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share amounts assume the issuance of common stock for potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding. 
    
  The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows: 

Potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share if to do so would have been anti-dilutive.

  Operating Leases and Purchase Commitments 
    
  Future minimum payments for non-cancelable operating leases and purchase commitments are summarized below: 

In May   2016  , we entered into a purchase agreement with a third party for the acquisition of certain spectrum licenses for   $420 million  .  See   Note 2   Significant Transactions   for further information. 
    
  Related-Party Commitments 
    
  In March   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom   $2.0 billion   of   5.300%   Senior Notes due 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.0 billion  . 
    
  In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to   $1.35 billion   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024.  The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes to be issued under this purchase agreement will be approximately   103.316%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.  
    
  In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to   $650 million   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024.  The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes will be approximately   104.047%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. 
    
  See   Note 2   Significant Transactions   -   Debt   for further information. 
    
  Contingencies and Litigation 
    
  T-Mobile is involved in various lawsuits, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings ( Litigation Matters ) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include numerous court actions alleging that T-Mobile is infringing various patents.  Virtually all of the patent infringement cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages, although they occasionally seek injunctive relief as well.  The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could include an award of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months, if they are not otherwise resolved.  T-Mobile has established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the   condensed consolidated financial statements   but that T-Mobile does not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material.  An accrual is established when T-Mobile believes it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated.  For other matters, where the Company has not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company has not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to: uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; uncertain damage theories and demands; and a less than fully developed factual record.  While T-Mobile does not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period.  This assessment is based on T-Mobile s current  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

understanding of relevant facts and circumstances.  As such, T-Mobile s view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future. 
    
  On April 4, 2012, T-Mobile was sued in a patent infringement case by Prism Technologies LLC ( Prism ) in federal court in Nebraska.  After a jury trial resulted in a defense verdict, the court entered judgment in favor of T-Mobile.  Both parties have appealed.  Absent a significant adverse change in the status of the case, the Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this case will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Note 8   Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense was   $232 million   and   $100 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $651 million   and   $61 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The effective tax rate was   38.8%   and   42.0%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   37.8%   and   12.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The lower effective income tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   resulted primarily from the increase in income before income taxes and the resulting decrease in the impact of unfavorable tax items.  The higher effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   resulted from income tax benefits for discrete income tax items recognized in   2015   that did not impact   2016  , including certain changes in state and local income tax laws and the recognition of certain federal tax credits.  The increase in the effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was partially offset by the recognition of   $24 million   of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in   Income tax expense   resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016.  See   Note 1   Basis of Presentation   for further information. 

Note 9   Guarantor Financial Information 
    
  Pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, issued by T-Mobile USA ( Issuer ) is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile ( Parent ) and certain of the Issuer s   100%   owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries ). 
    
  In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued   $1.0 billion   of public   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024. 
    
  The guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions.  The indentures governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets.  Certain provisions of each of the indentures and the supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to Parent.  However, the Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of the indentures and the supplemental indentures. 
    
  Presented below is the condensed consolidating financial information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Overview 
    
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results.  The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited   condensed consolidated financial statements   included in   Part I, Item 1   of this   Form 10-Q   and audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Unless expressly stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this MD A refer to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Business Overview 
    
  In June 2016, we introduced #GetThanked, a history-making move dedicated exclusively to saying  thank you  to our customers.  This program, offered to our customers as part of their T-Mobile service:  (i) offers eligible new (through December 31, 2016) or existing (as of June 6, 2016) customers ownership in the Company with a free share of T-Mobile stock or an additional share of T-Mobile stock for every new active account each customer refers through December 31, 2016, subject to a maximum of 100 shares in a calendar year, (ii) enables eligible customers who download the T-Mobile Tuesday app to be informed about and to redeem products and services offered by participating business partners each Tuesday and (iii) offers eligible customers a full hour of free in-flight Wi-Fi on their smartphone on all Gogo-equipped domestic flights. 
    
  In September 2016, we introduced the latest in our Un-carrier initiatives, T-Mobile ONE and T-Mobile ONE Plus, a move that gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text, and unlimited high-speed 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) data.  On T-Mobile ONE, video typically streams at DVD (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3G speeds.

  On September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current Mobile Virtual Network Operator ( MVNO ) partner for nominal consideration (the  MVNO Transaction ).  Upon the sale, the MVNO Transaction resulted in a transfer of   1,365,000   branded postpaid phone customers and   326,000   branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers.  Prospectively from September 1, 2016, revenue for these customers is recorded within wholesale revenues in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  . Additionally, the impact of the MVNO Transaction resulted in improvements to branded postpaid phone churn for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the quarter ended and subsequent to September 30, 2016, a handset Original Equipment Manufacturer ( OEM ) announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices.  As a result, we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value.  The OEM has agreed to reimburse T-Mobile, as such, we have recorded an amount due from the OEM as an offset to the loss recorded in   Cost of equipment sales   in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income   and a reduction to   Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  .

higher lease revenues and an increase in the number of devices sold.  The increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was partially offset by a lower average revenue per device sold. 

Branded postpaid phone churn of   1.32%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     14   basis points, compared to the same period in   2015  .  Branded postpaid phone churn of   1.30%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     6   basis points, compared to the same period in   2015  .  The improvements in branded postpaid phone churn for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of the MVNO Transaction and increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace. 

Operating income of   $1.0 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $476 million  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Operating income of   $2.9 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.6 billion  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   increases   were primarily due to higher total revenues, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization primarily related to devices leased under our JUMP! On Demand Program, higher costs to support customer growth and retention initiatives and higher cost of equipment sales resulting from increases in the number of devices sold.  An additional factor driving the   increases   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   included gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of   $199 million   and   $835 million  , respectively, compared to   $1 million   and   $24 million  , for the same periods in   2015  . 

Net income of   $366 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $228 million  , or   165%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Net income of   $1.1 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $634 million  , or   145%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increases were primarily a result of higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by higher interest expense related to higher average debt and higher income tax expense.  The   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   $122 million   and   $511 million   of net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, respectively. 

Adjusted EBITDA (see  Performance Measures ), a non-GAAP financial measure, of   $2.6 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $722 million  , or   38%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Adjusted EBITDA of   $7.8 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $2.7 billion  , or   53%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  These   increases   were primarily due to higher service revenues and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses.  An additional factor driving the   increase   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included lower losses on equipment primarily due to the impact of customers leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand.  

Net cash provided by operating activities of   $1.7 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $209 million  , or   14%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Net cash provided by operating activities of   $4.5 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.4 billion  , or   43%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   increases   were primarily due to an increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in Net income primarily due to changes in Depreciation and Amortization, Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and Deferred income tax expense as well as an increase in Net income.  The   increases   were partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital. 

Free Cash Flow (see  Performance Measures ), a non-GAAP financial measure, of   $581 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $170 million  , or   41%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Free Cash Flow of   $690 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $802 million  , or   716%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   increases   were primarily from higher net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment from the build-out of our LTE network.

  Revenues 
    
  Branded postpaid revenues     increased     $450 million  , or   11%  , for the   three months ended   and   $1.4 billion  , or   12%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to a   13%   and   15%   increase, respectively, in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices.  The growth in our customer base also drove increases in our device insurance program revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The increase for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was partially offset by an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash and from the impact of the MVNO Transaction.  Higher regulatory program revenues also contributed to the increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user ( ARPU ) primarily due to an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for Data Stash.  
    
  Branded prepaid revenues   increased     $288 million  , or   15%  , for the   three months ended   and   $729 million  , or   13%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in new markets.

Wholesale revenues     increased     $68 million  , or   40%  , for the   three months ended   and   $153 million  , or   31%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in data usage per customer and growth in customers of certain MVNO partners, including the impact of the MVNO Transaction.    
    
  Roaming and other service revenues     increased     $25 million  , or   61%  , for the   three months ended   and   $40 million  , or   31%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to higher international roaming revenues driven by an increase in inbound roaming volumes. 
    
  Equipment revenues     increased     $532 million  , or   38%  , for the   three months ended   and   $805 million  , or   16%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to the following: 

Increases of   $323 million   and   $1.0 billion   in lease revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program at the end of the second quarter of   2015  ;  
                
    An   increase   of   $209 million   in device sales revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a   19%     increase   in the number of devices sold.  Device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale. 
                
    A   decline   of   $227 million   in device sales revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to a lower average revenue per device sold resulting from promotions for devices and the impact of our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by a   5%     increase   in the number of devices sold as well as an increase in the number of accessories sold. 
       
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we provided   $1.4 billion   and   $4.2 billion  , respectively, in gross equipment installment plan ( EIP ) device financing to our customers, which   increased   by   $265 million   and   decreased   by   $107 million  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  .  The   increase   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in devices financed through EIP due to focus on devices financed on EIP in the third quarter of 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on JUMP! On Demand in the third quarter of   2015  .  The   decrease   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a decline in devices financed through EIP. 
    
  Other revenues     increased     $34 million  , or   26%  , for the   three months ended   and   $122 million  , or   34%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties.  Higher lease income associated with reciprocal spectrum license lease agreements also contributed to the increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Cost of services     increased     $58 million  , or   4%  , for the   three months ended   and   $116 million  , or   3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to higher regulatory program costs and expenses associated with network expansion and the build-out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses, including higher employee-related costs.  The   increases   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were partially offset by synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS Code Division Multiple Access ( CDMA ) network and lower long distance and toll costs.  In addition, higher lease expense associated with reciprocal spectrum license lease agreements contributed to the   increase   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Cost of equipment sales     increased     $554 million  , or   28%  , for the   three months ended   and   $207 million  , or   3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  . 

The   increase   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a   19%     increase   in the number of devices sold and a higher average cost per device sold; 
                
    The   increase   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a   5%     increase   in the number of devices sold as well as an increase in the number of accessories sold, partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold primarily due to the impact of our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015.  The impact from returned and purchased leased devices and an increase in insurance claims costs also contributed to the   increase   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer.

     Table of Contents  

Selling, general and administrative   increased     $274 million  , or   10%  , for the   three months ended   and   $985 million  , or   13%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily attributable to strategic investments to support our growing customer base, including higher employee-related costs, higher commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions and higher promotional costs. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization     increased     $411 million  , or   36%  , for the   three months ended   and   $1.4 billion  , or   41%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to   $367 million   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively, in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of   2015  , as well as   increases   resulting from the build-out of our LTE network.  With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value.  
    
  Cost of MetroPCS business combination   of   $15 million   for the   three months ended   and   $110 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination.  We do not expect to incur significant additional network decommissioning costs as cell site assets are removed in 2016.  
    
  Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses   of   $199 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of gains from spectrum license transactions during the   third quarter of     2016  .    Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses   of   $835 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   also included a gain of   $636 million   from a spectrum license transaction with AT T Inc. recorded in the first quarter of   2016  .  Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of   $24 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily consisted of a gain from a spectrum license transaction with Verizon recorded in the second quarter of   2015  .  See   Note 2   Significant Transactions   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
    
  Other Income (Expense)  
    
  Interest expense     increased     $114 million  , or   44%  , for the   three months ended   and   $303 million  , or   39%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to higher debt balances with third parties for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , as well as lower capitalized interest costs associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.   
    
  Interest expense to affiliates   decreased     $45 million  , or   37%  , for the   three months ended   and   $29 million  , or   10%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom AG ( Deutsche Telekom ) in 2015.  The   decreases   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were partially offset by an increase in interest rates on certain Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom, which were adjusted at reset dates in the   second quarter of      2016   and in   2015  , as well as lower capitalized interest costs associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.   
    
  Interest income   decreased     $47 million  , or   43%  , for the   three months ended   and   $137 million  , or   41%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to a decline in imputed interest income associated with devices financed through EIP resulting from sales of certain EIP receivables pursuant to our EIP receivables sales arrangement and following the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program at the end of the   second quarter of     2015  .  Interest associated with EIP receivables, which is imputed at the time of a device sale and then recognized over the financed installment term, was   $59 million   and   $189 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $108 million   and   $331 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  See   Note 4   Equipment Installment Plan Receivables   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  .  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense   was   $232 million   and   $100 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $651 million   and   $61 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The effective tax rate was   38.8%   and   42.0%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   37.8%   and   12.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The lower effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 resulted primarily from the increase in income before income taxes and the resulting decrease in the impact of unfavorable tax items.  The higher effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   resulted from income tax benefits for discrete income tax items recognized in   2015   that did not impact   2016  , including certain changes in state and local income tax laws and

the recognition of certain federal tax credits.  The increase in the effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was partially offset by the recognition of   $24 million   of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in   Income tax expense   resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016.  See   Note 1   Basis of Presentation   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  .

The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were as follows: 

The increases in Service revenues, Cost of equipment sales and Selling, general and administrative were primarily the result of an increase in activity of the non-guarantor subsidiary that provides device insurance, primarily driven by growth in our customer base.  All other results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company s consolidated results of operations.  See   Note 9   Guarantor Financial Information   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . 

Performance Measures 
    
  In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures.  These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements.  Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

  Customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period.  An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers.  We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis. 

Branded postpaid customers per account   increased   primarily due to ongoing service promotions targeting families, increased penetration of mobile broadband devices and the impact of the MVNO Transaction.  
    
  Churn 
    
  Churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period.  The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time.  We believe that churn provides management with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.     

Branded postpaid phone churn   decreased     14   basis points for the   three months ended   and   6   basis point for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , and was primarily impacted by the MVNO Transaction, which had a higher rate of branded postpaid phone churn and increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace.  If the MVNO transaction had occurred on July 1, 2016, reported postpaid phone churn would have been 12 basis points lower at 1.20% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Branded prepaid churn   decreased     27   basis points for the   three months ended   and   68   basis points for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , and was primarily impacted by a decrease in certain customers,

which had a higher rate of branded prepaid churn, as well as strong performance of the MetroPCS brand.  Additionally, branded prepaid churn for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was impacted by a methodology change in the third quarter of   2015   that had no impact on our reported branded prepaid ending customers or net customer additions, but resulted in computationally lower branded prepaid gross customer additions and deactivations.  Revision of prior periods in   2015   was not practicable because certain historical data was no longer available.  
    
  Average Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per User 
    
  ARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers.  We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base.  Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues.  
    
  Average Billings Per User ( ABPU ) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings, per customer.  We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month. 
    
  The following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:  

NM   Not Meaningful 
    
  Branded postpaid phone ARPU   increased     $0.16  , or flat, for the   three months ended   and   decreased     $0.38  , or   1%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferrals for Data Stash and dilution from continued growth of customers on promotions targeting families, partially offset by continued growth of our insurance programs and higher data attach rates.  The transfer of customers as part of the MVNO transaction contributed to the increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Higher regulatory program revenues also contributed to an increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Branded postpaid ABPU   increased     $0.42  , or   1%  , for the   three months ended   and   $0.21  , or flat, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to   increases   in lease revenues and the impact from the transfer of customers as part of the MVNO Transaction, partially offset by lower EIP billings, an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferrals for Data Stash, dilution from continued growth of customers on promotions targeting families and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices.  The   decreases   in EIP billings were primarily due to the impact of our JUMP! On Demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of   2015  . 
    
  Branded prepaid ARPU   increased     $0.55  , or   1%  , for the   three months ended   and   $0.12  , or flat, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in certain customers that had lower average branded prepaid ARPU, as well as higher data attach rates.  The   increases   were partially offset by dilution from growth of customers on rate plan promotions. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain expenses not reflective of T-Mobile s operating performance.  Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues.  Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations.  We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors.  Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments as well as non-cash stock-based compensation and certain other nonrecurring expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.  
    
  The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

Adjusted EBITDA   increased     $722 million  , or   38%  , for the   three months ended   and   $2.7 billion  , or   53%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to the following: 

Increased branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;  
                
    Higher gains on disposal of spectrum licenses; 
                
    Lower losses on equipment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the impact of customers leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, as the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.  In connection with JUMP! On Demand, we had lease revenues of   $353 million   and   $1.1 billion   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and depreciation expense of   $367 million   and   $1.2 billion   related to leased wireless devices for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively; and 
                
    Focused cost control and synergies realized from the MetroPCS business combination, primarily in cost of services; partially offset by 
                
    Higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to strategic investments to support our growing customer base, including higher employee-related costs, higher commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions and higher promotional costs. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, capital leases, common and preferred stock, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom.  
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following is an analysis of our year-to-date cash flows: 

NM   Not Meaningful 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities   increased     $1.4 billion  , or   43%  , primarily due to the following:  

$986 million   increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in net income primarily due to changes in   Depreciation and amortization  ,   Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses   and   Deferred income tax expense  ; 
                
    $634 million   increase in net income; partially offset by 
                
    $268 million   increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital primarily due to changes in   Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  ,   Equipment installment plan receivables  , including inflows from the EIP sale arrangement funding increase and   Inventories  .  
       
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash used in investing activities   decreased     $852 million  , or   16%  , to a use of   $4.4 billion   primarily due to the following: 

$3.8 billion   for the purchase of property and equipment primarily related to the build out of our LTE network; 
                
    $3.5 billion   for the purchase of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including a   $2.2 billion   deposit made to a third party in connection with a potential asset purchase; partially offset by 
                
    $3.0 billion   in sales of short-term investments. 

39 

     Table of Contents  

Financing Activities 
    
  Cash provided by financing activities   increased     $1.2 billion   to inflow of   $623 million   primarily due to the following: 

$997 million   from the issuance of long-term debt; partially offset by 
                
    $150 million   for repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net and  
                
    $133 million   for repayments of capital lease obligations. 
       
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents were   $5.4 billion  . 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
    
  Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment.  Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of T-Mobile s financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.   
    
  The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: 

Free Cash Flow   increased     $170 million   for the   three months ended   and   $802 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  .  These   increases   were primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment from the build-out of our LTE network, as described above.  
    
  Debt  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total debt was   $27.8 billion  , excluding our tower obligations, of which   $27.4 billion   was classified as long-term debt.  Significant debt-related activity during 2016 included: 

In March   2016  , T-Mobile USA, Inc. ( T-Mobile USA ), a subsidiary of T-Mobile US, Inc., and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom AG ( Deutsche Telekom ), our majority stockholder, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom   $2.0 billion   of   5.300%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the    5.300%   Senior Notes ) for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.0 billion  .  If T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the   5.300%   Senior Notes on or prior to November 30, 2016, the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction.  

In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to   $1.35 billion   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due   2024   and (iii) entered into another purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to an additional   $650 million   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due   2024  .  

The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes that may be issued under the   $1.35 billion   purchase agreement will be approximately   103.316%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.  If T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the   6.000%   Senior Notes under the   $1.35 billion   purchase agreement on or prior to November 5, 2016 or elects to issue less than   $1.35 billion   of   6.000%   Senior Notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase

agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction.  

In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into another purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom, in which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to an additional   $650 million   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due 2024.  The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes that may be issued under the   $650 million   purchase agreement will be approximately   104.047%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.  If T-Mobile USA does not elect to issue the   6.000%   Senior Notes under the   $650 million   purchase agreement on or prior to November 5, 2016 or elects to issue less than   $650 million   Senior Notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and T-Mobile USA must reimburse Deutsche Telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction.   

We have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have committed to   $1.1 billion   of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which   $679 million   was executed during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  We expect to enter into up to an additional   $121 million   in capital lease commitments during   2016  . 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was no outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom that allows for up to   $500 million   in borrowings.   
       
  See   Note 2   Significant Transactions   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional details.   
    
  We could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2016, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016, or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis.  Excluding any additional liquidity needed to acquire spectrum, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements in the next 12 months and intend to use our principal sources of funding for general corporate purposes, including capital investments other than spectrum licenses, and enhancing our financial flexibility.   
    
  We determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum.  We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors.  There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.   
    
  The indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets.  Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent.  However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties.  We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure.  Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network modernization, including the build out of LTE 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.  We expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of   $4.5 billion   to   $4.7 billion   in   2016  .  This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or purchases of spectrum licenses.

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods: 

(1) 
    Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements.  
              (2) 
    Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations.  
              (3) 
    T-Mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract.  Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest T-Mobile could exit these contracts.  For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased.  This table does not include open purchase orders as of   September 30, 2016   under normal business purposes.  
              (4) 
    Represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites as of   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  Certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment.  Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments.  In addition, because dividends on preferred stock are subject to approval by our Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred and the dividend has not been paid.  
    
  The purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business.  These amounts do not represent T-Mobile s entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed.  Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation.  Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 
    
  Spectrum License Agreement 
    
  In May   2016  , we entered into an agreement with a third party for the purchase of certain spectrum licenses covering approximately   11 million   people for approximately   $420 million  .  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  In 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis through November 2017 as an additional source of liquidity.  In June 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to   $1.3 billion   with a scheduled expiration date in   November 2017  .  In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through   March 2017   as an additional source of liquidity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of   $2.4 billion   upon sale through these arrangements.

Related-Party Transactions 
    
  In March   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom   $2.0 billion   of   5.300%   Senior Notes due 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.0 billion  . 
    
  In April   2016  , T-Mobile USA entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom up to   $1.35 billion   of   6.000%   Senior Notes due   2024  .  The purchase price for the   6.000%   Senior Notes that may be issued under the   $1.35 billion   purchase agreement will be approximately   103.316%   of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.

  Disclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
    
  Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ).  Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.   Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.   
    
  As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with Deutsche Telekom.  We have relied upon Deutsche Telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings. 
    
  Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company ( MTN Irancell ), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran.  For the    three months ended     September 30, 2016  , gross revenues of all Deutsche Telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than   $1.0 million   and estimated net profits were less than   $1.0 million  .  
    
  In addition, Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries.  Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were less than   $0.1 million  .  We understand that Deutsche Telekom intends to continue these activities.

  I, John J. Legere, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this   quarterly   report on   Form 10-Q   of T-Mobile US, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
       
           (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
