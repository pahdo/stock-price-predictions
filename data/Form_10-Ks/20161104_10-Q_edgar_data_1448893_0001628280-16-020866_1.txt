  The forward-looking statements contained in this   Quarterly Report   reflect our views as of the date of this   Quarterly Report   about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause events or our actual activities or results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, actions, levels of activity, performance or achievements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors described below, factors described in Part I, Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of this   Quarterly Report  , and factors described in   Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors    of our   Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
    
  In these notes to condensed   consolidated financial statements,  Essent ,  Company ,  we ,  us , and  our  refer to     Essent Group Ltd.     and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires  . 

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Essent Group Ltd.   (   Essent Group   )   is a Bermuda-based holding company, which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, offers private mortgage insurance and reinsurance for mortgages secured by residential properties located in the United States. Mortgage insurance facilitates the sale of low down payment (generally less than     20%  ) mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, primarily to two     government-sponsored enterprises   (   GSEs   ),   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  .  
    
  The primary mortgage insurance operations are conducted through Essent Guaranty, Inc. ( Essent Guaranty ), a wholly-owned subsidiary approved as a qualified mortgage insurer by the GSEs and is licensed to write mortgage insurance in all   50   states and the District of Columbia. Essent Guaranty reinsures   25%   of GSE-eligible new insurance written to Essent Reinsurance Ltd. ( Essent Re ), an affiliated Bermuda domiciled Class 3A Insurer licensed pursuant to Section 4 of the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 that provides insurance and reinsurance coverage of mortgage credit risk.  Essent Re also provides insurance and reinsurance to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In accordance with certain state law requirements, Essent Guaranty also reinsures that portion of the risk that is in excess of   25%   of the mortgage balance with respect to any loan insured, after consideration of other reinsurance, to Essent Guaranty of PA, Inc. ( Essent PA ), an affiliate. 
    
  In addition to offering mortgage insurance, we provide contract underwriting services on a limited basis through CUW Solutions, LLC ("CUW Solutions"), a Delaware limited liability company, that provides, among other things, mortgage contract underwriting services to lenders and mortgage insurance underwriting services to affiliates. 
    
  We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with   U.S. generally accepted accounting principles   (   GAAP   ) pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the statements include all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) required for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including Note 1 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included in our   Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which discloses the principles of consolidation and a summary of significant accounting policies. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. We evaluated the need to recognize or disclose events that occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2016   prior to the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2  . Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This update is intended to provide a consistent approach in recognizing revenue. In accordance with the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date for this update to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements; however, this update is not expected to impact the recognition of revenue related to insurance premiums or investments, which represent a significant portion of our total revenues. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09,   Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts (Topic 944)  . The amendments in this update require insurance entities to disclose certain information about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The additional information required is focused on improvements in disclosures regarding insurance liabilities, including the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows related to those liabilities and the effect of those cash flows on the statement of comprehensive income. The disclosures required by this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the new disclosures required by this ASU.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This update will require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)  . This update is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and treated as discrete items in the reporting period. In addition, excess tax benefits are required to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. Further, the new guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company expects to elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur and estimates that the initial adoption of this update will not have a material impact on stockholders' equity as of January 1, 2017. The classification of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense may result in net income volatility in reporting periods subsequent to 2016. To date, realized excess tax benefits have been recognized in additional paid-in-capital. The amount of excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies in future periods will vary based on the market value of the Company s common stock at the vesting dates of nonvested common share and nonvested common share units. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326)  . This update is intended to provide financial statement users with more information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new guidance requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected through the use of an allowance for credit losses. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance rather than as a write-down of the amortized cost of the securities. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. While the Company is still evaluating this ASU, we do not expect it to impact our accounting for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") as these items are not within the scope of this ASU.

The amortized cost and fair value of investments available for sale at     September 30, 2016  ,   by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Because most mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities provide for periodic payments throughout their lives, they are listed below in separate categories  . 

Gross gains and losses realized on the sale of investments available for sale were as follows:

  Essent Group Ltd. and Subsidiaries 
    
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position and the related unrealized losses were as follows  : 

The gross unrealized losses on these investment securities are principally associated with the changes in the interest rate environment subsequent to their purchase. Each issuer is current on its scheduled interest and principal payments. We assess our intent to sell these securities and whether we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis when determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary.   We recorded other-than-temporary impairments of   $73 thousand   and   $80 thousand   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, on securities in an unrealized loss position. The impairments resulted from our intent to sell these securities subsequent to the reporting date. There were   no   other-than-temporary impairments of investments in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The fair value of investments deposited with insurance regulatory authorities to meet statutory requirements was     $8.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $8.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .   In connection with its insurance and reinsurance activities, Essent Re is required to maintain assets in trusts for the benefit of its contractual counterparties. The fair value of the investments required to be on deposit in these trusts   was   $304.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $171.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Net investment income consists of:

Note 4. Accounts Receivable 
    
  Accounts receivable consists of the following: 

Premiums receivable consists of premiums due on our mortgage insurance policies. If mortgage insurance premiums are unpaid for more than   90 days  , the receivable is written off against earned premium and the related insurance policy is cancelled. For all periods presented,   no   provision or allowance for doubtful accounts was required. 

Note 5. Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve balances for losses and   loss adjustment expenses   (   LAE   ) for the   nine months ended September 30  : 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $3.2 million   was paid for incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years. There has been a   $4.7 million   favorable prior year development during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Reserves remaining as of   September 30, 2016   for prior years are   $9.8 million   as a result of re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $1.3 million   was paid for incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years. There had been a   $2.7 million   favorable prior year development during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Reserves remaining as of   September 30, 2015   for prior years were   $4.5 million   as a result of re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. In both periods, the favorable prior years' loss development was the result of a re-estimation of amounts ultimately to be paid on prior year defaults in the default inventory, including the impact of previously identified defaults that cured. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims.

Note 6. Debt Obligations 
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  On April 19, 2016, Essent Group and its subsidiaries, Essent Irish Intermediate Holdings Limited and Essent US Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the "Borrowers"), entered into a   three  -year, secured revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of   $200 million   (the  Facility ). Borrowings under the Facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, capital contributions to Essent s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Borrowings will accrue interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at the Company s option, plus an applicable margin.  A commitment fee is due quarterly on the average daily amount of the undrawn revolving commitment. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the senior unsecured debt rating or long-term issuer rating of Essent Group to the extent available, or the insurer financial strength rating of Essent Guaranty. The current annual commitment fee rate is   0.35%  . The obligations under the Facility are secured by certain assets of the Borrowers, excluding the stock and assets of its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The Facility contains several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels, maximum debt to capitalization level and Essent Guaranty's compliance with the PMIERS. This description is not intended to be complete in all respects and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Facility, including its covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants and   $50 million   had been borrowed under the Facility with an interest rate of   2.52%  . 

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Obligations under Guarantees 
    
  Under the terms of CUW Solutions' contract underwriting agreements with lenders and subject to contractual limitations on liability, we agree to indemnify certain lenders against losses incurred in the event that we make an error in determining whether loans processed meet specified underwriting criteria, to the extent that such error materially restricts or impairs the salability of such loan, results in a material reduction in the value of such loan or results in the lender repurchasing the loan. The indemnification may be in the form of monetary or other remedies. We paid   $93,008   and   $16,903   related to remedies for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes any potential claims for indemnification related to contract underwriting services through   September 30, 2016   are not material to our financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In addition to the indemnifications discussed above, in the normal course of business, we enter into agreements or other relationships with third parties pursuant to which we may be obligated under specified circumstances to indemnify the counterparties with respect to certain matters. Our contractual indemnification obligations typically arise in the context of agreements entered into by us to, among other things, purchase or sell services, finance our business and business transactions, lease real property and license intellectual property. The agreements we enter into in the normal course of business generally require us to pay certain amounts to the other party associated with claims or losses if they result from our breach of the agreement, including the inaccuracy of representations or warranties. The agreements we enter into may also contain other indemnification provisions that obligate us to pay amounts upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the negligence or willful misconduct of our employees, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or claims that performance of the agreement constitutes a violation of law. Generally, payment by us under an indemnification provision is conditioned upon the other party making a claim, and typically we can challenge the other party s claims. Further, our indemnification obligations may be limited in time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us under an indemnification agreement or obligation. As of   September 30, 2016  , contingencies triggering material indemnification obligations or payments have not occurred historically and are not expected to occur. The nature of the indemnification provisions in the various types of agreements and relationships described above are believed to be low risk and pervasive, and we consider them to have a remote risk of loss or payment. We have not recorded any provisions on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to indemnifications.

Note 8. Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The following table summarizes nonvested common share and nonvested common share unit activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

In February 2016, certain members of senior management were granted nonvested common shares under the Essent Group Ltd. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan that were subject to time-based and performance-based vesting. The time-based share awards granted in February 2016 vest in three equal installments on March 1, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The performance-based share awards granted in February 2016 vest based upon our compounded annual book value per share growth percentage during a   three  -year performance period that commenced on January 1, 2016 and vest on March 1, 2019. The portion of the nonvested performance-based share awards that will be earned based upon the achievement of compounded annual book value per share growth is as follows: 

In the event that the compounded annual book value per share growth falls between the performance levels shown above, the nonvested common shares earned will be determined on a straight-line basis between the respective levels shown. 
    
  In connection with our incentive program covering bonus awards for performance year 2015, in February 2016, time-based share awards and share units were issued to certain employees that vest in three equal installments on March 1, 2017, 2018 and 2019. In May 2016, time-based share units were granted to non-employee directors that vest   one year   from the date of grant.  
    
  The total fair value on the vesting date of nonvested shares or share units that vested was   $14.8 million   and   $21.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $19.3 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares or share units outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and we expect to recognize the expense over a weighted average period of   1.7   years. 
    
  Employees have the option to tender shares to Essent Group to pay the minimum employee statutory withholding taxes associated with shares upon vesting. Common shares tendered by employees to pay employee withholding taxes totaled   182,286   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The tendered shares were recorded at cost, included in treasury stock and have been cancelled as of   September 30, 2016  .

Note 9. Earnings per Share (EPS) 
    
  The following table reconciles the net income and the weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per common share: 

There were   1,574   and   905   antidilutive shares for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   128,569   and   100,232   antidilutive shares for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The nonvested performance-based share awards are considered contingently issuable for purposes of the EPS calculation. Based on the compounded annual book value per share growth as of   September 30, 2016  ,   100%   of the performance-based share awards would be issuable under the terms of the arrangements if   September 30, 2016   was the end of the performance period. Based on the compounded annual book value per share growth as of   September 30, 2015  ,   100%   of the performance-based share awards would have been issuable under the terms of the arrangements if   September 30, 2015   was the end of the performance period.

Note 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The estimated fair values and related carrying amounts of our financial instruments were as follows: 

Fair Value Hierarchy 
    
  ASC No. 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The level within the fair value hierarchy to measure the financial instrument shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets accessible at the measurement date. 

Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3   Valuations derived from one or more significant inputs that are unobservable. 

15 

     Table of Contents  
  Essent Group Ltd. and Subsidiaries 
    
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Determination of Fair Value 
    
  When available, we generally use quoted market prices to determine fair value and classify the financial instrument in Level 1. In cases where quoted market prices for similar financial instruments are available, we utilize these inputs for valuation techniques and classify the financial instrument in Level 2. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flows, present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates and estimates of future cash flows and we classify the financial instrument in Level 3. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 
    
  We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair values of financial instruments: 

Investments available for sale   Investments available for sale are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, when available, and those investments are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 investments available for sale include investments such as U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds. Investments available for sale are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy if quoted market prices are not available and fair values are estimated using quoted prices of similar securities or recently executed transactions for the securities. U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal debt securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are classified as Level 2 investments. 
       
  We use independent pricing sources to determine the fair value of securities available for sale in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We use one primary pricing service to provide individual security pricing based on observable market data and receive one quote per security. To ensure securities are appropriately classified in the fair value hierarchy, we review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service and believe that their policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the issue valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded. U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal and corporate debt securities are valued by our primary vendor using recently executed transactions and proprietary models based on observable inputs, such as interest rate spreads, yield curves and credit risk. Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are valued by our primary vendor using proprietary models based on observable inputs, such as interest rate spreads, prepayment speeds and credit risk. As part of our evaluation of investment prices provided by our primary pricing service, we obtained and reviewed their pricing methodologies which include a description of how each security type is evaluated and priced. We review the reasonableness of prices received from our primary pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from additional pricing sources. We have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from our primary pricing service. 

Derivative liabilities   We define fair value as the current amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability, other than in a forced liquidation. Through June 30, 2016, certain of our Freddie Mac Agency Credit Insurance Structure ("ACIS") contracts were accounted for as derivatives. In determining an exit market, we considered the fact that there is not a principal market for these contracts. In the absence of a principal market, we valued these ACIS contracts in a hypothetical market where market participants, and potential counterparties, included other mortgage guaranty insurers or reinsurers with similar credit quality to us. We believed that in the absence of a principal market, this hypothetical market provides the most relevant information with respect to fair value estimates. These ACIS contracts were classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, these contracts were amended and are now accounted for as insurance contracts rather than derivatives. 
       
  Through June 30, 2016, we determined the fair value of our derivative instruments primarily using internally-generated models. We utilized market observable inputs, such as the performance of the underlying pool of mortgages, mortgage prepayment speeds and pricing spreads on the reference STACR notes issued by Freddie Mac, whenever they were available. There was a high degree of uncertainty about our fair value estimates since our contracts were not traded or exchanged, which made external validation and corroboration of our estimates difficult. Considerable judgment was required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not have been indicative of amounts we could have realized in a market exchange or negotiated termination. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have had a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Changes in Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following table presents changes during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and the net realized and unrealized losses related to the Level 3 liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and in the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   Level 3 assets. 

The following table summarizes the significant unobservable inputs used in our recurring Level 3 fair value measurements as of   December 31, 2015  :  

The significant unobservable inputs used for derivative liabilities are constant prepayment rates ( CPR ) and default rates on the reference pool of mortgages and the credit spreads on the reference STACR notes. An increase in the CPR, default rate or reference STACR credit spread will increase the fair value of the liability.

Note 12  . Statutory Accounting 
    
  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by their respective state s department of insurance, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP. We did not use any prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices (individually or in the aggregate) that resulted in reported statutory surplus or capital that was significantly different from the statutory surplus or capital that would have been reported had National Association of Insurance Commissioners  statutory accounting practices been followed. The following table presents Essent Guaranty s and Essent PA s statutory net income, statutory surplus and contingency reserve liability as of and for the   nine months ended September 30  : 

Net income determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices differs from GAAP. In   2016   and   2015  , the more significant differences between net income determined under statutory accounting practices and GAAP for Essent Guaranty and Essent PA relate to policy acquisition costs and income taxes. Under statutory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred while such costs are capitalized and amortized to expense over the life of the policy under GAAP. We are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves when we purchase non-interest-bearing United States Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds ( T L Bonds ) issued by the Treasury Department. Under statutory accounting practices, this deduction reduces the tax provision recorded by Essent Guaranty and Essent PA and, as a result, increases statutory net income and surplus as compared to net income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the statutory capital of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which is defined as the total of statutory surplus and contingency reserves, was in excess of the statutory capital necessary to satisfy their regulatory requirements. 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA"), implemented new coordinated Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements, which we refer to as the "PMIERs." The PMIERs represent the standards by which private mortgage insurers are eligible to provide mortgage insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The PMIERs include financial strength requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that require approved insurers to have a sufficient level of liquid assets from which to pay claims. The PMIERs also include enhanced operational performance expectations and define remedial actions that apply should an approved insurer fail to comply with these requirements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Essent Guaranty, our GSE-approved mortgage insurance company, was in compliance with the PMIERs. 
    
  Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No.   58  ,   Mortgage Guaranty Insurance,   requires mortgage insurers to establish a special contingency reserve for statutory accounting purposes included in total liabilities equal to   50%   of earned premium for that year. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Essent Guaranty increased its contingency reserve by   $121.0 million   and Essent PA increased its contingency reserve by   $6.9 million  . This reserve is required to be maintained for a period of   120 months   to protect against the effects of adverse economic cycles. After   120 months  , the reserve is released to unassigned funds. In the event an insurer s loss ratio in any calendar year exceeds   35%  , however, the insurer may, after regulatory approval, release from its contingency reserves an amount equal to the excess portion of such losses. Essent Guaranty and Essent PA did not release any amounts from their contingency reserves in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

Under The Insurance Act 1978, as amended, and related regulations of Bermuda (the "Insurance Act"), Essent Re is required to annually prepare statutory financial statements and a statutory financial return in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of the Insurance Act, which is a basis other than GAAP. The Insurance Act also requires that Essent Re maintain minimum share capital of   $1 million   and must ensure that the value of its general business assets exceeds the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margins and enhanced capital requirement pertaining to its general business. At December 31, 2015, all such requirements were met. 
    
  Essent Re's statutory capital and surplus was   $333.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and statutory net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $35.8 million  .  
    
  Statutory capital and surplus and net income determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices differs from GAAP. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the more significant differences from GAAP for Essent Re relate to policy acquisition costs and accounting for insurance and certain reinsurance policies issued in connection with the ACIS program. Under statutory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged to expense when the related premiums are written while such costs are capitalized and amortized to expense over the life of the policy under GAAP. Under statutory accounting practices, the insurance and reinsurance policies issued in connection with the ACIS program are accounted for as insurance with premium received recorded as premiums earned. Through June 30, 2016, the insurance and certain reinsurance policies for the ACIS program were accounted for as derivatives under GAAP with the fair value of these policies reported as an asset or liability and changes in the fair value of these policies reported in earnings as a component of other income. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, these contracts were amended and are now accounted for as insurance contracts rather than derivatives. See Note 11.

  The following discussion should be read together with the  Selected Financial Data  and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and referred to herein as the  Annual Report,  and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included in Part I, Item 1 of this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  , which we refer to as the    Quarterly Report  .  In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in this   Quarterly Report   and Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report. We are not undertaking any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made. 
    
  Except as otherwise indicated,  Market Share  means our market share as measured by our share of total new insurance written ( NIW ) on a flow basis (in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions) in the private mortgage insurance industry, and excludes both NIW under the Home Affordable Refinance Program ( HARP  and such NIW, the  HARP NIW ) and bulk insurance (in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is insured in a single transaction). 

Overview 
    
  We are an established and growing private mortgage insurance company. We were formed to serve the U.S. housing finance industry at a time when the demands of the financial crisis and a rapidly changing business environment created the need for a new, privately funded mortgage insurance company. We had an estimated   12.4%   Market Share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We believe that our success in acquiring customers and growing our insurance in force has been driven by the unique opportunity we offer lenders to partner with a well-capitalized mortgage insurer, unencumbered by business originated prior to the financial crisis, that provides fair and transparent claims payment practices, and consistency and speed of service. 
    
  In 2010, Essent became the first private mortgage insurer to be approved by the GSEs since 1995, and we are licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We completed our initial public offering in November 2013. The financial strength of Essent Guaranty, Inc. ("Essent Guaranty"), our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, is rated   Baa2   with a   stable   outlook by Moody s Investor Services (   Moody's   ) and is rated   BBB+   with a   stable   outlook by Standard   Poor s Rating Services (   S P   ).   
    
  We had master policy relationships with approximately   1,340   customers as of   September 30, 2016  . Our holding company is domiciled in Bermuda and our U.S. insurance business is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania. We operate additional underwriting and service centers in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Irvine, California. We have a highly experienced, talented team with   372   employees as of   September 30, 2016  . We generated new insurance written of approximately   $10.3 billion   and   $24.5 billion   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to approximately   $7.6 billion   and   $20.2 billion   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $77.6 billion   of insurance in force. 
    
  We also offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through our wholly-owned Bermuda-based subsidiary, Essent Reinsurance, Ltd., which we refer to as "Essent Re." As of   September 30, 2016  , Essent Re provides insurance or reinsurance in connection with GSE risk share transactions covering approximately   $302.2 million   of risk on mortgage loans in reference pools associated with Freddie Mac's Agency Credit Insurance Structure ("ACIS") and Fannie Mae's Credit Insurance Risk Transfer ("CIRT") programs. Essent Re has also reinsured 25% of Essent Guaranty s GSE-eligible mortgage insurance NIW originated since July 1, 2014 under a quota share reinsurance agreement. On November 3, 2016, S P Global Ratings assigned its BBB+ long-term counterparty and financial strength ratings to Essent Re with a stable outlook. 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
    
  Our results are significantly impacted by, and our future success may be affected by, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the housing finance industry.   See Part I, Item 1  Business Regulation  and Part II, Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legislative and Regulatory Developments  in our Annual Report for a discussion of the laws and regulations to which we are subject as well as legislative and regulatory developments affecting the housing finance industry.

Effective December 31, 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA"), implemented new coordinated Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements, which we refer to as the "PMIERs." The PMIERs represent the standards by which private mortgage insurers are eligible to provide mortgage insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The PMIERs include financial strength requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that require approved insurers to have a sufficient level of liquid assets from which to pay claims. The PMIERs also include enhanced operational performance expectations and define remedial actions that apply should an approved insurer fail to comply with these requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  , Essent Guaranty, our GSE-approved mortgage insurance company, was in compliance with the PMIERs. See additional discussion in    Liquidity and Capital Resources  Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements.  

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
    
  Net Premiums Written and Earned 
    
  Premiums associated with our U.S. mortgage insurance business are based on insurance in force ("IIF") during all or a portion of a period. A change in the average IIF during a period causes premiums to increase or decrease as compared to prior periods. Average premium rates in effect during a given period will also cause premiums to differ when compared to earlier periods. IIF at the end of a reporting period is a function of the IIF at the beginning of such reporting period plus NIW less policy cancellations (including claims paid) during the period. As a result, premiums are generally influenced by: 

NIW, which is the aggregate principal amount of the new mortgages that are insured during a period. Many factors affect NIW, including, among others, the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and the competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages; 

Cancellations of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments on mortgages, home price appreciation, or refinancings, which in turn are affected by mortgage interest rates. Cancellations are also impacted by the levels of claim payments and rescissions; 

Premium rates, which represent the amount of the premium due as a percentage of IIF. Premium rates are based on the risk characteristics of the loans insured, the percentage of coverage on the loans, competition from other mortgage insurers and general industry conditions; and 

Premiums ceded or assumed under reinsurance arrangements. To date, we have not ceded any premiums under third-party reinsurance contracts. 
       
  Premiums are paid either on a monthly installment basis ( monthly premiums ), in a single payment at origination ( single premiums ), or in some cases as an annual premium. For monthly premiums, we receive a monthly premium payment which is recorded as net premiums earned in the month the coverage is provided. Monthly premium payments are based on the original mortgage amount rather than the amortized loan balance. Net premiums written may be in excess of net premiums earned due to single premium policies. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is recorded as  unearned premium  and earned over the estimated life of the policy, which ranges from 36 to 156 months depending on the term of the underlying mortgage and loan-to-value ratio at date of origination. If single premium policies are cancelled due to repayment of the underlying loan and the premium is non-refundable, the remaining unearned premium balance is immediately recognized as earned premium revenue. Substantially all of our single premium policies in force as of   September 30, 2016   were non-refundable. Premiums collected on annual policies are recognized as net premiums earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , monthly and single premium policies comprised   80.9%   and   19.1%   of our NIW, respectively. 
    
  Premiums associated with our GSE risk share transactions are based on the level of risk in force. 
    
  Persistency and Business Mix 
    
  The percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any 12-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, changes in persistency rates can have a significant impact on our profitability. The persistency rate on our portfolio was   79.4%   at   September 30, 2016  . Generally, higher prepayment speeds lead to lower persistency. 

22 

     Table of Contents  

Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single premium policies and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include certain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies, assuming all other factors remain constant, if loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, our premium earned with respect to those loans and therefore our profitability declines. Currently, the expected return on single premium policies is less than the expected return on monthly policies. 
    
  Net Investment Income 
    
  Our investment portfolio was predominantly comprised of investment-grade fixed income securities and money market funds as of   September 30, 2016  . The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the investment portfolio and the yield on individual securities. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair market value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of increases in capital and cash generated from or used in operations which is impacted by net premiums received, investment earnings, net claim payments and expenses. Realized gains and losses are a function of the difference between the amount received on the sale of a security and the security s amortized cost, as well as any  other-than-temporary  impairments recognized in earnings. The amount received on the sale of fixed income securities is affected by the coupon rate of the security compared to the yield of comparable securities at the time of sale. 
    
  Other Income 
    
  In connection with the acquisition of our mortgage insurance platform, we entered into a services agreement with Triad Guaranty Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation, which we refer to collectively as  Triad,  to provide certain information technology maintenance and development and customer support-related services. In return for these services, we receive a fee which is recorded in other income. This fee is adjusted monthly based on the number of Triad s mortgage insurance policies in force and, accordingly, will decrease over time as Triad s existing policies are cancelled. The services agreement was automatically extended until November 30, 2017 and provides for two subsequent one-year renewals at Triad s option. 
    
  Other income also includes revenues associated with contract underwriting services and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. The level of contract underwriting revenue is dependent upon the number of customers who have engaged us for this service and the number of loans underwritten for these customers. Through June 30, 2016, the insurance and certain of the reinsurance policies issued by Essent Re in connection with the ACIS program were accounted for as derivatives under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") with the fair value of these policies reported as an asset or liability and changes in the fair value of these policies reported in earnings. Changes in the fair value of these policies were impacted by changes in market observable factors. These policies were amended in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and are now accounted for as insurance rather than as derivatives.  
    
  Provision for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
    
  The provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects the current expense that is recorded within a particular period to reflect actual and estimated loss payments that we believe will ultimately be made as a result of insured loans that are in default. 
    
  Losses incurred are generally affected by: 

the overall state of the economy, which broadly affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans and have the ability to cure such defaults; 

changes in housing values, which affect our ability to mitigate our losses through the sale of properties with loans in default as well as borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the value of the home is below or perceived to be below the mortgage balance; 

the product mix of IIF, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher defaults and claims; 

the size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase losses incurred; 

the loan-to-value ratio, with higher average loan-to-value ratios tending to increase losses incurred; 
     
   23 

     Table of Contents  

the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with deeper average coverage tending to increase losses incurred; 

credit quality of borrowers, including higher debt-to-income ratios and lower FICO scores, which tend to increase incurred losses; 

the rate at which we rescind policies. Because of tighter underwriting standards generally in the mortgage lending industry and terms set forth in our master policy, we expect that our level of rescission activity will be lower than rescission activity seen in the mortgage insurance industry for vintages originated prior to the financial crisis  ; and 

the distribution of claims over the life of a book. The average age of our insurance portfolio is young with   80%   of our IIF as of   September 30, 2016   having been originated since January 1,   2014  . As a result, based on historical industry performance, we expect the number of defaults and claims we experience, as well as our provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses, to increase as our portfolio further seasons. See    Mortgage Insurance Earnings and Cash Flow Cycle  below. 
       
  We establish loss reserves for delinquent loans when we are notified that a borrower has missed at least two consecutive monthly payments ( Case Reserves ), as well as estimated reserves for defaults that may have occurred but not yet been reported to us ( IBNR Reserves ). We also establish reserves for the associated loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ), consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process, including legal and other fees. Using both internal and external information, we establish our reserves based on the likelihood that a default will reach claim status and estimated claim severity. See Part II, Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  included in our Annual Report for further information. 
    
  We believe, based upon our experience and industry data, that claims incidence for mortgage insurance is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   80%   of our IIF relates to business written since January 1,   2014   and substantially all of our policies in force are less than three years old. Although the claims experience on new insurance written by us to date has been favorable, we expect incurred losses and claims to increase as a greater amount of this book of insurance reaches its anticipated period of highest claim frequency. The actual default rate and the average reserve per default that we experience as our portfolio matures is difficult to predict and is dependent on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage, geographic concentrations, etc.), as well as the profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, the default rate and the average reserve per default will be affected by future macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates and employment. 
    
  Other Underwriting and Operating Expenses 
    
  Our other underwriting and operating expenses include components that are substantially fixed, as well as expenses that generally increase or decrease in line with the level of NIW. 
    
  Our most significant expense is compensation and benefits for our employees, which represented   64%   and   65%   of other underwriting and operating expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   62%   and   64%   of other underwriting and operating expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Compensation and benefits expense includes base and incentive cash compensation, stock compensation expense, benefits and payroll taxes. Compensation and benefits expense has steadily increased as we have increased our staffing from   332   employees at January 1,   2015   to   372   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily in our business development and operations functions to support the growth of our business. The growth in our sales organization contributed to the growth of our active customers and NIW. We also expanded our underwriting and customer service teams to support this new business. 
    
  Underwriting and other expenses include legal, consulting, other professional fees, premium taxes, travel, entertainment, marketing, licensing, supplies, hardware, software, rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization and other expenses. We anticipate that as we continue to add customers and increase our IIF, our expenses will also continue to increase. In addition, as a result of the increase in our IIF, we expect that our net premiums earned will grow faster than our underwriting and other expenses resulting in a decline in our expense ratio for the full year 2016 as compared to 2015 and for the full year 2017 as compared to 2016.

Income Taxes 
    
  Income taxes are incurred based on the amount of earnings or losses generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the applicable tax rates and regulations in those jurisdictions. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are generally not subject to income taxes in the states in which we operate; however, our non-insurance subsidiaries are subject to state income taxes. In lieu of state income taxes, our insurance subsidiaries pay premium taxes that are recorded in other underwriting and operating expenses. Essent Group Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Essent Re, are domiciled in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax. Effective July 2014, Essent Re began to reinsure 25% of GSE-eligible new insurance written of Essent Guaranty, an affiliate. Essent Re also provides insurance and reinsurance to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The amount of income tax expense or benefit recorded in future periods will be dependent on the jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax laws and regulations in effect. 
    
  Mortgage Insurance Earnings and Cash Flow Cycle 
    
  In general, the majority of any underwriting profit (premium revenue minus losses) that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of any underwriting profit realized in the first year. Subsequent years of a book generally result in modest underwriting profit or underwriting losses. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses. 

Key Performance Indicators 
    
  Insurance In Force 
    
  As discussed above, premiums we collect and earn are generated based on our IIF, which is a function of our NIW and cancellations. The following table includes a summary of the change in our IIF for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   for our U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio. In addition, this table includes our risk in force ("RIF") at the end of each period. 

Our cancellation activity has been relatively low to date because the average age of our insurance portfolio is young. The following is a summary of our IIF at   September 30, 2016   by vintage: 

25 

     Table of Contents  

Average Premium Rate 
    
  Our average premium rate is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) the risk characteristics and average coverage on the mortgages we insure; (2) the mix of monthly premiums compared to single premiums in our portfolio; (3) cancellations of non-refundable single premiums during the period; and (4) changes to our pricing. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our average premium rate was   0.58%   and   0.57%  , respectively, as compared to   0.55%   and   0.57%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Persistency Rate 
    
  The measure for assessing the impact of policy cancellations on IIF is our persistency rate, defined as the percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any twelve-month period. See additional discussion regarding the impact of the persistency rate on our performance in    Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations   Persistency and Business Mix.  
    
  Risk-to-Capital 
    
  The risk-to-capital ratio has historically been used as a measure of capital adequacy in the U.S. mortgage insurance industry and is calculated as a ratio of net risk in force to statutory capital. Net risk in force represents total risk in force net of reinsurance ceded and net of exposures on policies for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital for our U.S. insurance companies is computed based on accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. See additional discussion in    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Insurance Company Capital.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our combined net risk in force for our U.S. insurance companies was   $15.9 billion   and our combined statutory capital was   $1.1 billion  , resulting in a risk-to-capital ratio of   14.8 to 1  . The amount of capital required varies in each jurisdiction in which we operate; however, generally, the maximum permitted risk-to-capital ratio is 25.0 to 1. State insurance regulators are currently examining their respective capital rules to determine whether, in light of the financial crisis, changes are needed to more accurately assess mortgage insurers  ability to withstand stressful economic conditions. As a result, the capital metrics under which they assess and measure capital adequacy may change in the future. Independent of the state regulator and GSE capital requirements, management continually assesses the risk of our insurance portfolio and current market and economic conditions to determine the appropriate levels of capital to support our business. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , no capital contributions were made by Essent Group Ltd. to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , capital contributions of   $20.0 million   were made by Essent Group Ltd. to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated: 

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we reported net income of   $59.7 million  , compared to net income of   $40.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we reported net income of   $159.9 million  , compared to net income of   $112.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in our operating results in   2016   over the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to the   increase   in net premiums earned associated with the growth of our IIF, the   increase   in net investment income and favorable valuation adjustments associated with the ACIS contracts formerly accounted for as derivatives, partially offset by   increase  s in other underwriting and operating expenses, the provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses and income taxes. 
    
  Net Premiums Written and Earned 
    
  Net premiums earned   increase  d in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   by   32%   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the   increase   in our average IIF from   $59.9 billion   at   September 30, 2015   to   $75.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , as well as an increase in average premium rate from   0.55%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   0.58%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase in the average premium rate during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   is due primarily to an increase in premium earned on the cancellation of non-refundable single premium policies. Net premiums earned   increase  d in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   by   29%   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to the   increase   in our average IIF from   $55.8 billion   at   September 30, 2015   to   $70.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The average premium rate was   0.57%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The   increase   in net premiums written was due primarily to the   increase   in average IIF of   25%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   26%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015  . Net premiums written   increase  d in each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   by   19%  , over the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , unearned premiums   increase  d by   $5.1 million   and   $13.8 million  , respectively. The change in unearned premiums was a result of net premiums written on single premium policies of   $27.7 million   and   $27.6 million  , respectively, which was partially offset by   $22.6 million   and   $13.8 million  , respectively, of unearned premium that was recognized in earnings during the periods. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

unearned premiums increased by   $19.0 million   and   $35.0 million  , respectively. This was a result of net premiums written on single premium policies of   $77.9 million   and   $77.0 million  , respectively, which was partially offset by   $58.9 million   and   $42.0 million  , respectively, of unearned premium that was recognized in earnings during the period. 
    
  Net Investment Income 
    
  Our net investment income was derived from the following sources for the period indicated: 

The   increase   in net investment income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   was due to the   increase   in the weighted average balance of our investment portfolio and the increase in the pre-tax investment income yield. The average cash and investment portfolio balance was   $1.5 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.2 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The average cash and investment portfolio balance was   $1.4 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.1 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The pre-tax investment income yield increased from   1.9%   and   1.8%   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, to   2.0%   and   2.1%   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to an increase in the portion of our investment portfolio invested in spread assets. The pre-tax investment income yields are calculated based on amortized cost. See    Liquidity and Capital Resources  below for further details of our investment portfolio. 
    
  Other Income 
    
  Other income includes fees earned for information technology and customer support services provided to Triad, contract underwriting revenues and changes in the fair value of the insurance and certain reinsurance policies issued by Essent Re under the ACIS program. The   increase   in other income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a   $2.0 million   favorable valuation adjustment associated with an amendment to the ACIS contracts during the quarter. As a result of the amendment, these contracts are now accounted for as insurance rather than as derivatives.  The increase in other income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was also due to an increase in contract underwriting revenue. For the same period in   2015  , other income includes a   $1.3 million   increase in the estimated fair value of our ACIS contracts resulting from the decrease in observed prepayment speeds associated with the underlying pool of mortgages on the reference STACR notes. The   increase   in other income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to   $1.9 million   of favorable net valuation adjustments associated with the ACIS contracts formerly accounted for as derivatives, as well as an increase in contract underwriting revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Triad service fees associated with a reduction in the number of Triad's mortgage insurance policies in force. 
    
  Provision for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
    
  The   increase   in the provision for losses and LAE in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to   increase  s in the number of insured loans in default, partially offset by previously identified defaults that cured.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents a rollforward of insured loans in default for the periods indicated: 

The   increase   in the number of defaults at   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   was primarily due to the   increase   in our IIF and policies in force, as well as further seasoning of our insurance portfolio. 
    
  The following table includes additional information about our loans in default as of the dates indicated: 

The decrease in the average reserve per default was primarily due to changes in the composition (such as mark-to-market loan-to-value ratios, risk in force, and number of months past due) of the underlying loans in default.  
    
  The following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve balances for losses and LAE and a detail of reserves and defaulted RIF by the number of missed payments and pending claims:

     Table of Contents  

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the provision for losses and LAE was   $5.0 million  , comprised of   $6.8 million   of current year losses partially offset by   $1.9 million   of favorable prior years  loss development. During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the provision for losses and LAE was   $3.4 million  , comprised of   $4.3 million   of current year losses partially offset by   $0.9 million   of favorable prior years  loss development. In both periods, the prior years  loss development was the result of a re-estimation of amounts ultimately to be paid on prior year defaults in the default inventory, including the impact of previously identified defaults that cured. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the provision for losses and LAE was   $11.7 million  , comprised of   $16.4 million   of current year losses partially offset by   $4.7 million   of   favorable   prior years  loss development. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the provision for losses and LAE was   $7.7 million  , comprised of   $10.4 million   of current year losses partially offset by   $2.7 million   of   favorable   prior years  loss development. In both periods, the prior years  loss development was the result of a re-estimation of amounts ultimately to be paid on prior year defaults in the default inventory, including the impact of previously identified defaults that cured.

Other Underwriting and Operating Expenses 
    
  Following are the components of our other underwriting and operating expenses for the periods indicated: 

The significant factors contributing to the change in other underwriting and operating expenses are: 

Compensation and benefits   increase  d primarily due to the   increase   in our workforce to   372   at   September 30, 2016   from   332   at January 1,   2015  . Additional employees were hired to support the growth in our business, particularly in our sales organization, as well as our underwriting and customer service teams. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, wages and bonus, stock compensation expense, benefits and payroll taxes. 

Other expenses increased as a result of the continued expansion of our business. Other expenses include premium taxes, travel, marketing, hardware, software, rent, depreciation and amortization and other facilities expenses.   
       
  Income Taxes 
    
  Our subsidiaries in the United States file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. Our income tax expense was   $23.7 million   and   $18.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our income tax expense was   $64.7 million   and   $51.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate was   28.4%   and   31.5%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   28.8%   and   31.5%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For interim reporting periods, we use an annualized effective tax rate method required under GAAP to calculate the income tax provision. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our effective tax rate reflects the impact of the change in our expectations for the proportion of consolidated earnings to be generated in the United States compared to Bermuda in each year. We expect the proportion of our consolidated earnings generated in Bermuda to be higher in 2016 than in 2015 as a result of an increase in the amount of risk in force associated with insurance and reinsurance contracts executed with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the quota share reinsurance agreement between Essent Guaranty and Essent Re. Bermuda does not have a corporate income tax.   
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our sources of funds consist primarily of: 

our investment portfolio and interest income on the portfolio; 

net premiums that we will receive from our existing IIF as well as policies that we write in the future; 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility; and 

issuance of capital shares. 

31 

     Table of Contents  

Our obligations consist primarily of: 

claim payments under our policies; 

repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility; and 

the other costs and operating expenses of our business. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had substantial liquidity with cash of   $16.3 million  , short-term investments of   $150.5 million   and fixed maturity investments of   $1.4 billion  . We also had   $150 million   available under our revolving credit facility, with   $50 million   of borrowings outstanding under this facility. Borrowings accrue interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at the Company s option, plus an applicable margin. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the borrowings was   2.52%  . At   September 30, 2016  , net cash and investments at the holding company was   $44.6 million  .    
    
  Management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity available both at the holding company and in its insurance and other operating subsidiaries to meet its operating cash needs and obligations and committed capital expenditures for the next 12 months. 
    
  While the Company and all of its subsidiaries are expected to have sufficient liquidity to meet all their expected obligations, additional capital may be required to meet any new capital requirements that are adopted by regulatory authorities or the GSEs, or to provide additional capital related to the growth of our risk in force in our mortgage insurance portfolio, or to fund new business initiatives including the insurance activities of Essent Re. 
    
  At the operating subsidiary level, liquidity could be impacted by any one of the following factors: 

significant decline in the value of our investments; 

inability to sell investment assets to provide cash to fund operating needs; 

decline in expected revenues generated from operations; 

increase in expected claim payments related to our IIF; or 

increase in operating expenses. 
       
  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations prescribed by jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate and the GSEs. Under the insurance laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends during any twelve-month period in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 10% of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders' surplus or (ii) the preceding year s statutory net income. The Pennsylvania statute also requires that dividends and other distributions be paid out of positive unassigned surplus without prior approval. At   September 30, 2016  , Essent Guaranty had negative unassigned surplus of approximately   $4.6 million   and therefore would require prior approval by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to make any dividend payment or other distributions in   2016  . Essent Guaranty has paid no dividends since its inception. Essent PA had unassigned surplus of approximately   $7.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Essent PA paid to its parent company, Essent US Holdings, Inc., a   $3.75 million   dividend. Essent Re is subject to certain dividend restrictions as prescribed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and under certain agreements with counterparties. In connection with a quota share reinsurance agreement with Essent Guaranty, Essent Re has agreed to maintain a minimum total equity of $100 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , Essent Re had total equity of   $343.4 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , our insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these rules, regulations and agreements. In connection with its insurance and reinsurance activities, Essent Re is required to maintain assets in trusts for the benefit of its contractual counterparties. See   Note 3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cash Flows 
    
  The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 

Operating Activities 
    
  Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled   $198.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $159.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in cash flow provided by operating activities of   $39.6 million   in   2016   was primarily a result of increases in premiums collected and net investment income, partially offset by increases in expenses paid. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash flow used in investing activities totaled   $251.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $161.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in cash flow used in investing activities primarily related to investing cash flows from the business and investing the $50 million borrowed under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flow provided by financing activities totaled   $44.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to cash flow used of   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily related to the $50 million borrowing under the revolving credit facility. The proceeds of this borrowing were contributed to Essent Re to support new business. 
    
  Insurance Company Capital 
    
  We compute a risk-to-capital ratio for our U.S. insurance companies on a separate company statutory basis, as well as for our combined insurance operations. The risk-to-capital ratio is our net risk in force divided by our statutory capital. Our net risk in force represents risk in force net of reinsurance ceded, if any, and net of exposures on policies for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital consists primarily of statutory policyholders  surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and dividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. A mortgage insurance company is required to make annual contributions to the contingency reserve of 50% of net premiums earned. These contributions must generally be maintained for a period of ten years. However, with regulatory approval, a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35% of net premiums earned in a calendar year. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , no capital contributions were made by Essent Group Ltd. to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , capital contributions of   $20.0 million   were made by Essent Group Ltd. to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Our combined risk-to-capital calculation for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

For additional information regarding regulatory capital, see   Note 12   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our combined statutory capital equals the sum of statutory capital of Essent Guaranty plus Essent PA, after eliminating the impact of intercompany transactions. The combined risk-to-capital ratio equals the sum of the net risk in force of Essent Guaranty and Essent PA divided by combined statutory capital. The information above has been derived from the annual and quarterly statements of our insurance subsidiaries, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Such practices vary from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
    
  Essent Re has entered into risk share insurance and reinsurance transactions with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Essent Re also executed a quota share reinsurance transaction with Essent Guaranty to reinsure 25% of Essent Guaranty s GSE-eligible NIW effective July 1, 2014.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Essent Group Ltd. made capital contributions to Essent Re of   $80.0 million   to support new business. As of   September 30, 2016  , Essent Re had total stockholders  equity of   $343.4 million   and net risk in force of   $3.7 billion  . 
    
  Financial Strength Ratings 
    
  The insurer financial strength rating of Essent Guaranty, our principal mortgage insurance subsidiary, is   Baa2   with a   stable   outlook by   Moody's   and   BBB+   with a   stable   outlook by   S P  . On November 3, 2016, S P Global Ratings assigned its BBB+ long-term counterparty and financial strength ratings to Essent Re with a stable outlook. 
    
  Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at the direction of the FHFA, implemented new coordinated Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements, which we refer to as the "PMIERs." The PMIERs represent the standards by which private mortgage insurers are eligible to provide mortgage insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The PMIERs include financial strength requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that require approved insurers to have a sufficient level of liquid assets from which to pay claims. The PMIERs also include enhanced operational performance expectations and define remedial actions that apply should an approved insurer fail to comply with these requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  , Essent Guaranty, our GSE-approved mortgage insurance company, was in compliance with the PMIERs. As of   September 30, 2016  , Essent Guaranty's Available Assets were   $1.12 billion   and its Minimum Required Assets were   $1.06 billion   based on our interpretation of the PMIERs. 

Financial Condition 
    
  Stockholders  Equity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , stockholders  equity was   $1.3 billion   compared to   $1.1 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to net income generated in   2016  , as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an increase in our unrealized investment gains. 
    
  Investments 
    
  The total fair value of our investment portfolio was   $1.6 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.3 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . In addition, our total cash was   $16.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $24.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. Investment income is one of our primary sources of cash flow supporting operations and claim payments. The assets within the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance. While our investment portfolio is exposed to factors affecting markets worldwide, it is most sensitive to fluctuations in the drivers of U.S. markets. 
    
  We manage market risk via defined investment policy implemented by our treasury function with oversight from our board of directors and our senior management. Important drivers of our market risk exposure monitored and managed by us include but are not limited to: 

Changes to the level of interest rates.    Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the investment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable-rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse impact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates which may in turn require that the investment portfolio be restructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when market conditions are adverse. 

Changes to the term structure of interest rates.    Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve. These changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets. 

Market volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments.    Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified through changes to our own or third-party (e.g., rating agency) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments. 

Concentration Risk.    If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly correlated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated assets. 

Prepayment Risk.    Bonds may have call provisions that permit debtors to repay prior to maturity when it is to their advantage. This typically occurs when rates fall below the interest rate of the debt. 
       
  Market risk is measured for all investment assets at the individual security level. Market risks that are not fully captured by the quantitative analysis are highlighted. In addition, material market risk changes that occur from the last reporting period to the current are discussed. Changes to how risks are managed will also be identified and described. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the effective duration of our investment portfolio, including cash, was   3.5   years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of   3.5  % in fair value of our investment portfolio. Excluding cash, our investment portfolio effective duration was   3.9   years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of   3.9  % in fair value of our investment portfolio. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this   Quarterly Report  . Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this   Quarterly Report  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
