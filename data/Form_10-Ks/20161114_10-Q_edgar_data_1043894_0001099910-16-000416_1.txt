NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

NOTE A - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS

ORGANIZATION 

Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc., an Idaho corporation (the "Company"), is a provider of environmental and industrial separation technology. The Company has developed, and now manufactures and sells its patented technology, the Voraxial    Separator, a technology that efficiently separates liquid/liquid, liquid/solid or liquid/liquid/solid fluid streams with distinct specific gravities. Current and potential commercial applications and markets include oil exploration and production, oil refineries, oil spill, mining, manufacturing, waste-to-energy and food processing industry.

Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc., a Florida corporation ("FPA"), is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is used to manufacture, assemble and test the Voraxial Separator.

NOTE B - GOING CONCERN

The Company has experienced recurring net losses and a working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2016. There is no assurance that the Company's sales and marketing efforts will be successful enough to achieve a level of revenue sufficient to provide cash inflows to sustain operations; however, the Company continues to experience customer interest in 2016; however at a significantly lower rate than years past due to a challenging oil market environment. The Company may continue to require the infusion of capital until operations become profitable. As a result of the above, there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and the accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. If we fail to raise additional funds when needed, or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales, we may be required to scale back or cease operations, sell or liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The interim financial statements presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company's annual financial statements, notes and accounting policies included in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are necessary to provide a fair presentation of financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the related operating results and cash flows for the interim period presented, have been made. The results of operations, for the period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year. 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

ESTIMATES 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 

7 

ENVIRO VORAXIAL TECHNOLOGY, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ.  Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax asset, allowance for inventory obsolescence and valuation of stock-based compensation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company derives its revenue from the sale and short-term rental of the Voraxial Separator. The Company presents revenue in accordance with FASB new codification of "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements". Under Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, revenue is realized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

Revenues that are generated from sales of equipment are typically recognized upon shipment. Our standard agreements generally do not include customer acceptance or post shipment installation provisions. However, if such provisions have been included or there is an uncertainty about customer order, revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer order and all terms of the agreement have been complied with. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $150,315 and $249,228, respectively, of deposits from customers.

The Company recognizes revenue from the short term rental of equipment, ratably over the life of the agreement, which is usually one to twelve months.

FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS 

The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximate their fair value because of their relatively short-term nature.

"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires disclosures of information regarding the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. For purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale of liquidation.

The company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value is observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:

Level 1 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. We have no Level 1 instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Level 2 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. We have no Level 2 instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Level 3 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. We have no Level 3 instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash balances with various financial institutions. Balances at these institutions may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate ("FDIC") limits.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, balances did not exceed the FDIC limits.

INVENTORY 

Inventory consists of components for the Voraxial Separator and is priced at lower of cost or market. Inventory may include units being rented on a short term basis or components held by third parties in connection with pilot programs as part of the continuing evaluation by such third parties as to the effectiveness and usefulness of the service to be incorporated into their respective operations. The third parties do not have a contractual obligation to purchase the equipment. The Company maintains the title and risk of loss. Therefore, these units are included in the inventory of the Company. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

FIXED ASSETS 

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated economic useful life of the assets (5-10 years). Gains and losses recognized from the sales or disposal of assets is the difference between the sales price and the recorded cost less accumulated depreciation less costs of disposal.

NET LOSS PER SHARE 

In accordance with the accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260, " Earnings per Share"  basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.

During the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of 13,465,000 and 13,465,000 options, respectively, is anti-dilutive.  A separate computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is not presented.

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ("ASC 740-10-25"). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Business Segments 

The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES 

Research and development costs, which includes travel expenses, consulting fees, subcontractors and salaries are expensed as incurred.

ADVERTISING COSTS 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company adopted ASC Topic 718 formerly Statement of Financial Account Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires compensation expense relating to share-based payments to be recognized in net income using a fair-value measurement method. Under the fair value method, the estimated fair value of awards is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on the Company's net loss or cashflows.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the AICPA and the SEC, did not, or are not believed by management, to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements, except as follows:

In August 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.2015-14, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date"  defers the effective date ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

All other newly issued accounting pronouncements, but not yet effective, have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

NOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred salary expenses from the Chief Executive Officer of the Company of $228,750. Of these amounts, $7,500 has been paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The total unpaid balance as of September 30, 2016 is $1,547,409 and is included in accrued expenses   related party, the majority of which is payable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred salary expenses from the Chief Executive Officer of the Company of $208,950. Of these amounts, $49,770 had been

paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The total unpaid balance as of September 30, 2015 is $1,254,511 and is included in accrued expenses   related party, the majority of which is payable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer.

NOTE E - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS

WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS 

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, "Compensation   Stock Compensation." ASC Topic 718 establishes standards surrounding the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. ASC Topic 718 focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. 

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's stock options and warrants have characteristics different from those of its traded stock, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of such stock options. The risk free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities with a term similar to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company's history of having never issued a dividend and management's current expectation of future action surrounding dividends. Expected volatility was based on historical data for the trading of our stock on the open market. The expected lives for such grants were based on the simplified method for employees and officers.

Information with respect to options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016 is as follows:

Operating Lease 

In October 2015, the Company entered into a three (3) year lease for an office and manufacturing facility located at 821 NW 57 th  Place, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309. The lease is $6,100 per month, which includes common area maintenance, taxes and insurance. The Company has the option to terminate the lease with three months' notice.

LITIGATION 

On or about November 17, 2011, a claim was filed in the Broward County Circuit Court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida against the company by Raw Energy Tech, LLC. The plaintiff alleges breach of an oral contract between the parties for the alleged design, fabrication and construction of a prototype power pack. Amount of damages sought are approximately $58,000. We have moved to dismiss the complaint and intend to vigorously defend this action as we believe this claim is without merit. We have accrued an amount in the financial statements to cover our legal expenses as of September 30, 2016.

NOTE G   MAJOR CUSTOMERS

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded 95% of our revenue from one customer.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements.  Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. is referred to herein as "the Company", "we" or "our."  The words or phrases "would be," "will allow," "intends to," "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project," or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements". Such statements include those concerning our expected financial performance, our corporate strategy and operational plans.  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties.  Statements made herein are as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences, developments, unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statement.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company's consolidated condensed unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in the financial statements.  A summary of these significant accounting policies can be found in Note C to the Company's financial statements in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company has not adopted any significant new policies during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

Among the significant judgments made in preparation of the Company's financial statements are the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts, value of equity instruments and adjustments of inventory valuations. These adjustments are made each quarter in the ordinary course of accounting.

Overview

Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. was incorporated in Idaho on October 19, 1964, under the name Idaho Silver, Inc. In May of 1996, we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization with Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc., a privately held Florida corporation ("FPA"), and its shareholders. FPA was incorporated on February 26, 1993. We believe we are emerging as a potential leader in the rapidly growing environmental and industrial separation industries.  The Company has developed, manufactures and sells its patented Voraxial    Separator ("Voraxial    Separator" or "Voraxial   "), a proprietary technology that efficiently separates large volumes of liquid/liquid, liquid/solids or liquid/liquid/solids fluid mixtures with distinct specific gravities. Management believes this superior separation quality is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact, cost effective and energy efficient machine than any comparable product on the market today. Management believes the Voraxial fills a void in the market; specifically a real-time separation device that separates a large volume of liquids with a small footprints and without the need of a pressure drop. We believe the need for such a separation device overlaps many markets.

The Voraxial is capable of processing volumes as low as 3 gallons per minute as well as volumes over 5,000 gallons per minute with only one moving part. The Company believes that the Voraxial    technology can help protect the environment and its natural resources while simultaneously making numerous industries more productive and cost effective.

Results of Operations for the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

REVENUE 

Our revenues increased by $317,916 or approximately 530% to $377,888 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $59,972 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company believes the increase in revenues reflects a fluctuation in sales as the market conditions in the oil and gas market continues to be challenging due to the low oil prices.  The Company continues to negotiate with potential customers and, we believe there is a continued demand for our Voraxial Separators in the treatment and removal of contaminants from wastewater in markets that include oil exploration and production. However, the volume of customers and potential customers have declined significantly due to the market 

13 

conditions, specifically the low oil prices.  The low oil prices has delayed certain projects and decreases revenue potential in the near term.  We believe we have increased the exposure and awareness of the Voraxial Separator through the years with our marketing programs and expect to increase revenues from the sale and lease of the Voraxial Separator once oil prices and capital expenditures within the oil explorations and production sector recovers.  However, we have had to reduce our marketing budgets during these periods of low oil prices and believe these reductions will delay the recovery in revenues.  We continue to believe the markets for the Voraxial  Separator are developing as companies with high volume water separation problems are becoming aware of the Voraxial.

The Company is currently working on numerous opportunities with customers within the oil industry. We believe some of these opportunities will result in purchase orders in the remaining months of 2016 and fiscal year 2017.

Our cost of goods increased by $17,794 or 223% to $25,763 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $7,969 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to the increase  in sales. Our cost of goods continues to be reviewed by management in an effort to obtain the best available pricing while maintaining high quality standards.

COSTS AND EXPENSES 

Total costs and expenses increased by $68,453 or approximately 31% to $291,144 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $222,691 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our costs and expenses increased for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a reduction in salary and marketing expense and partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees.

Results of Operations for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

REVENUE  

Our revenues decreased by 28% to $441,378 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $613,846 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The Company believes the decrease in revenues reflects a fluctuation in sales as the market conditions in the oil and gas market continues to be challenging due to the low oil prices.  The Company continues to negotiate with potential customers and we believe there is a continued demand for our Voraxial Separators in the treatment and removal of contaminants from wastewater in markets that include oil exploration and production.  However, the volume of customers and potential customers have declined significantly due to the market conditions, specifically the low oil prices.  The low oil prices has delayed certain projects and decreases revenue potential in the near term.  We believe we have increased the exposure and awareness of the Voraxial Separator through the years with our marketing programs and expect to increase revenues from the sale and lease of the Voraxial Separator once oil prices and capital expenditures within the oil explorations and production sector recovers.  However, we have had to reduce our marketing budgets during these periods of low oil prices and believe these reductions will delay the recovery in our revenues in the near term.  We continue to believe the markets for the Voraxial  Separator are developing as companies with high volume water separation problems are becoming aware of the Voraxial.

COST OF GOODS 

Our cost of goods decreased to $37,086 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $155,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales and the different models sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our cost of goods continues to be reviewed by management to guarantee the best available pricing while maintaining high quality standards.

COSTS AND EXPENSES 

Total costs and expenses decreased by $17,650 or approximately 3% to $684,758 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $702,408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in our costs and expenses was primarily due to a reduction in salary and marketing expense and partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Cash at September 30, 2016 was $76,764. Working capital deficit at September 30, 2016 was $1,958,261 as compared to working capital deficit at December 31, 2015 of $1,586,075.

At September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $16,912,384.  We cannot be assured that we will generate revenues that will be self-sustaining. The Company may require the infusion of capital until operations become profitable. During the balance of 2016 and 2017, the Company may seek additional capital in the event it is unable to increase sales of the Voraxial Separator or continue to restrict expenses. If we fail to raise additional funds when needed, or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales, we may be required to scale back or cease operations, sell or liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Our chief executive officer has accrued the majority of his salary over the past several years and from time to time has advanced the company funds to satisfy operating expenses. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company has funded working capital requirements and intends, if necessary, to fund current working capital requirements through third party financing, including the private placement of securities. We cannot provide any assurances that required capital will be obtained or that terms of such required capital may be acceptable to us.

CONTINUING LOSSES 

We may be unable to continue as a going concern, given our limited operations and revenues and our significant losses to date. Since 2001, we have encountered expenses in the development of our Voraxial Separators and have had limited sales income from this development. Consequently, our working capital may not be sufficient and our operating costs may exceed those experienced in our prior years. Therefore, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced net losses, has a working capital deficit and sustained cash outflows from operating activities and had to raise capital to sustain operations. There is no assurance that the Company's developmental and marketing efforts will be successful, that the Company will ever have commercially accepted products, or that the Company will achieve significant revenues.

As a result of the above, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. There is substantial doubt about the entities ability to continue for a period of 12 months. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Controls and Procedures

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

15 

The Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial (and principal accounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016.  Based upon that evaluation and the identification of the material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as described below, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the Company. Management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the 2013 criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles because of the Company's limited resources, lack of qualified accounting personnel and limited number of employees. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and accounting professionals.  As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
