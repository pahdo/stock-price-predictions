FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF TOPEKA 
  Notes to Financial Statements     - Unaudited 
  September 30, 2016 

NOTE   1       BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

Basis of Presentation:   The accompanying interim financial statements of the FHLBank are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instruction provided by Article 10, Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. The financial statements contain all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the FHLBank s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other interim period. 
    
  The FHLBank s significant accounting policies and certain other disclosures are set forth in the notes to the audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The interim financial statements presented herein should be read in conjunction with the FHLBank s audited financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the FHLBank s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on   March 10, 2016   (annual report on Form 10-K). The notes to the interim financial statements highlight significant changes to the notes included in the annual report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Use of Estimates  : The preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements in determining the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and estimated fair values and in determining the disclosure of any contingent assets or liabilities. Estimates and assumptions by management also affect the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates include the fair value of trading and available-for-sale securities, the fair value of derivatives and the allowance for credit losses. Many of the estimates and assumptions, including those used in financial models, are based on financial market conditions as of the date of the financial statements. Because of the volatility of the financial markets, as well as other factors that affect management estimates, actual results may vary from these estimates. 
    
  Reclassifications:   Certain amounts in the financial statements and related footnotes have been reclassified to conform to current period presentations. On January 1, 2016, the FHLBank adopted the guidance,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in April 2015. This guidance requires a retrospective reclassification of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability from other assets to a reduction of the carrying amount of the liability consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. As a result, debt issuance costs of $  9,221,000   and $  300,000   on consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes, respectively, were reclassified from other assets to consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2015, resulting in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities. The adoption of this amendment did not have an impact on the FHLBank's results of operations or cash flows. See   Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Interpretations and Changes in and Adoptions of Accounting Principles   for discussion of this guidance. 

NOTE   2       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AND CHANGES IN AND ADOPTIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES    
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   In August 2016, FASB issued amendments to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for the FHLBank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the FHLBank's statement of cash flows. 
    
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   In June 2016, FASB issued amended guidance for the accounting of credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments require entities to measure expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. Additionally, under the new guidance, a financial asset, or a group of financial assets, measured at amortized cost basis is required to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. 

13 

The guidance also requires: 
             
    The statement of income to reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period; 
                
    The entities to determine the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination that are measured at amortized cost basis in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis. The initial allowance for credit losses is required to be added to the purchase price; 
                
    Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments limit the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost; and 
                
    Public entities to further disaggregate the current disclosure of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables by the year of origination (i.e., vintage). 
       
  The guidance is effective for the FHLBank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2020. Early application is permitted as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance should be applied using a modified-retrospective approach, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. In addition, entities are required to use a prospective transition approach for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) had been recognized before the effective date. The FHLBank is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.   In March 2016, FASB issued amendments to resolve current diversity in practice by clarifying the steps required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative. The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, which is January 1, 2017 for the FHLBank. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance is not expected to affect the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.   In March 2016, FASB issued amendments to clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under GAAP does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The FHLBank elected to early adopt the guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the FHLBank s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Leases.   In February 2016, FASB issued amendments to lease accounting guidance. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases in the statement of financial condition, which effectively removes a source of off-balance sheet financing for operating leases. A distinction remains between finance leases and operating leases, but the assets and liabilities arising from operating leases are now also required to be recognized in the statement of financial condition. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, which is January 1, 2019 for the FHLBank. The FHLBank is currently evaluating these amendments to determine the impact, if any, on the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   In January 2016, FASB issued amendments to improve the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments through changes to existing GAAP. The provisions impacting the FHLBank include the elimination of the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost, the requirement to use the notion of exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, and the separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the statement of financial condition or in the notes to financial statements. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is January 1, 2018 for the FHLBank. The FHLBank is currently evaluating these amendments to determine the impact, if any, on the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.     I  n April 2015, FASB issued amendments to clarify the accounting for cloud computing arrangements. The amendments provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and how to account for it. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, which was January 1, 2016 for the FHLBank. The FHLBank elected to adopt the amendments prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   In April 2015, FASB issued guidance that requires a reclassification of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability from other assets to a reduction of the carrying amount of the liability consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs did not change as a result of this amendment. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, which was January 1, 2016 for the FHLBank. The period-specific effects as a result of applying this guidance are required to be adjusted retrospectively to each individual period presented on the statement of condition.     The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   In February 2015,     FASB issued guidance that impacts reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they must consolidate certain legal entities. Under the amended guidance, in a consolidation evaluation, more emphasis is placed on variable interests other than fee arrangements, such as principal investment risk or guarantees of the value of the assets or liabilities of the variable interest entity. The amendments emphasize risk of loss in the determination of a controlling financial interest and provide a scope exception for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investments Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, which was January 1, 2016 for the FHLBank. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the FHLBank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Revenue Recognition.   In May 2014, FASB issued guidance to introduce a new revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, FASB voted to defer the effective date of the new standard by one year. In     addition, in March 2016, FASB issued amendments to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, in particular, relating to how an entity should determine whether the entity is a principal or an agent for each specified good or service promised to the customer and the nature of each specified good or service. The amendments do not change the core principle in the new revenue standard. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the FHLBank), including interim periods within that reporting period. The FHLBank is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have, if any, on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but any effect is not expected to be material.

The amortized cost, carrying value and fair values of held-to-maturity securities by contractual maturity as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   are shown in Table   3.11   (in thousands). Expected maturities of certain securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees. 
    
  Table   3.11 

Table   3.12   details interest rate payment terms for the amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   3.12 

Other-than-temporary Impairment:   For the   21   outstanding private-label securities with OTTI during the lives of the securities, the FHLBank s reported balances as of   September 30, 2016   are presented in Table   3.13   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   3.13

Table   3.14   presents a roll-forward of OTTI activity for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   related to credit losses recognized in earnings (in thousands): 
    
  Table   3.14 

2   
    The FHLBank amortizes the credit component based on estimated cash flows prospectively up to the amount of expected principal to be recovered. The discounted cash flows will move from the discounted loss value to the ultimate principal to be written off at the projected date of loss. If the expected cash flows improve, the amount of expected loss decreases which causes a corresponding decrease in the calculated amortization. Based on the level of improvement in the cash flows, the amortization could become a positive adjustment to income.  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of a portion of the FHLBank's available-for-sale and held-to-maturity MBS were below the amortized cost of the securities due to interest rate volatility and/or illiquidity. However, the decline in fair value of these securities is considered temporary as the FHLBank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on the remaining securities in unrecognized loss positions and neither intends to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that the FHLBank will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. For state and local housing agency obligations, the FHLBank determined that all of the gross unrealized losses on these bonds were temporary because the strength of the underlying collateral and credit enhancements was sufficient to protect the FHLBank from losses based on current expectations. 

NOTE   4       ADVANCES    
    
  General Terms:   The FHLBank offers a wide range of fixed and variable rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics and optionality. As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the FHLBank had advances outstanding at interest rates ranging from   0.24   percent to   7.41   percent and   0.22 percent   to   7.41 percent  , respectively. Table   4.1   presents advances summarized by year of contractual maturity as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (dollar amounts in thousands):  
    
  Table   4.1    

21 

The FHLBank s advances outstanding include advances that contain call options that may be exercised with or without prepayment fees at the borrower s discretion on specific dates (call dates) before the stated advance maturities (callable advances). In exchange for receiving the right to call the advance on a predetermined call schedule, the borrower may pay a higher fixed rate for the advance relative to an equivalent maturity, non-callable, fixed rate advance. The borrower normally exercises its call options on these advances when interest rates decline (fixed rate advances) or spreads change (adjustable rate advances). The FHLBank s advances as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   include callable advances totaling   $6,428,029,000   and   $6,326,747,000  , respectively. Of these callable advances, there were   $6,316,072,000   and   $6,213,293,000   of variable rate advances as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Convertible advances allow the FHLBank to convert an advance from one interest payment term structure to another. When issuing convertible advances, the FHLBank purchases put options from a member that allow the FHLBank to convert the fixed rate advance to a variable rate advance at the current market rate or another structure after an agreed-upon lockout period. A convertible advance carries a lower interest rate than a comparable-maturity fixed rate advance without the conversion feature. As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the FHLBank had convertible advances outstanding totaling   $1,286,192,000   and   $1,472,842,000  , respectively. 
    
  Table   4.2   presents advances summarized by contractual maturity or next call date (for callable advances) and by contractual maturity or next conversion date (for convertible advances) as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

NOTE   5       MORTGAGE LOANS    
    
  The MPF Program involves the FHLBank investing in mortgage loans, which have been funded by the FHLBank through or purchased from its participating members. These mortgage loans are government-insured or guaranteed loans (by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture (RHS) and/or the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)) and conventional residential loans credit-enhanced by participating financial institutions (PFIs). Depending upon a member s product selection, the servicing rights can be retained or sold by the participating member. The FHLBank does not buy or own any mortgage servicing rights.

See Note   6   for information related to the FHLBank s credit risk on mortgage loans and allowance for credit losses. 

NOTE   6       ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES    
    
  The FHLBank has established an allowance methodology for each of its portfolio segments: credit products (advances, letters of credit and other extensions of credit to borrowers); government mortgage loans held for portfolio; conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio; the direct financing lease receivable; term Federal funds sold; and term securities purchased under agreements to resell. Based on management's analyses of each portfolio segment, the FHLBank has only established an allowance for credit losses on its conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio.

NOTE   7       DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    

Table   7.1   represents outstanding notional balances and fair values (includes net accrued interest receivable or payable on the derivatives) of the derivatives outstanding by type of derivative and by hedge designation as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   7.1    

28 

The following tables provide information regarding gains and losses on derivatives and hedging activities by type of hedge and type of derivative and gains and losses by hedged item for fair value hedges. 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the FHLBank recorded net gain (loss) on derivatives and hedging activities as presented in Table   7.2   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   7.2    

The FHLBank carries derivative instruments at fair value on its Statements of Condition. Any change in the fair value of derivatives designated under a fair value hedging relationship is recorded each period in current period earnings. Fair value hedge accounting allows for the offsetting fair value of the hedged risk in the hedged item to also be recorded in current period earnings. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the FHLBank recorded net gain (loss) on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair value hedging relationships and the impact of those derivatives on the FHLBank s net interest income as presented in Table   7.3   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   7.3

    The differentials between accruals of interest receivables and payables on derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the amortization/accretion of hedging activities are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the designated underlying hedged item. 

29 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the FHLBank recorded net gain (loss) on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair value hedging relationships and the impact of those derivatives on the FHLBank s net interest income as presented in Table   7.4   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   7.4    

1   
    The differentials between accruals of interest receivables and payables on derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the amortization/accretion of hedging activities are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the designated underlying hedged item. 

Based on credit analyses and collateral requirements, FHLBank management does not anticipate any credit losses on its derivative agreements. The maximum credit risk applicable to a single counterparty was   $114,000   and   $24,670,000   as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. The counterparty was different for each period. 
    
  Certain of the FHLBank s uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the FHLBank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is deterioration in the FHLBank s credit rating. If the FHLBank s credit rating is lowered by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), the FHLBank may be required to deliver additional collateral on uncleared derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivative instruments with derivative counterparties containing credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net derivative liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   was   $64,056,000   and   $36,302,000  , respectively, for which the FHLBank has posted collateral with a fair value of   $26,529,000   and   $6,622,000  , respectively, in the normal course of business. If the FHLBank s credit rating had been lowered one level (e.g., from double-A to single-A), the FHLBank would have been required to deliver an additional   $23,900,000   and   $17,500,000   of collateral to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements and generally, credit ratings are not factored into the initial margin. However, clearing agents may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including but not limited to credit rating downgrades. The FHLBank was not required to post additional initial margin by its clearing agents as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The FHLBank s net exposure on derivative agreements is presented in Note   10  .

The FHLBank s participation in consolidated obligation bonds outstanding as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   includes callable bonds totaling   $5,442,000,000   and   $6,758,500,000  , respectively. The FHLBank uses the unswapped callable bonds for financing its callable fixed rate advances (Note   4  ), MBS (Note   3  ) and mortgage loans (Note   5  ). Contemporaneous with a portion of its fixed rate callable bond issuances, the FHLBank will also enter into interest rate swap agreements (in which the FHLBank generally pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate) with call features that mirror the options in the callable bonds (a sold callable swap). The combined sold callable swap and callable debt transaction allows the FHLBank to obtain attractively priced variable rate financing. Table   9.2   summarizes the FHLBank s participation in consolidated obligation bonds outstanding by year of maturity, or by the next call date for callable bonds as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

NOTE   10       ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO OFFSETTING    
    
  The FHLBank presents certain financial instruments, including derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities purchased under agreements to resell, on a net basis by clearing agent by Clearinghouse, or by counterparty, when it has met the netting requirements. For these financial instruments, the FHLBank has elected to offset its asset and liability positions, as well as cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, received or pledged, and associated accrued interest. 
    
  Tables   10.1   and   10.2   present the fair value of financial assets, including the related collateral received from or pledged to clearing agents or counterparties, based on the terms of the FHLBank s master netting arrangements or similar agreements as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

NOTE   11       CAPITAL    
    
  Capital Requirements:   The FHLBank is subject to   three   capital requirements under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) and the Finance Agency s capital structure regulation. Regulatory capital does not include AOCI but does include mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
             
    Risk-based capital.   The FHLBank must maintain at all times permanent capital in an amount at least equal to the sum of its credit risk, market risk and operations risk capital requirements. The risk-based capital requirements are all calculated in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Finance Agency.     Only permanent capital, defined as Class B Common Stock and retained earnings, can be used by the FHLBank to satisfy its risk-based capital requirement. The Finance Agency may require the FHLBank to maintain a greater amount of permanent capital than is required by the risk-based capital requirement as defined, but the Finance Agency has not placed any such requirement on the FHLBank to date. 
                
    Total regulatory capital.   The GLB Act requires the FHLBank to maintain at all times at least a   4.0 percent   total capital-to-asset ratio. Total regulatory capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital, Class A Common Stock, any general loss allowance, if consistent with GAAP and not established for specific assets, and other amounts from sources determined by the Finance Agency as available to absorb losses. 
                
    Leverage capital.   The FHLBank is required to maintain at all times a leverage capital-to-assets ratio of at least   5.0 percent  , with the leverage capital ratio defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted   1.5   times and non-permanent capital (currently only Class A Common Stock) weighted   1.0   times, divided by total assets. 
       
  Table   11.1   illustrates that the FHLBank was in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 
    
  Table   11.1    

Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock:   The FHLBank is a cooperative whose members and former members own all of the FHLBank s capital stock. Member shares cannot be purchased or sold except between the FHLBank and its members at a price equal to the   $100   per share par value. If a member cancels its written notice of redemption or notice of withdrawal, the FHLBank will reclassify mandatorily redeemable capital stock from a liability to equity. After the reclassification, dividends on the capital stock would no longer be classified as interest expense. 
    
  Table   11.2   presents a roll-forward of mandatorily redeemable capital stock for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   11.2    

35 

Table   11.3   shows the amount of mandatorily redeemable capital stock by contractual year of redemption as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands). The year of redemption in Table   11.3   is the end of the redemption period in accordance with the FHLBank s capital plan. The FHLBank is not required to redeem or repurchase membership stock until   six months   (for Class A Common Stock) or   five years   (for Class B Common Stock) after the FHLBank receives notice for withdrawal. Additionally, the FHLBank is not required to redeem or repurchase activity-based stock until any activity-based stock becomes excess stock as a result of an activity no longer remaining outstanding. However, the FHLBank intends to repurchase the excess activity-based stock of non-members to the extent that it can do so and still meet its regulatory capital requirements. 
    
  Table   11.3    

1   
    Represents mandatorily redeemable capital stock that is past the end of the contractual redemption period because there is activity outstanding to which the mandatorily redeemable capital stock relates. 

Excess Capital Stock:   Excess capital stock is defined as the amount of stock held by a member (or former member) in excess of that institution s minimum stock purchase requirement. Finance Agency rules limit the ability of the FHLBank to create excess member stock under certain circumstances. For example, the FHLBank may not pay dividends in the form of capital stock or issue new excess stock to members if the FHLBank s excess stock exceeds   one percent   of its total assets or if the issuance of excess stock would cause the FHLBank s excess stock to exceed one percent of its total assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the FHLBank s excess stock was less than   one percent   of total assets. 
    
  Capital Classification Determination:     The Finance Agency implemented the prompt corrective action (PCA) provisions of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The rule established four capital classifications (i.e., adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) for FHLBanks and implemented the PCA provisions that apply to FHLBanks that are not deemed to be adequately capitalized. The Finance Agency determines each FHLBank s capital classification on at least a quarterly basis. If an FHLBank is determined to be other than adequately capitalized, the FHLBank becomes subject to additional supervisory authority by the Finance Agency. Before implementing a reclassification, the Director of the Finance Agency is required to provide the FHLBank with written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to submit a response. As of the most recent review by the Finance Agency for the   second quarter of 2016  , the FHLBank has been classified as   adequately capitalized  .

NOTE   13       FAIR VALUES    
    
  The fair value amounts recorded on the Statements of Condition and presented in the note disclosures have been determined by the FHLBank using available market and other pertinent information and reflect the FHLBank s best judgment of appropriate valuation methods. Although the FHLBank uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any valuation technique. Therefore, the fair values may not be indicative of the amounts that would have been realized in market transactions as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . 

38 

Subjectivity of Estimates:   Estimates of the fair value of advances with options, mortgage instruments, derivatives with embedded options and consolidated obligation bonds with options are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest rate volatility, methods to determine possible distributions of future interest rates used to value options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value estimates. 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy:   The FHLBank records trading securities, available-for-sale securities, derivative assets and derivative liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis and on occasion, certain private-label MBS, impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio and non-financial assets on a non-recurring basis. The fair value hierarchy requires the FHLBank to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair value measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of the market observability of the fair value measurement for the asset or liability. The FHLBank must disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified for all assets and liabilities. 
    
  The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
             
    Level 1 Inputs   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the FHLBank can access on the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2 Inputs   Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
                
    Level 3 Inputs   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
       
  The FHLBank reviews its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain assets or liabilities. There were no reclassifications of assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  

39 

The carrying value and fair value of the FHLBank s financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   are summarized in Tables   13.1   and   13.2   (in thousands). These values do not represent an estimate of the overall market value of the FHLBank as a going concern, which would take into account future business opportunities and the net profitability of assets and liabilities.

Table   13.2    

Fair Value Measurements:   Tables   13.3   and   13.4   present, for each hierarchy level, the FHLBank s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis on the Statements of Condition as of or for the periods ended   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands). The FHLBank measures certain held-to-maturity securities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to the recognition of a credit loss. For held-to-maturity securities that had credit impairment recorded during a period for which no total impairment was recorded (the full amount of additional credit impairment was a reclassification from non-credit impairment previously recorded in AOCI), these securities were recorded at their carrying values and not fair value. The FHLBank measures certain impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when, upon individual evaluation for impairment, the estimated fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount. REO is measured at fair value when the asset s fair value less costs to sell is lower than its carrying amount.

NOTE   14       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
    
  Joint and Several Liability:     As provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (Bank Act) or Finance Agency regulation, consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. FHLBank Topeka is jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all of the consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBanks.   The par amounts for which FHLBank Topeka is jointly and severally liable were approximately   $923,864,739,000   and   $863,556,912,000   as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Off-balance Sheet Commitments:   As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , off-balance sheet commitments are presented in Table   14.1   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   14.1    

Commitments to Extend Credit:   Standby letters of credit are executed for members for a fee. A standby letter of credit is a short-term financing arrangement between the FHLBank and its member or non-member housing associate. If the FHLBank is required to make payment for a beneficiary s draw, these amounts are converted into a collateralized advance to the member. As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding standby letters of credit had original terms of   3   days to   10   years with a final expiration in   2020  . As of   December 31, 2015  , outstanding standby letters of credit had original terms of   6   days to   10   years with a final expiration in   2020  . Unearned fees as well as the value of the guarantees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in other liabilities and amounted to   $1,083,000   and   $1,078,000   as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. Standby letters of credit are fully collateralized with assets allowed by the FHLBank s Member Products Policy (MPP). Advance commitments legally bind and unconditionally obligate the FHLBank for additional advances up to   24   months in the future. Based upon management s credit analysis of members and collateral requirements under the MPP, the FHLBank does not expect to incur any credit losses on the outstanding letters of credit or advance commitments. 
    
  Standby Bond-Purchase Agreements:   The FHLBank has entered into standby bond purchase agreements with state housing authorities whereby the FHLBank, for a fee, agrees to purchase and hold the authorities  bonds until the designated marketing agent can find a suitable investor or the housing authority repurchases the bond according to a schedule established by the standby agreement. Each standby agreement dictates the specific terms that would require the FHLBank to purchase the bond. The bond purchase commitments entered into by the FHLBank expire no later than   2020  , though some are renewable at the option of the FHLBank. As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the total commitments for bond purchases were with   two   in-district and   one   out-of-district state housing authorities as well as   one   participation interest in a standby bond purchase agreement between another FHLBank and a state housing authority in its district. The FHLBank was not required to purchase any bonds under any agreements during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  Commitments to Purchase Mortgage Loans:   These commitments that unconditionally obligate the FHLBank to purchase mortgage loans from participating FHLBank Topeka members in the MPF Program are generally for periods not to exceed   60   calendar days. Certain commitments are recorded as derivatives at their fair values on the Statements of Condition. The FHLBank recorded mortgage delivery commitment net derivative asset (liability) balances of   $339,000   and   $7,000   as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Commitments to Issue Consolidated Obligations:   The FHLBank enters into commitments to issue consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes outstanding in the normal course of its business. All settle within the shortest period possible and are considered regular way trades; thus, the commitments are appropriately not recorded as derivatives. 

44 

NOTE   15       TRANSACTIONS WITH STOCKHOLDERS    
    
  The FHLBank is a cooperative whose members own the capital stock of the FHLBank and generally receive dividends on their investments. In addition, certain former members that still have outstanding transactions are also required to maintain their investments in FHLBank capital stock until the transactions mature or are paid off. Nearly all outstanding advances are with current members, and the majority of outstanding mortgage loans held for portfolio were purchased from current or former members. The FHLBank also maintains demand deposit accounts for members primarily to facilitate settlement activities that are directly related to advances and mortgage loan purchases. 

Transactions with members are entered into in the ordinary course of business. In instances where members also have officers or directors who are directors of the FHLBank, transactions with those members are subject to the same eligibility and credit criteria, as well as the same terms and conditions, as other transactions with members. For financial reporting and disclosure purposes, the FHLBank defines related parties as FHLBank directors  financial institutions and members with capital stock investments in excess of 10 percent of the FHLBank s total regulatory capital stock outstanding, which includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
    
  Activity with Members that Exceed a 10 Percent Ownership in FHLBank Capital Stock:   Tables   15.1   and   15.2   present information as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   on members that owned more than 10 percent of outstanding FHLBank regulatory capital stock in   2016   or   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands). None of the officers or directors of these members currently serve on the FHLBank s board of directors.

Executive Level Overview 
  We are a regional wholesale bank that makes advances (loans) to, purchases mortgage loans from, and provides limited other financial services to our members. The FHLBanks, together with the Office of Finance, a joint office of the FHLBanks, make up the FHLBank System, which consists of   11   district FHLBanks. As independent, member-owned cooperatives, the FHLBanks seek to maintain a balance between their public purpose and their ability to provide adequate returns on the capital supplied by their members. The FHLBanks are supervised and regulated by the Finance Agency, an independent agency in the executive branch of the U.S. government. The Finance Agency s mission is to ensure that the housing GSEs operate in a safe and sound manner so that they serve as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment. 
    
  Our primary funding source is consolidated obligations issued through the FHLBanks  Office of Finance that facilitates the issuance and servicing of the consolidated obligations. The Finance Agency and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury oversee the issuance of FHLBank debt through the Office of Finance. Consolidated obligations are debt instruments that constitute the joint and several obligations of all FHLBanks. Although consolidated obligations are not obligations of, nor guaranteed by, the U.S. government, the capital markets have traditionally viewed the FHLBanks  consolidated obligations as  Federal agency  debt. As a result, the FHLBanks have historically had ready access to funding at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasuries. Additional funds are provided by deposits (received from both member and non-member financial institutions), other borrowings, and the issuance of capital stock. 
    
  We serve eligible financial institutions in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma (collectively, the Tenth District of the FHLBank System). Initially, a member is required to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock based on the member s total assets subject to a per member cap of $500 thousand. Each member may be required to purchase activity-based capital stock (Class B Common Stock) as it engages in certain business activities with the FHLBank, including advances, standby letters of credit, and Acquired Member Assets (AMA), at levels determined by management with the Board of Director s approval and within the ranges stipulated in the Capital Stock Plan. Currently, our capital increases when members are required to purchase additional capital stock in the form of Class B Common Stock to support an increase in their advance borrowings. In the past, capital stock also increased when members sold additional mortgage loans to us; however, members are no longer required to purchase capital stock for AMA activity, as the mortgage loans are supported by the retained earnings of the FHLBank (former members previously required to purchase AMA activity-based stock are subject to the prior requirement as long as there are unpaid principal balances outstanding). At our discretion, we may repurchase excess stock if there is a decline in a member s advances. We believe it is important to manage our business and the associated risks so that we strive to provide franchise value by maintaining a core mission asset focus and meeting the following objectives: (1) achieve our liquidity, housing finance and community development missions by meeting member credit needs by offering advances, supporting residential mortgage lending through the MPF Program and through other products; (2) periodically repurchase excess capital stock in order to appropriately manage the size of our balance sheet; and (3) pay stable dividends.

Net income   increased     $33.2 million  , or   221.4 percent  , to   $48.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $15.0 million   for the same period in the prior year. Net income   increased     $47.7 million  , or   65.6   percent, to   $120.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $72.7 million   for the same period in the prior year. The   increase  s in net income were largely a result of fair value fluctuations on derivatives and hedging activities and trading securities compared to the prior year periods, combined with an   increase   in net interest income of   $1.4 million  , or   2.3 percent  , and   $16.7 million  , or   9.5   percent, for the three- and nine-month periods, respectively. The increases in net interest income when compared to the same periods in 2015 were largely a result of advance growth, increases in higher-yielding investments, and higher average rates on short-term investments, partially offset by an increase in average funding cost driven by increases in short-term interest rates and widening in our debt spreads relative to LIBOR that began towards the end of 2015 and persisted throughout the first half of 2016. Detailed discussion relating to the fluctuations in net interest income can be found under this Item   2        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations  .  
    
  Total assets   increased   $2.4 billion  , or   5.4 percent  , from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was due to a $3.1 billion, or 13.3 percent, increase in advances, mostly in our line of credit advance product. This growth is largely attributed to the increase in dividend rates on our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock that went into effect in 2014 (discussed below), which effectively reduces the cost of our advances to our members and increases our members' ability to profitably deploy the funding. Changes in interest rates could reduce the benefit of these short-term advances to our members, which could cause a significant decline in advances. Cash and short-term investments decreased $1.9 billion from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 as a result of a higher amount of advance repayments at the end of the year compared to the amount of advance repayments received at September 30, 2016, and shifting short-term investments into long-term investment securities. The balance of long-term investment securities increased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. 
    
  Total liabilities   increase  d   $2.2 billion  , or   5.2 percent  , from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was due to a $  3.7 billion     increase   in consolidated obligation discount notes partially offset by a   $1.5 billion   decrease in consolidated obligation bonds. Our funding mix generally is driven by asset composition, but since year-end we have also shifted our debt composition to a higher percentage of lower-cost discount notes as a result of market conditions that increased the cost of consolidated obligations swapped or indexed to LIBOR. During the third quarter of 2016, the spread to LIBOR began to improve and as a result we increased our allocation of floating rate consolidated obligation bonds and decreased our allocation of discount notes in an effort to reduce our LIBOR basis risk. For additional information, see Item   2        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition  .  
    
  Return on average equity (ROE) was   8.69   percent and   2.91   percent for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   7.43   percent and   5.08   percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Despite the increase in average capital caused by the increase in advances, the increase in net income resulted in an increase in ROE for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods. 
    
  Dividends paid to members totaled   $59.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $49.8 million   for the same period in the prior year. The dividend rate for Class A Common Stock remained at 1.00 percent and the dividend rate for Class B Common Stock has remained at 6.00 percent since the third quarter of 2014. Differences in the weighted average dividend rates between the last five quarters are due to the difference in the mix of outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock between those periods. Other factors impacting the outstanding stock class mix and, therefore, the average dividend rates include weekly exchanges of excess Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock and periodic repurchases of excess Class A Common Stock (see    Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital        under this Item   2  ).  
    
  Finance Agency guidance requires that our strategic business plan describes how our business activities will achieve our mission consistent with the Finance Agency s core mission asset guidance. We intend to manage our balance sheet with an emphasis towards maintaining a core mission assets ratio within the range of 70 to 80 percent during 2016. Our ratio of average advances and average mortgage loans to average consolidated obligations based on par balances (core mission assets ratio) was   79   percent for the first nine months of 2016. However, because this ratio is dependent on several variables such as member demand for our advance and mortgage loan products, it is possible that we will be unable to maintain the core mission assets ratio at this level indefinitely.

Financial Market Trends 
  The primary external factors that affect net interest income are market interest rates and the general state of the economy. 
    
  General discussion of the level of market interest rates: 
  Table   2   presents selected market interest rates as of the dates or for the periods shown. 
    
  Table   2

               2   
    Mortgage Bankers Association weekly 30-year fixed rate mortgage contract rate obtained from Bloomberg. 
       
  During the first nine months of 2016, the cost of FHLBank consolidated obligations as measured by the spread to comparative U.S. Treasury rates remained relatively stable; however, the cost of consolidated obligations swapped or indexed to LIBOR during the first half of the year was elevated due to the deterioration of the spread to three-month LIBOR as a result of actions taken by foreign central banks to support their currencies and also due to heavy issuance of term corporate debt that is swapped to LIBOR. Spreads improved during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of an increase in LIBOR rates and increased demand for consolidated obligations largely attributed to money market fund reforms. At the end of 2015, the FOMC raised the target rate for overnight Federal funds for the first time in nearly a decade and emphasized a potential plan to raise rates gradually for the next three years. Based on general market expectations, there is an increased likelihood of the FOMC increasing the target rate in December 2016. The FOMC concluded the asset purchase program in October 2014 but is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of GSE debt and GSE MBS and of rolling over maturing U.S. Treasury securities at auction. The rates on U.S. Treasuries and GSE MBS are likely to increase once the Federal Reserve is no longer reinvesting those principal payments. We issue debt at a spread above U.S. Treasury securities, so higher interest rates increase the cost of issuing FHLBank consolidated obligations and increase the cost of advances to our members and housing associates. For further discussion, see this Item   2      Financial Condition   Consolidated Obligations.  
    
  Other factors impacting FHLBank consolidated obligations: 
  Investors continue to view FHLBank consolidated obligations as carrying a relatively strong credit profile. Historically, our strong credit profile has resulted in steady investor demand for FHLBank discount notes and short-term bonds. Recent regulatory changes to money market funds has intensified demand for our debt. This has allowed the overall cost to issue short-term consolidated obligations to remain relatively low throughout 2016, especially during the third quarter. Several market events continue to have the potential to impact the demand for our consolidated obligations including geopolitical events and/or disruptions; the upcoming presidential election and a pending Congressional budget agreement; changes in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve as the FOMC contemplates increasing short-term interest rates; and a decline in dealer demand due to regulatory changes related to capital.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures. Several of our accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others in terms of their importance to results. These assumptions and assessments include the following: 
             
    Accounting related to derivatives and hedging activities; 
                
    Fair value determinations; 
                
    Accounting for deferred premium/discount associated with MBS; and 
                
    Determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. 
       
  Changes in any of the estimates and assumptions underlying critical accounting policies could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

The accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are described under Item   7        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    in our annual report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference herein. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

Net income   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $48.2 million   compared to   $15.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $120.4 million   compared to   $72.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase  s in net income for both periods were largely a result of fair value fluctuations on derivatives and hedging activities and trading securities compared to the prior year periods (for further discussion see Item 2    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Net Gain(Loss) on Derivatives and Hedging Activities"), combined with an   increase   in net interest income of   $1.4 million  , or   2.3 percent  , and   $16.7 million  , or   9.5   percent, for the three- and nine-month periods, respectively.  
    
  ROE was   8.69 percent   and   2.91 percent   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and   7.43 percent   and   5.08 percent   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. Despite the increase in average capital, the increase in net income resulted in an increase in ROE for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods. 
    
  Net Interest Income:   Net interest income, which includes interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments less interest paid on consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings is the primary source of our earnings. Net interest income   increase  d   $1.4 million   for the   quarter ended September 30, 2016   and   $16.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods. The increase in net interest income for both periods was due to   $2.0 billion   and   $4.4 billion   increases in the average balance of advances for the three- and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the prior year periods (see Tables   5   and   7  ) along with an overall increase in the average yield of advances as a result of an increase in short-term interest rates. The increase in net interest income for the same periods was also a result of recent purchases of higher-yielding investment securities and increases in the average balances and yields of short-term investments, partially offset by an increase in average funding cost driven by increases in short-term interest rates and widening in our debt spreads relative to LIBOR from the end of 2015 through the first half of 2016. Funding spreads improved during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of increased demand for consolidated obligations largely attributed to money market fund reform. A decrease in interest rates provided opportunities to call higher priced debt during the second and third quarters. Despite the increase in net interest income, our net interest margin has declined slightly for both the three- and nine-month periods due to: (1) asset growth in lower-spread advance products; and (2) reduced asset concentration and declining yields in our highest-yielding asset, our mortgage loan portfolio. The mortgage loan portfolio has declined as a percentage of interest-earning assets primarily as a result of growth in advances and other assets, and has experienced declining yields due to prepayments and the related premium amortization combined with new mortgage volume at lower interest rates.  
    
  The average yield on investments, which consists of interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements, and investment securities increased three basis points, from   1.08 percent   to   1.11   percent for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The average yield on investments increased 22 basis points, from 0.96 percent to 1.18 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The increase in yields for both periods was a result of compositional changes in the portfolio combined with increasing yields on individual portfolios, with the exception of the decrease of 11 basis points in the average yield on investment securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016, largely caused by maturities of securities with yields higher than that of the remaining portfolio during the third quarter of 2016. The average yield on investment securities increased 17 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, largely as a result of purchases of higher-yielding fixed rate multi-family GSE MBS.  

52 

The average yield on advances increased 26 basis points, from   0.52   percent for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   0.78   percent for the current quarter. The average yield on advances increased 21 basis points, from   0.55 percent   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   0.76 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in the average yield on advances was due to an increase in short-term interest rates. The average balance of advances   increase  d   $2.0 billion  , or   7.3 percent   from the   third   quarter of   2015   to the third quarter of   2016  . The average balance of advances   increase  d   $4.4 billion  , or   17.3 percent   from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to the same period of   2016  . Average advances have increased since 2014 due to the increase in our Class B Common Stock dividend and member awareness of the benefit of that dividend on the effective borrowing cost of short-term advances. 
    
  The average yield on mortgage loans decreased 11 basis points, from   3.17   percent for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   3.06   percent for the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  . The average yield on mortgage loans decreased seven basis points, from   3.25 percent   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   3.18 percent   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The decrease is a result of downward repricing of the portfolio as prepayments of higher-coupon loans have remained fairly steady since the first quarter of 2015, along with the related premium acceleration (yields on mortgage loans decline as premiums are amortized; amortization accelerates as prepayments increase), combined with purchases of mortgage loans at lower rates. Mortgage rates are not expected to increase substantially in 2016, so premium amortization is likely to remain near current levels, although prepayments tend to slow down during periods of relatively stable rates, as borrowers who are able to refinance their mortgages have already done so.  
    
  The average cost of consolidated obligation bonds increased 36 basis points, from   0.94   percent for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   1.30   percent for the current quarter, and the average cost of discount notes increased 25 basis points over the same period, from 0.10 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 0.35 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The average cost of consolidated obligation bonds increased 33 basis points between periods, from 0.97 percent for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   to 1.30 percent for the current nine month period, and the average cost of discount notes increased 25 basis points over the same period, from 0.09 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 0.34 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in the average cost of consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes was a result of the increase in short-term interest rates between periods and the widening of spreads that occurred at the end of 2015 and persisted throughout the first half of 2016. Spreads improved during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of an increase in demand for our debt, as recently enacted money market fund regulations have prompted a shift from prime funds to government funds. Due to a decrease in interest rates during the second and third quarters of 2016, we were able to replace some maturing and unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds at a lower cost, which partially offset some of the increase in the average cost. Replacing callable debt generally increases interest costs in the short term due to the acceleration of the unamortized concessions on the debt when it is called because concession costs are amortized to contractual maturity. However, this increase is offset by the lower rate on the new debt and the funding benefit due to the timing differences between the date the debt is called and the forward settlement date of the new debt (conventionally not exceeding 30 days). 
    
  The average balance of discount notes increased by $8.0 billion, or 38.3 percent, and $8.7 billion, or 45.3 percent between the three- and nine-month periods, respectively, ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods. Average bond balances declined by $4.7 billion, or 21.5 percent, and $3.1 billion, or 15.1 percent, over the same periods, respectively. Our funding mix generally is driven by asset composition, but we have also shifted our debt composition to a higher percentage of lower-cost discount notes as a result of market conditions that increased the cost of consolidated obligations swapped or indexed to LIBOR. During the third quarter of 2016, the spread to LIBOR began to improve so we increased our allocation of floating rate consolidated obligation bonds and decreased our allocation of discount notes in an effort to reduce our LIBOR basis risk. For further discussion of how we use discount notes and bonds, see Item   2        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition   Consolidated Obligations  .  
    
  Our net interest spread is also impacted by derivative and hedging activities, as the assets and liabilities hedged with derivative instruments designated under fair value hedging relationships are adjusted for changes in fair values, while other assets and liabilities are carried at historical cost. Further, net interest payments or receipts on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges and the amortization/accretion of hedging activities are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the hedged asset or liability. However, net interest payments or receipts on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (economic hedges) flow through net gain (loss) on derivatives and hedging activities instead of net interest income (net interest received/paid on economic derivatives is identified in Tables   9     through     12   under this Item   2  ), which distorts yields, especially for trading investments that are swapped to a variable rate.

Net Gain (Loss) on Derivatives and Hedging Activities:   The volatility in other income (loss) is driven predominantly by net gains (losses) on derivative and hedging transactions, which include interest rate swaps, caps and floors. Net gain (loss) from derivatives and hedging activities is sensitive to several factors, including: (1) the general level of interest rates; (2) the shape of the term structure of interest rates; and (3) implied volatilities of interest rates. The fair value of options, particularly interest rate caps and floors, are also impacted by the time value decay that occurs as the options approach maturity, but this factor represents the normal amortization of the cost of these options and flows through income irrespective of any changes in the other factors impacting the fair value of the options (level of rates, shape of curve, and implied volatility).

Table   11

Table   12    

As reflected in Tables   9     through     12  , the majority of the derivative net unrealized gains and losses are related to economic hedges, such as interest rate swaps matched to GSE debentures or MBS classified as trading securities and interest rate caps and floors, which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. Net interest payments or receipts on these economic hedges flow through net gain (loss) on derivatives and hedging activities instead of net interest income, which distorts yields, especially for trading investments that are swapped to variable rates. Ineffectiveness on fair value hedges contributes to unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, but to a much lesser degree. In the past, we generally recorded net unrealized gains on derivatives when the overall level of interest rates would rise over the period and recorded net unrealized losses when the overall level of interest rates would fall over the period, due to the mix of the economic hedges. However, the mix of our economic hedges changed in mid-2015, so the general level of interest rates will no longer be the primary factor impacting the net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives. Net unrealized gains or losses on derivatives will continue to be a function of the general level of LIBOR swap rates and the spread between the LIBOR swap curve and the GSE interest rate curve (interest rates swaps that are economic hedges of GSE debentures held in trading), but will also be affected by the spread between the LIBOR swap curve and mortgage rates (interest rates swaps that are economic hedges of fixed rate GSE MBS held in trading). 

61 

For the   three- and nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2016  , net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and hedging activities increased net income by $59.3 million and decreased net income by $32.9 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Increases in swap spreads towards the end of 2015 and during the first half of 2016 caused fair value decreases for many of our derivatives, but especially interest rate swaps economically hedging multi-family GSE MBS recorded as trading securities. These spreads improved significantly during the third quarter of 2016, resulting in unrealized gains of $6.1 million for the current quarter and a decrease in the magnitude of unrealized losses to $49.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The fair values of the swapped MBS investments increased as a result of a decrease in interest rates, resulting in unrealized gains of $2.1 million and $58.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which are recorded in net gain (loss) on trading securities. All of these multi-family GSE MBS and associated interest rate swaps were purchased or entered into after May 2015 and are expected to create more income statement volatility than the interest rate swaps and related trading GSE debentures due to the relatively long length of the contracts and their relationship with mortgage rates, which tend to be more volatile than rates on GSE debentures. Unrealized gains of $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and unrealized losses of $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were attributable to the fair value changes of our interest rate swaps matched to GSE debentures as a result of the passage of time, as several derivatives approached maturity (reducing the overall loss position of the derivatives), changes in interest rates for their respective maturities (pay fixed rate swap) and increases in three-month LIBOR (receive variable rate swap). These fluctuations were offset by unrealized losses of $6.2 million for the current quarter and unrealized gains of $5.0 million for the current year-to-date period attributable to the swapped GSE debentures, which are recorded in net gain (loss) on trading securities. Tables   13   and   14   present the relationship between the swapped trading securities and the associated interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment by investment type (in thousands):

Net Gain (Loss) on Trading Securities:   All unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are recorded in other income (loss) as net gain (loss) on trading securities; however, only gains and losses relating to trading securities that are related to economic hedges are included in Tables   9     through     12  . Unrealized gains (losses) fluctuate as the fair value of our trading portfolio fluctuates. There are a number of factors that can impact the fair value of a trading security including the movement in interest rates, changes in credit spreads, the passage of time, and changes in price volatility. Table   15   presents the major components of the net gain (loss) on trading securities (in thousands): 
    
  Table   15    

Our trading portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate GSE debentures and fixed rate multi-family GSE MBS, with a small percentage of variable rate GSE debentures and variable rate GSE MBS. In general, the fixed rate securities are related to economic hedges in the form of interest rate swaps that convert fixed rates to variable rates (see Tables   13   and   14     for the association between the gains (losses) on the fixed rate securities and the related economic hedges). The fair values of the GSE debentures are affected by changes in intermediate interest rates (e.g., two-year to four-year rates) and are swapped to three-month LIBOR. The fair values of the multi-family GSE MBS are affected by changes in mortgage rates and the fixed rate securities are swapped to one-month LIBOR. A decrease in intermediate interest rates during the first half of 2016 resulted in additional unrealized gains on the GSE debentures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These gains were partially offset by narrowing in some GSE credit spreads. Intermediate rates increased slightly during the third quarter of 2016 and credit spreads continued to tighten, which resulted in losses on the GSE debentures for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Decreases in mortgage interest rates have resulted in unrealized gains on our fixed rate multi-family GSE MBS. In addition to interest rates and credit spreads, the value of these securities is affected by time decay. The fixed rate GSE debentures possess coupons that are well above current market rates for similar securities and, therefore, are currently valued at substantial premiums. As these securities approach maturity, their prices will converge to par resulting in a decrease in their current premium price (i.e., time decay). Given that the variable rate GSE debentures re-price monthly, they generally account for a very small portion of the net gain (loss) on trading securities unless current market spreads on these variable rate securities diverge from the spreads at the time of our acquisition of the securities. 

Other Expenses:   Operating expenses, which include compensation and benefits and other operating expenses, were $15.5 million and $39.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $13.2 million and $37.2 million for the same periods in the prior year. The largest component of operating expenses, compensation and benefits,   increase  d by   $1.9 million  , or   19.4 percent  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period, and increased   $2.3 million  , or   8.7   percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increases in compensation were due to the hiring of additional employees and an increase in the base salaries of existing employees, with a corresponding increase in incentive compensation. We expect future increases in this expense as we add positions over the next several years, but our pace of hiring is expected to slow.

Non-GAAP Measures:   We fulfill our mission by: (1) providing liquidity to our members through the offering of advances to finance housing, economic development and community lending; (2) supporting residential mortgage lending through the MPF Program and purchases of MBS; and (3) providing regional affordable housing programs that create housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income families. In order to effectively accomplish our mission, we must obtain adequate funding amounts at acceptable interest rate levels. We use derivatives as tools to reduce our funding costs and manage interest rate risk and prepayment risk. We also acquire and classify certain investments as trading securities for liquidity and asset-liability management purposes. Although we manage the risks mentioned and utilize these transactions for asset-liability tools, we do not manage the fluctuations in the fair value of our derivatives or trading securities. We are essentially a  hold-to-maturity  investor and transact derivatives only for hedging purposes, even though some derivative hedging relationships do not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP (referred to as economic hedges) and therefore can add significant volatility to our GAAP net income. 
    
  Adjusted income is a non-GAAP measure used by management to evaluate the quality of our ongoing earnings. We believe that the presentation of adjusted income as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting our underlying results and profitability. By removing volatility created by fair value fluctuations and items such as prepayment fees, we can compare longer-term trends in earnings that might otherwise be indeterminable. 
    
  Although we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures consistently from period to period using appropriate GAAP components, non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. These non-GAAP measures are frequently used by FHLBank s stakeholders in the evaluation of our performance, but they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.  
    
  Adjusted net income increased $2.1 million and $12.2 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year (see Table   16  ). The increase was due to increased adjusted net interest income, which includes the impact of net interest settlements on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, partially offset by increases in other expenses. Tables   16   and   17   present a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted income and GAAP net interest income to adjusted net interest income (in thousands): 
    
  Table   16

Table   18   presents a comparison of adjusted ROE (a non-GAAP financial measure) to the average overnight Federal funds rate, which we use as a key measure of effective utilization and management of members  capital. The slight decrease in adjusted ROE between the comparative periods is mostly a function of increases in average capital as a result of the increase in advances. Adjusted ROE spread for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is calculated as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):

Financial Condition 
   
  Overall:     Total assets   increased   $2.4 billion  , or   5.4 percent  , from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was due primarily to a   $3.1 billion  , or   13.3   percent, increase in advances, mostly in our line of credit advance product. This growth is attributed to the increase in dividend rates (discussed below), which effectively reduces the cost of our advances to our members and increases our members' ability to profitably deploy the funding. We have been actively promoting the impact of our Class B Common Stock dividend on the effective borrowing cost of advances to increase member awareness of the benefit of higher dividends. Changes in interest rates could reduce the benefit of these short-term advances to our members, which could cause a significant decline in advances. Cash and short-term investments decreased $1.9 billion from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 as a result of a higher amount of advance repayments at the end of the year compared to the amount of advance repayments received at September 30, 2016, and shifting short-term investments into long-term investment securities. The balance of long-term investment securities increased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. 
    
  As a percentage of assets at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  , advances and investment securities increased while cash, short-term investments, and mortgage loans decreased. Our mortgage loan portfolio grew slightly but declined as a percentage of assets because of the 13.3 percent growth in advances. In terms of liabilities, the distribution between discount notes and consolidated obligation bonds has shifted as a result of asset composition, but we have also adjusted our debt composition to a higher percentage of lower-cost discount notes as a result of market conditions that have increased the cost of consolidated obligations swapped or indexed to LIBOR. Table   19   presents the percentage concentration of the major components of our Statements of Condition:

  Table   20    

1       Investments also include interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. 

Advances:   Our advance products are developed, as authorized in the Bank Act and in regulations established by the Finance Agency, to meet the specific liquidity and term funding needs of our members. As a wholesale provider of funds, we compete with brokered certificates of deposit and security repurchase agreements. We strive to price our advances relative to our marginal cost of funds while trying to remain competitive with the wholesale funding markets. While there is typically less competition in the long-term maturities, member demand for advances in these maturities has historically been lower than the demand for advances with short- and medium-term maturities. Nonetheless, long-term advances are also priced at relatively low spreads to our cost of funds. 

67 

Table   21   summarizes advances outstanding by product (dollar amounts in thousands): 
    
  Table   21    

Note that an individual advance may be reclassified to a different product type between periods due to the occurrence of a triggering event such as the passing of a call date (i.e., from fixed rate callable advance to regular fixed rate advance) or conversion of an advance (i.e., from fixed rate convertible advance to adjustable rate callable advance). 
    
  Advances are one of the primary ways we fulfill our mission of providing liquidity to our members and constituted the largest component of our balance sheet at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . The   13.3 percent     increase   in advance par value from December 31, 2015 (see Table   21  ) was due to a significant increase in our line of credit product. The increase in our line of credit product was largely a result of efforts to promote the pricing advantages of advances when taking into consideration our dividend rates paid on member capital stock supporting advances. Changes in interest rates could reduce the benefit of these short-term advances to our members, which could cause a significant decline in advances. We expect advances as a percent of total assets to continue to increase as part of our core mission asset focus and continued efforts to promote awareness of the benefits of higher dividends (see  Executive Level Overview      under this Item   2  ), but we cannot predict member demand for our advance products. 

68 

As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  ,   67.5 percent   and   65.9 percent  , respectively, of our members carried outstanding advance balances. The overall demand for our advances can typically be attributed to the demand for loans that our depository members are experiencing in their communities and their ability to fund those loans with deposit growth. It is also influenced by our insurance company members  need for operational liquidity and the ability of both depository and insurance company members to profitably invest advance funding. The growth in advances experienced since the latter half of 2014 is a result of a smaller number of large members increasing short-term advances, including line of credit advances, due to lower effective borrowing costs when considering the increase in the dividend rate on our Class B Common Stock since 2014. Advances with many members could decline or remain flat until greater levels of funding can be reallocated from short-term liquid assets into higher-yielding loans or assets. If members reduce the volume of their advances, we expect to continue our past practice of repurchasing excess capital stock. In addition, when, and if, member advance demand changes, a few larger members could have a significant impact on the amount of total outstanding advances, much like what has occurred since the latter half of 2014. 
    
  Rather than match funding long-term, fixed rate, large dollar advances, we elect to swap a significant portion of large dollar advances with longer maturities to short-term indices (one  or three month LIBOR) to synthetically create adjustable rate advances. When coupled with the volume of our short-term advances, advances that effectively re-price at least every three months represent   88.0 percent   and   84.7 percent   of our total advance portfolio as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Table   22   presents information on our five largest borrowers (dollar amounts in thousands). If the borrower was not one of our top five borrowers for one of the periods presented, the applicable columns are left blank. We have rights to collateral with an estimated fair value in excess of the book value of these advances and, therefore, do not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.

  Table   4   presents the amount of interest income on advances as a percentage of total interest income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

MPF Program:   The MPF Program is considered an attractive secondary mortgage market alternative for our members, especially the smaller institutions in our district. We participate in the MPF Program through the MPF Provider, a division of FHLBank of Chicago. Under the MPF Program, participating members can sell us conventional and government fixed rate, size-conforming, single-family residential mortgage loans. 
    
  The principal amount of new mortgage loans acquired and held on our balance sheet from our PFIs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.9 billion  . These new originations and acquisitions, net of loan payments received, resulted in an   increase   of   2.6 percent   in the outstanding net balance of our mortgage loan portfolio from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Net mortgage loans as a percentage of total assets   decreased   from   14.4 percent   as of   December 31, 2015   to   14.0 percent   as of   September 30, 2016  . Table   4   presents the amount of interest income on mortgage loans held for portfolio as a percentage of total interest income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  The primary factors that may influence future growth in our mortgage loans held for portfolio include: (1) the number of new and delivering PFIs; (2) the mortgage loan origination volume of current PFIs; (3) refinancing activity; (4) the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve; (5) the relative competitiveness of MPF pricing to the prices offered by other buyers of residential mortgage loans; and (6) a PFI's level of excess risk-based capital relative to the required risk-based capital charge associated with the PFI's CE obligations on MPF mortgage loans. In an effort to manage the level of mortgage loans on our books, management has researched and continues to review options including participating loan volume or selling whole loans to other FHLBanks, members or other investors. As described below, we have pursued participations and, although we may determine to sell whole loans from time to time, we have not identified any specific loans to be sold as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Historically, we have used the MPF Xtra product and mortgage loan participations with another FHLBank to effectively restrict the growth in mortgage loans held for portfolio and provide management with adequate means to control the amount of mortgage loan portfolio volume retained on our balance sheet to maintain our desired asset composition. The MPF Xtra product is a structure where our PFIs sell mortgage loans to FHLBank of Chicago and simultaneously to Fannie Mae. We also recently began offering an MPF Government MBS product that similarly allows our PFIs to sell mortgages to FHLBank Chicago that are pooled into Ginnie Mae securities. Both products are intended to enhance our ability to manage mortgage volumes and receive a counterparty fee from FHLBank Chicago based on mortgage volumes sold by our PFIs. While we discontinued our mortgage loan participations with another FHLBank in the first quarter of 2014 because of lower origination volumes with PFIs, we have the authority to offer participation interests in risk sharing MPF loan pools to member institutions, which may further enhance our ability to manage the size of our mortgage loan portfolio in the future. 

70 

The number of approved PFIs was   275   and   279   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we purchased loans from   170   PFIs with no one PFI accounting for more than   5.0 percent   of the total dollar volume purchased. Although there is no guarantee, we anticipate that the number of PFIs delivering loans will increase during the remainder of 2016 as we continue to educate our members about the improved execution and relative ease of use associated with the MPF Program. Table   25   presents the outstanding balances of mortgage loans sold to us, net of participations, from our top five PFIs and the percentage of those loans to total mortgage loans outstanding (dollar amounts in thousands). If the member was not one of our top five PFIs for one of the periods presented, the applicable columns are left blank. 
    
  Table   25    

Two indications of credit quality are scores provided by Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO       ) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. FICO is a widely used credit industry indicator to assess borrower credit quality with scores typically ranging from 300 to 850 with the low end of the scale indicating greater credit risk. The MPF Program requires a minimum FICO score of 620 for all conventional loans. LTV is a primary variable in credit performance. Generally speaking, a higher LTV ratio means greater risk of loss in the event of a default and also means higher loss severity. The weighted average FICO score and LTV recorded at origination for conventional mortgage loans outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   was   750   and   73.8 percent  , respectively. See   Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 1   for additional information regarding credit quality indicators. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio     The decrease in the allowance for credit losses and the decrease in the allowance balance as a percent of UPB as of   September 30, 2016   were primarily attributable to improvements in credit quality during the period, increases in property values, and a decline in the historical loss factor. The historical loss factor decreases as larger losses realized in older periods roll off or are offset by gains in more current periods in the historical average calculation. We believe that policies and procedures are in place to effectively manage the credit risk on mortgage loans held in portfolio. See   Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 1   for a summary of the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans, and delinquency aging and key credit quality indicators for our mortgage loan portfolio. 

Investments:   Investments are used to provide liquidity and primary and secondary market support for the U.S. housing securities market. Total investments   decrease  d   1.6 percent   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   largely due to a decrease in short-term investments due to the influx of cash that often occurs at the end of the year, the majority of which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015. The decrease in short-term investments was partially offset by an increase in MBS and other long-term securities, which coincided with the increase in advances and mortgage loans, as growth in core mission assets allows for growth in non-mission assets while maintaining our desired core mission assets ratio. Consistent with Finance Agency guidance, we define investment quality as a security with adequate financial backings so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. 
    
  Short-term Investments     Short-term investments, which are used to provide funds to meet the credit needs of our members, maintain liquidity, and meet other financial obligations such as debt servicing, consist primarily of reverse repurchase agreements, interest-bearing deposits, overnight Federal funds sold, term Federal funds sold, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. The Bank Act and Finance Agency regulations and guidelines set liquidity requirements for us, and our board of directors has adopted additional liquidity policies. In addition, we maintain a contingency liquidity plan in the event of financial market disruptions. See    Risk Management   Liquidity Risk Management    under this Item   2   for a discussion of our liquidity management. 

71 

Within our portfolio of short-term investments, we face credit risk from unsecured exposures. Our short-term unsecured credit investments have maturities generally ranging between overnight and three months and include the following types: 
             
    Interest-bearing deposits.   Unsecured deposits that earn interest. 
                
    Federal funds sold.   Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions that are made on either an overnight or term basis. 
                
    Commercial paper.   Unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities. 
                
    Certificates of deposit.   Unsecured negotiable promissory notes issued by banks and payable to the bearer at maturity. 
       
  Table   26   presents the carrying value of our unsecured credit exposure with private counterparties by investment type (in thousands). The unsecured investment credit exposure presented may not reflect the average or maximum exposure during the period as the balances presented reflect the balances at period end. 
    
  Table   26

    Excludes unsecured investment credit exposure to U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, instrumentalities, GSEs and supranational entities and does not include related accrued interest. 
       
  We actively monitor our credit exposures and the credit quality of our counterparties, including an assessment of each counterparty s financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support and the current market perceptions of the counterparties. General macro-economic, political and market conditions may also be considered when deciding on unsecured exposure. As a result, we may further limit existing exposures. 

Finance Agency regulations: (1) include limits on the amount of unsecured credit an individual FHLBank may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties; (2) permit us to extend additional unsecured credit for overnight extensions of credit, subject to limitations; and (3) prohibit us from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. For additional information on our management of unsecured credit exposure, see Item   7        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition   Investments    in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all Finance Agency regulations relating to unsecured credit exposure. 

We manage our credit risk by conducting pre-purchase credit due diligence and on-going surveillance described previously and generally investing in unsecured investments of highly-rated counterparties. From time to time, we extend unsecured credit to qualified members by investing in overnight Federal funds issued by them. In general, we treat members as any other market participant. However, since they are members and we have more access to specific financial information about our members, we have a lower capital requirement than for non-members, but members must still meet our credit ratings requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  , all unsecured investments were rated as investment grade based on NRSROs (see Table   30  ). 

72 

Table   27   presents the amount of our unsecured investment credit exposure by remaining contractual maturity and by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty s parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands). We also mitigate the credit risk on investments by generally investing in investments that have short-term maturities. 
    
  Table   27    

1   
    Excludes unsecured investment credit exposure to U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, instrumentalities, GSEs and supranational entities, and does not include related accrued interest. 
       
  Unsecured credit exposure continues to be cautiously placed, with exposure concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Nordic countries. In addition, we anticipate continued future investment in reverse repurchase agreements, which are secured investments, and limiting unsecured exposure, especially to foreign financial institutions, as long as the interest rates are comparable. To enhance our liquidity position, we classify our unsecured short-term investment securities in our trading portfolio, which allows us to sell these securities if necessary. 

Long-term investments     Our long-term investment portfolio consists primarily of GSE debentures, MBS and state housing finance agency securities. Our Risk Management Policy (RMP) restricts the acquisition of investments to highly rated long-term securities. The majority of these long-term securities are GSE MBS, which provide an alternative means to promote liquidity in the mortgage finance markets while providing acceptable returns. GSE debentures are the other significant investment class that we hold in our long-term investment portfolio. The majority of our unsecured GSE debentures are fixed rate bonds, which are swapped from fixed to variable rates. They provide attractive returns, can serve as excellent collateral (e.g., repurchase agreements and net derivatives exposure), and are generally classified as trading securities and carried at fair value, either to enhance our liquidity position, for asset/liability management purposes, or to provide a fair value offset to the gains or losses on the interest rate swaps tied to these securities. The interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting, which results in the net interest payments or receipts on these economic hedges flowing through net gain (loss) on derivatives and hedging activities instead of net interest income. 
    
  According to Finance Agency regulation codified at 12 C.F.R.  1267.3, no additional MBS purchases can be made if the amortized cost of our mortgage securities exceeds 300 percent of our regulatory capital. Further, quarterly increases in holdings of mortgage securities are restricted to no more than 50 percent of regulatory capital. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of our MBS portfolio represented   317 percent   of our regulatory capital; however, we were in compliance with the regulatory limit at the time of each purchase during the current quarter. As of   September 30, 2016  , we held   $0.9 billion   of par value in MBS in our trading portfolio and   $1.1 billion   of par value in MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The majority of the MBS in both portfolios are fixed rate GSE securities, which are swapped from fixed to variable rates. 

Major Security Types     Securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and recorded at carrying value, which is the net total of par, premiums, discounts and credit and non-credit OTTI discounts. We classify certain investments as trading or available-for-sale securities and carry them at fair value. Securities acquired as asset/liability management tools to manage duration risk, which are likely to be sold when the duration risk is no longer present, are classified as trading or available-for-sale securities. Changes in the fair values of investments classified as trading are recorded through other income and original premiums/discounts on these investments are not amortized. We do not actively trade any of these securities with the intent of realizing gains; most often, they are held until maturity or call date.  

73 

Traditionally, if fixed rate securities were hedged with interest rate swaps, we would classify the securities as trading investments so that the changes in fair values of both the derivatives hedging the securities and the hedged securities are recorded in other income. However, during the third quarter of 2015, we began classifying our swapped fixed rate multi-family GSE MBS as available-for-sale and designating the corresponding interest rate swaps as fair value benchmark hedges. See   Note 3 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 1   to this report for additional information on our different investment classifications including what types of securities are held under each classification. The carrying value of our investments is summarized by security type in Table   28   (in thousands). 
    
  Table   28    

74 

The contractual maturities of our investments are summarized by security type in Table   29   (dollar amounts in thousands). Expected maturities of certain securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.

Securities Ratings     Tables   30   and   31   present the carrying value of our investments by rating as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands). The ratings presented are the lowest ratings available for the security or the issuer based on NRSROs, where available. Some counterparties for collateralized overnight borrowing are not rated by an NRSRO because they are not issuers of debt or are otherwise not required to be rated by an NRSRO. We also utilize other credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments including, but not limited to, collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer.

Private-label Mortgage-backed and Asset-backed Securities     The carrying value of our portfolio of private-label MBS is less than one percent of total assets. We classify private-label MBS as prime, Alt-A and subprime based on the originator s classification at the time of origination or based on classification by an NRSRO upon issuance of the MBS.

Almost all of our private-label MBS were securitized prior to 2006, and there are no securities in the portfolio issued after April 2006. As a result of this higher quality, well-seasoned portfolio, we have not experienced significant losses in our private-label MBS portfolio from OTTI.

    Collateral delinquency is based on the sum of loans greater than 60 days delinquent plus loans in foreclosure plus loans in bankruptcy plus REO. 

Deposits:   Total deposits   decreased     $77.3 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Deposit products offered primarily include demand and overnight deposits and short-term certificates of deposit. Demand deposit programs are offered primarily to facilitate customer transactions with us, such as cash flows associated with advances and mortgage loan transactions. Overnight deposits provide an alternative short-term investment option to members. The majority of deposits are in overnight or demand accounts that generally re-price daily based upon a market index such as overnight Federal funds. However, because of the low interest rate environment, we have established a current floor of 5 basis points on demand deposits and 10 basis points on overnight deposits. The level of deposits is driven by member demand for deposit products, which in turn is a function of the liquidity position of members. Factors that influence deposit levels include turnover in member investment and loan portfolios, changes in members  customer deposit balances, changes in members  demand for liquidity and our deposit pricing as compared to other short-term market rates. Declines in the level of deposits could occur if demand for loans at member institutions increases, if members choose to de-leverage their balance sheets, or if decreases in the general level of liquidity of members should occur. Fluctuations in deposits have little impact on our ability to obtain liquidity. We historically have had stable and ready access to the capital markets through consolidated obligations and can replace any reduction in deposits with similarly or even lower priced borrowings. 

78 

Consolidated Obligations:   Consolidated obligations are the joint and several debt obligations of the FHLBanks and consist of bonds and discount notes. Consolidated obligations represent the primary source of liabilities we use to fund advances, mortgage loans and investments. As noted under Item   3        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  ,  we use debt with a variety of maturities and option characteristics to manage our interest rate risk profile. We make use of derivative transactions, executed in conjunction with specific consolidated obligation debt issues, to synthetically structure funding terms and costs. 
    
  Bonds are primarily used to fund longer-term (one year or greater) advances, mortgage loans and investments. To the extent that the bonds are funding variable rate assets, we typically either issue bonds that have variable rates matching the variable rate asset index or utilize an interest rate swap to change the bonds' characteristics in order to match the assets' index. Additionally, we sometimes use fixed rate, variable rate or complex consolidated obligation bonds that are swapped or indexed to LIBOR to fund short-term advances and money market investments or as a liquidity risk management tool. 
    
  Discount notes are primarily used to fund: (1) shorter-term advances or adjustable rate advances with indices and resets based on our short-term cost of funds; and (2) investments with maturities of three months or less. However, we sometimes use discount notes to fund longer-term assets, including fixed rate assets, variable rate assets, assets swapped to synthetically create variable rate assets, and short-term anticipated cash flows generated by longer-term fixed rate assets.  
    
  Total consolidated obligations   increase  d   5.3 percent   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Discount notes   increased   from   52.3 percent   of total outstanding consolidated obligations as of   December 31, 2015   to   58.1 percent   as of   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of the increase in our line of credit product and other short-term advance products, which are generally funded with discount notes, and market conditions that caused an increase in the cost of consolidated obligation bonds indexed or swapped to LIBOR, resulting in our use of discount notes instead of these bonds to fund LIBOR-based assets, especially during the first half of 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, the spread to LIBOR began to improve so we increased our allocation of floating rate bonds funding our LIBOR-based assets, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in discount notes, which will reduce our LIBOR basis risk. We expect to continue funding our short-term advances with discount notes. We were able to replace some maturing and unswapped callable bonds with lower cost bonds during the second and third quarters of 2016. Replacing callable debt generally increases interest costs in the short term due to the acceleration of the unamortized concessions on the debt when it is called because concession costs are amortized to contractual maturity. However, this increase is offset by the lower rate on the new debt and the funding benefit due to the timing differences between the date the debt is called and the forward settlement date of the new debt (conventionally not exceeding 30 days). 
    
  While we currently have stable access to funding markets, future developments could impact the cost of replacing outstanding debt. Some of these include, but are not limited to, a large increase in call volume, significant increases in advance demand, legislative and regulatory changes, geopolitical events, proposals addressing GSEs, derivative and financial market reform, a decline in investor demand for consolidated obligations, further rating agency downgrades of U.S. Treasury obligations that will in turn impact the rating on FHLBank consolidated obligations, and changes in Federal Reserve policies and outlooks. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
   
  Liquidity:   We maintain high levels of liquidity to achieve our mission of serving as an economical funding source for our members and housing associates. As part of fulfilling our mission, we also maintain minimum liquidity requirements in accordance with certain Finance Agency regulations and guidelines and in accordance with policies established by management and the Board of Directors. Our business model enables us to manage the levels of our assets, liabilities, and capital in response to member credit demand, membership composition, and market conditions. As such, assets and liabilities utilized for liquidity purposes can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows as a result of these factors. 
    
  Sources and Uses of Liquidity     A primary source of our liquidity is the issuance of consolidated obligations. The capital markets traditionally have treated FHLBank obligations as U.S. government agency debt. As a result, even though the U.S. government does not guarantee FHLBank debt, we generally have comparatively stable access to funding at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. We are primarily and directly liable for our portion of consolidated obligations (i.e., those obligations issued on our behalf). In addition, we are jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated obligations of all FHLBanks. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, proceeds (net of premiums and discounts) from the issuance of bonds and discount notes were   $14.3 billion   and   $389.0 billion  , respectively, compared to   $11.1 billion   and   $214.4 billion   for the same period in 2015. The large increase between periods reflects the cumulative effect of using a higher allocation of shorter term discount notes, primarily overnight discount notes, during 2016. We generally use short-term discount notes to fund short-term advances and our short-term liquidity portfolio, but we have been funding a larger percentage of our assets with discount notes due to market conditions during the first half of 2016 that increased the cost of consolidated obligation bonds indexed or swapped to LIBOR. Our other sources of liquidity include deposit inflows, repayments of advances and mortgage loans, maturing investments, interest income, Federal Funds purchased, and proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements or the sale of unencumbered assets.  
  
   79 

At September 30, 2016, our short-term liquidity portfolio, which consists of cash and investments with remaining maturities of one year or less and includes term and overnight Federal funds sold, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and reverse repurchase agreements, decreased $2.0 billion, from   $7.4 billion   as of December 31, 2015 to   $5.4 billion   as of September 30, 2016. The decrease was due to a greater influx of cash at the end of the year compared to other quarter ends. The maturities of our short-term investments are structured to provide periodic cash flows to support our ongoing liquidity needs. To enhance our liquidity position, short-term investment securities (i.e., commercial paper and marketable certificates of deposit) are also classified as trading so that they can be readily sold should liquidity be needed immediately. We also maintain a portfolio of GSE debentures and GSE MBS that can be pledged as collateral for financing in the securities repurchase agreement market and are classified as trading to enhance our liquidity position. These debentures were $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion in par value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We held GSE MBS with a par value of $946.1 million and $962.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition to the balance sheet sources of liquidity discussed previously, we have established lines of credit with numerous counterparties in the Federal funds market as well as with the other FHLBanks. Accordingly, we expect to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for the foreseeable future. 
    
  We manage our average capital ratio to remain above our minimum regulatory and RMP requirements so that we have the ability to issue additional consolidated obligations should the need arise. Excess capital capacity ensures we are able to meet the liquidity needs of our members and/or repurchase excess stock either upon the submission of a redemption request by a member or at our discretion for balance sheet or capital management purposes.  
    
  Uses of liquidity primarily include issuing advances, purchasing investments, and repaying called and maturing consolidated obligations for which we are the primary obligor. We also use liquidity to purchase mortgage loans, repay member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, redeem or repurchase capital stock, and pay dividends to members. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, advance disbursements totaled   $106.7 billion   compared to   $76.9 billion   for the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled   $2.1 billion   compared to $  4.5 billion   for the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, payments on consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes were   $15.8 billion   and   $385.3 billion  , respectively, compared to   $9.1 billion   and   $208.0 billion   for the same period in 2015, which includes bonds that were called during the period. The large increase in payments on discount notes between periods primarily reflects the cumulative effect of using a higher allocation of discount notes, including overnight discount notes.  
    
  Liquidity Requirements     We are subject to five metrics for measuring liquidity: statutory, operational, and contingency liquidity, and calendar day guidelines under different scenarios. Statutory liquidity requires us to have an amount equal to current deposits received from members invested in obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, and advances with a final maturity not exceeding five years. Operational liquidity requires that we maintain liquidity in an amount not less than 20 percent of the sum of our demand and overnight deposits and other overnight borrowings, plus 10 percent of the sum of our term deposits, consolidated obligations, and other borrowings that mature within one year. Contingency liquidity is an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for five business days if we are unable to access the capital markets to issue consolidated obligations. Our net liquidity in excess of contingency liquidity over a cumulative five-business-day period was   $4.6 billion   as of September 30, 2016. Contingency plans are in place at the FHLBank and the Office of Finance that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of financial market disruptions, as well as systemic Federal Reserve wire transfer system disruptions. Further, under the Bank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.  
    
  In addition to the liquidity measures described above, we are required by the Finance Agency to meet two daily liquidity standards, each of which assumes that we are unable to access the market for consolidated obligations. The first standard requires us to maintain sufficient funds to meet our obligations for 15 days under a scenario in which it is assumed that members do not renew any maturing advances. The second standard requires us to maintain sufficient funds to meet our obligations for five days under a scenario in which it is assumed that members renew all maturing advances. We remained in compliance with each of these liquidity requirements throughout the first nine months of 2016. See  Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management  under this Item 2 for additional discussion on our liquidity requirements. 

80 

In order to ensure sufficient liquidity, we generally maintain a relatively longer weighted-average maturity on our consolidated obligation discount notes than the weighted average maturity of short-term liquid investment balances. The weighted average remaining days to maturity of discount notes outstanding   increased   to   38   days as of   September 30, 2016   from   37   days at   December 31, 2015  . The weighted average remaining maturity of our money market investment portfolio (Federal funds sold, marketable certificates of deposit, commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements) and non-earning cash left in our Federal Reserve Bank account was   4   days as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   because we held primarily short-term investments with overnight maturities as of those dates. The mismatch of discount notes and our money market investment portfolio   increase  d from   33   days on   December 31, 2015   to   34   days on   September 30, 2016   as a result of the increase in the weighted average remaining days to maturity of our discount notes. Over time, especially as the yield curve steepens on the short end, maintaining the differential between the weighted average original maturity of discount notes and money market investments will increase our cost of funds and reduce our net interest income. 

Capital:   Total capital consists of capital stock, retained earnings, and AOCI. 
    
  Capital stock increased   11.8 percent   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased utilization of advances. Under our capital plan, members must purchase additional activity-based stock as they enter into advance transactions with us. The amount required is subject to change within ranges established under our capital plan.  
    
  Excess stock represents the amount of stock held by a member in excess of that institution s minimum stock requirement. Upon reducing the activity-based stock purchase requirement, through a mandated change or through a reduction of advance balances, excess stock is created since the member no longer needs the same level of activity-based capital stock. If our excess stock exceeds 1.0 percent of our assets before or after the payment of a dividend in the form of stock, we would be prohibited by Finance Agency regulation from paying dividends in the form of stock. To manage the amount of excess stock, we repurchase excess Class A Common Stock over FHLBank-established limits held by any individual member periodically throughout the year. In April 2014, we began the practice of repurchasing all outstanding excess Class A Common Stock, generally on a monthly basis. Our current practice of regular weekly exchanges of all excess Class B Common Stock over $50,000 per member for Class A Common Stock remains in effect.  
    
  Under our cooperatively structured capital plan, our capital stock balances should fluctuate along with any growth (increased capital stock balances) or reduction (decreased capital stock balances) in advance balances in future periods. Any repurchase of excess capital stock is at our discretion and subject to statutory and regulatory limitations, including being in compliance with all of our regulatory capital requirements after any such discretionary repurchase. 

81 

Our activity-based stock purchase requirements are consistent with our cooperative structure; members  stock ownership requirements and the dollar amount of dividends received generally increases as their activities with us increase. To the extent that a member s asset-based stock purchase requirement is insufficient to cover the member s activity-based stock purchase requirement and the member is required to purchase Class B Common Stock, we believe the value of our products and services is enhanced by dividend yields that exceed the return available from other investments with similar terms and credit quality. Factors that affect members  willingness to enter into activity with us and purchase additional required activity-based stock include, but are not limited to, our dividend rates, the risk-based capital weighting of our capital stock and alternative investment opportunities available to our members. Based on anecdotal evidence (such as member advance activity and discussions with members), we believe that our activity-based stock purchase requirement for advances has not reduced advance activity with our members, although that may not hold true in the future. Table   34   provides a summary of member capital requirements under our current capital plan as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 
    
  Table   34    

1   
    Class A Common Stock, up to a member s asset-based stock requirement, will be used to satisfy a member s activity-based stock requirement before any Class B Common Stock is purchased by the member.  
               2   
    Includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock.  
               3   
    Advances to housing associates have no activity-based requirements because housing associates cannot own FHLBank stock.  
               4   
    Non-members are subject to the AMA activity-based stock requirement as long as there are UPBs outstanding, but the requirement is currently zero percent for members.  
       
  We are subject to three capital requirements under provisions of the GLB Act, the Finance Agency s capital structure regulation and our current capital plan, which includes risk-based capital requirement, total capital requirement and leverage capital requirement. We have been in compliance with each of the aforementioned capital rules and requirements at all times since the implementation of our capital plan. See   Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 1   for additional information and compliance as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . 

Capital Distributions:   Dividends may be paid in cash or capital stock as authorized by our Board of Directors. Quarterly dividends can be paid out of current and previous unrestricted retained earnings, subject to Finance Agency regulation and our capital plan. 

Within our capital plan, we have the ability to pay different dividend rates to the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. This differential is implemented through a mechanism referred to as the dividend parity threshold. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock share in dividends equally up to the dividend parity threshold for a dividend period, then the dividend rate for holders of Class B Common Stock can exceed the rate for holders of Class A Common Stock, but the dividend rate on Class A Common Stock can never exceed the dividend rate on Class B Common Stock. In essence, the dividend parity threshold: (1) serves as a soft floor to holders of Class A Common Stock since we must pay holders of Class A Common Stock the dividend parity threshold rate before paying a higher rate to holders of Class B Common Stock; (2) indicates a potential dividend rate to holders of Class A Common Stock so that they can make decisions as to whether or not to hold excess Class A Common Stock; and (3) provides us with a tool to manage the amount of excess stock through higher or lower dividend rates by varying the desirability of holding excess shares of Class A Common Stock (i.e., the lower the dividend rate on Class A Common Stock, the less desirable it is to hold excess Class A Common Stock). 

82 

The current dividend parity threshold is equal to the average effective overnight Federal funds rate for a dividend period minus 100 basis points. This dividend parity threshold was effective for dividends paid for all of   2015   and   2016   and will continue to be effective until such time as it may be changed by our Board of Directors. With the current level of the overnight Federal funds target rate, the dividend parity threshold is effectively floored at zero percent at this time. Under the capital plan, all dividends paid in the form of capital stock must be paid in the form of Class B Common Stock. Table   35   presents the dividend rates per annum paid on capital stock under our capital plan for the periods indicated: 
    
  Table   35    

1   
    Weighted average dividend rates are dividends paid in cash and stock on both classes of stock divided by the average of capital stock eligible for dividends.  

We increased the dividend rate to 6.00 percent on Class B Common Stock in the third quarter of 2014, as a result of a change in our capital management practices intended to result in a higher percentage payout of quarterly earnings, slower growth in retained earnings, and increased advance utilization primarily due to the extremely low all-in cost of advances once the dividend is factored in. We expect to recommend maintaining the current dividend rates on Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock for a considerable time in keeping with the desire to pay out a larger percentage of income than in the past. We caution, however, that market conditions can be unpredictable and adverse changes may result in lower dividend rates in future quarters. While there is no assurance that our Board of Directors will not change the dividend parity threshold in the future, the capital plan requires that we provide members with 90 days' notice prior to the end of a dividend period in which a different dividend parity threshold is utilized in the payment of a dividend. 
    
  We expect to continue paying dividends primarily in the form of capital stock in 2016, but future dividends may be paid in cash. The payment of cash dividends instead of stock dividends should not have a significant impact from a liquidity perspective, as the subsequent redemption of excess stock created by stock dividends would utilize liquidity resources in the same manner as a cash dividend. 

Risk Management 
   
  Active risk management continues to be an essential part of our operations and a key determinant of our ability to maintain earnings to return an acceptable dividend to our members and meet retained earnings thresholds. We maintain an enterprise risk management (ERM) program in an effort to enable the identification of all significant risks to the organization and institute the prompt and effective management of any major risk exposures. Our ERM program is a structured and disciplined approach that aligns strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge with the purpose of identifying, evaluating and managing the uncertainties we face as we create value. It is a continuous process of identifying, prioritizing, assessing and managing inherent enterprise risks (i.e., business, compliance, credit, liquidity, market and operations) before they become realized risk events. See Item   7        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management    in our Form 10-K for more information on our ERM program. A separate discussion of market risk is included under Item   3        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    of this Form 10-Q. 

Credit Risk Management:   Credit risk is defined as the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its financial obligations in accordance with agreed terms. We manage credit risk by following established policies, evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties, and utilizing collateral agreements and settlement netting for derivative transactions where enforceability of the legal right of offset has been determined. The most important step in the management of credit risk is the initial decision to extend credit. Continuous monitoring of counterparties is completed for all areas where we are exposed to credit risk, whether that is through lending, investing or derivative activities. 
    
  Lending and AMA Activities     Credit risk with members arises partly as a result of our lending and AMA activities (members  CE obligations on conventional mortgage loans that we acquire through the MPF Program). We manage our exposure to credit risk on advances, letters of credit, derivatives, and members  CE obligations on conventional mortgage loans through a combined approach that provides ongoing review of the financial condition of our members coupled with prudent collateralization. 

83 

As provided in the Bank Act, a member s investment in our capital stock is held as additional collateral for the member s advances and other credit obligations (letters of credit, CE obligations, etc.). In addition, we can call for additional collateral or substitute collateral during the life of an advance or other credit obligation to protect our security interest. 
    
  Credit risk arising from AMA activities under our MPF Program falls into three categories: (1) the risk of credit losses on the mortgage loans represented in our First Loss Account (FLA) and last loss positions; (2) the risk that a PFI will not perform as promised with respect to its loss position provided through its CE obligations on conventional mortgage loan pools, which are covered by the same collateral arrangements as those described for advances; and (3) the risk that a third-party insurer (obligated under primary mortgage insurance (PMI) or supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI) arrangements) will fail to perform as expected. Should a PMI third-party insurer fail to perform, it would increase our credit risk exposure because our FLA is the next layer to absorb credit losses on conventional mortgage loan pools. Likewise, if an SMI third-party insurer fails to perform, it would increase our credit risk exposure because it would reduce the participating member s CE obligation loss layer since SMI is purchased by PFIs to cover all or a portion of their CE obligation exposure for mortgage pools. Credit risk exposure to third-party insurers to which we have PMI and/or SMI exposure is monitored on a monthly basis and regularly reported to the Board of Directors. We perform credit analysis of third-party PMI and SMI insurers on at least an annual basis. On a monthly basis, we review trends that could identify risks with our mortgage loan portfolio, including low FICO scores and high LTV ratios. Based on the credit underwriting standards under the MPF Program and this monthly review, we have concluded that the mortgage loans we hold would not be considered subprime. 

Investments     Our RMP restricts the acquisition of investments to high-quality, short-term money market instruments and highly rated long-term securities. The short-term investment portfolio represents unsecured credit and reverse repurchase agreements. Therefore, counterparty ratings are monitored daily while performance and capital adequacy are monitored on a monthly basis in an effort to mitigate unsecured credit risk on our short-term investments. Collateral valuation and compliance with collateral eligibility and transaction margin requirements are monitored daily to limit secured credit risk on our reverse repurchase agreements. MBS represent the majority of our long-term investments. We hold MBS issued by Ginnie Mae and GSEs, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) securitized by GSEs, private-label MBS rated triple-A at the time of purchase, and CMOs securitized by whole loans. Approximately   97   percent of our MBS/CMO portfolio is securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. All of our private-label MBS have been downgraded below triple-A subsequent to purchase (see Table   33  ), but the downgraded securities have been and are currently paying according to contractual agreements with the exception of   seven   securities that have experienced immaterial cash flow shortfalls. Other long-term investments include unsecured GSE debentures and unsecured or collateralized state and local housing finance agency securities that were rated at least double-A at the time of purchase. 
    
  Derivatives     We transact most of our derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or with an executing broker and cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent), with a Derivatives Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives). 
    
  We are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures and collateral requirements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. We manage this risk through credit analysis and collateral management. We are also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulation. 
    
  Uncleared Derivatives.   We are subject to non-performance by the counterparties to our uncleared derivative transactions. We generally require collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. For some counterparties, the amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to the counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. For other counterparties, collateral is required on all net unsecured credit exposure. For a counterparty with credit rating thresholds, a counterparty generally must deliver collateral to us if the total market value of our exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. Our credit risk exposure from derivative transactions with member institutions is fully collateralized under our Advance, Pledge and Security Agreement. We had no outstanding derivative transactions with members as of September 30, 2016. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our uncleared derivative transactions as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cleared Derivatives.   We are subject to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse(s) and clearing agent(s). The requirement that we post initial and variation margin, through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes us to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. We do not anticipate any credit losses on our cleared derivatives as of   September 30, 2016  . 

84 

We regularly monitor the exposures on our derivative transactions by determining the market value of positions using internal pricing models. The market values generated by the pricing model used to value derivatives are compared to dealer model results on a monthly basis to ensure that our derivative pricing model is reasonably calibrated to actual market pricing methodologies utilized by the dealers. In addition, we have our internal pricing model validated annually by an independent consultant. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, management does not anticipate any credit losses on our derivative transactions. See   Note 7 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 1   for additional information on managing credit risk on derivatives. 
    
  The contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments. The maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there are defaults, minus the value of any related collateral posted to satisfy the initial margin (if required) and the variation margin. Our derivative transactions are subject to variation margin which is derived from the change in market value of the transaction and must be posted by the net debtor on demand. Cleared transactions are subject to initial margin as well as variation margin. The initial margin is intended to protect the Clearinghouse against default of a clearing agent and to protect the clearing agent against default of a customer. Initial margin is calculated to cover the potential price volatility of the derivative transaction between the time of the default and the assignment of the transaction to another clearing agent or termination of the transaction. Although the initial margin requirement should decrease over time as the duration and market volatility decrease, it remains outstanding for the life of the transaction; thus, it is possible that we could either have: (1) net credit exposure with a Clearinghouse even if our net creditor position has been fully satisfied by the receipt of variation margin; or (2) net credit exposure with a Clearinghouse despite being the net debtor (i.e., being in a liability position). In determining maximum credit risk, we consider accrued interest receivables and payables as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities. 
    
  Tables   36   and   37   present derivative notional amounts and counterparty credit exposure, net of collateral, by whole-letter rating (in the event of a split rating, we use the lowest rating published by Moody's Investor Service or Standard and Poor's) for derivative positions with counterparties to which we had credit exposure (in thousands):

Foreign Counterparty Risk         Loans, acceptances, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments and any other monetary assets payable to us by entities of foreign countries, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated are referred to as "cross-border outstandings." Our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of short-term trading securities and Federal funds sold issued by banks and other financial institutions, which are non-sovereign entities, and derivative asset exposure with counterparties that are also non-sovereign entities. Secured reverse repurchase agreements outstanding are excluded from cross-border outstandings because they are fully collateralized. 
    
  In addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. Unsecured credit exposure continues to be cautiously placed, with non-derivatives exposure concentrated in the United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands and the Nordic countries.

Liquidity Risk Management:   Maintaining the ability to meet our obligations as they come due and to meet the credit needs of our members and housing associates in a timely and cost-efficient manner is the primary objective of managing liquidity risk. We seek to be in a position to meet the credit needs of our members, as well as our debt service and liquidity needs, without maintaining excessive holdings of low-yielding liquid investments or being forced to incur unnecessarily high borrowing costs. 

Operational liquidity, or the ability to meet operational requirements in the normal course of business, is currently defined in our RMP as sources of cash from both our ongoing access to the capital markets and our holding of liquid assets. We manage exposure to operational liquidity risk by maintaining appropriate daily liquidity levels above the thresholds established by our RMP. We are also required to manage liquidity in order to meet statutory and contingency liquidity requirements and Finance Agency liquidity guidelines by maintaining a daily liquidity level above certain thresholds also outlined in the RMP, federal statutes, Finance Agency regulations and other Finance Agency guidance not issued in the form of regulations. We remained in compliance with each of these liquidity requirements throughout the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
    
  We are focused on maintaining a liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities. Within the FHLBank System guidelines, each FHLBank develops its own metrics and milestones for enhancing its liquidity risk management practices. However, the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding management and jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, we may consider contractual maturities of the financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e., estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations).  See the Notes to the Financial Statements under Item 1 for more detailed information regarding contractual maturities of certain of our financial assets and liabilities.  
    
  We generally maintained stable access to the capital markets for the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  . For additional discussion of the market for our consolidated obligations and the overall market affecting liquidity see    Financial Market Trends    under this Item   2  . 
    
  Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post additional collateral with our counterparties if there is deterioration in our credit rating. See   Note 7 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 1   for additional information on collateral posting requirements and credit-risk-related contingent features. We believe that our liquidity position as of   September 30, 2016   was sufficient to satisfy the additional collateral that would be required in the event of a downgrade in our credit rating from double-A to single-A if the downgrade was effective at that time, and such amounts would not have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
  Minority and Women Inclusion.   On October 27, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to its Minority and Women Inclusion regulations that, if adopted, would clarify the scope of our obligation to promote diversity and ensure inclusion. These proposed amendments update existing Finance Agency regulations aimed at promoting diversity and the inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities in all our business and activities, including management, employment and contracting. The proposed amendments would: 
             
    require the FHLBanks to develop standalone diversity and inclusion strategic plans or incorporate diversity and inclusion into their existing strategic planning processes and adopt strategies for promoting diversity and ensuring inclusion; 
                
    encourage the FHLBanks to expand contracting opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities through subcontracting arrangements; 
                
    require the FHLBanks to amend their policies on equal opportunity in employment and contracting by adding sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as a parent to the list of protected classifications; and 
                
    require the FHLBanks to provide information in their annual reports to the Finance Agency about their efforts to advance diversity and inclusion through capital market transactions, affordable housing and community investment programs, initiatives to improve access to mortgage credit, and strategies for promoting the diversity of supervisors and managers.  
       
  Comments on the proposed amendments are due by December 27, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed amendments. 
    
  Indemnification Payments.   On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by an FHLBank or the Office of Finance to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action and that been initiated by the Finance Agency are only permitted if they relate to: 

premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or prior to September 20, 2016. 
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action initiated by the Finance Agency. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but do not anticipate that, if adopted, it would have a material impact. 
    
  FHLBank New Business Activities  . On August 23, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed a rule that, if adopted, would reduce the scope of new business activities (NBAs) for which an FHLBank must seek approval from the Finance Agency and would establish more certain timelines for Finance Agency review and approval of NBA notices. The proposed rule also would clarify the protocol for Finance Agency review of NBAs. Under the proposed rule, acceptance of new types of legally permissible collateral by the FHLBanks would not constitute a new business activity or require approval from the Finance Agency prior to acceptance. Instead, the Finance Agency would review new collateral types as part of the annual exam process. 
    
  On October 24, 2016, the FHLBanks provided comments to the proposed rule, which primarily related to certain procedures under the proposed rule. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would have a material impact. 
    
  Mandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs)  . On August 19, 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a proposed rule, which, if adopted, would require certain systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) regulated by the OCC to limit a counterparty s immediate termination or exercise of default rights in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the SIFI or an affiliate of the SIFI. Covered QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On May 3, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issued a substantively identical proposed rule with respect to QFCs entered into with globally systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs) and their affiliates that are subject to regulation in the U.S. 

88 

The FHLBanks provided comments on the FRB proposed rule on August 5, 2016 and to the OCC proposed rule on October 18, 2016, which primarily seek clarification of an exemption and the recognition of a safe harbor. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would have a material impact, but we would need to amend any covered QFCs entered into with FRB regulated GSIBs or OCC regulated SIFIs. 
    
  European Union (EU) Market Abuse Regulation  . The EU issued updated Market Abuse Regulations (MAR) that became effective July 3, 2016 and which contain rules on insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation for debt and equity securities on European securities exchanges, which differ in certain respects from U.S. regulations. MAR applies to companies with securities admitted to trading on EU exchanges on which FHLBank consolidated obligations are listed. MAR contains an exemption to its requirements for certain public bodies and central banks of third countries. The Office of Finance and the FHLBanks are examining, given their GSE-status, whether this exemption applies. If the exemption does not apply, we anticipate that the most significant impact of the MAR will be more stringent and detailed recordkeeping, creation of detailed lists on parties who have access to inside information, and notification requirements. 
    
  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 4210 establishing margin requirements for the  to-be-announced  (TBA) Market  . On June 15, 2016, the SEC approved a proposed rule by FINRA to require the margining of certain TBA transactions. Specifically, the approved FINRA Rule 4210 will require FINRA members to collect from, but not post to, their customers maintenance margin (i.e., initial margin) and variation margin on transactions that are  Covered Agency Transactions,  subject to certain exemptions. A  Covered Agency Transaction  includes (certain terms are defined under FINRA rules): 

TBA transactions inclusive of ARM transactions, and Specified Pool Transactions, for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than one business day; and 
                
    CMOs issued in conformity with a program of an Agency or a GSE for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than three business days. 
       
  Covered Agency Transactions with a counterparty in multi-family housing securities are exempt from the margin requirements if certain requirements are met. 
    
  Under the rule, we are exempt from posting initial margin, but would be required to post variation margin to our FINRA-member counterparties in connection with covered transactions if we have $10 million or more in gross open positions with the counterparty. FINRA members will be required to comply with the new margin requirements beginning in December 2017. 
    
  We are currently assessing the financial and operational impacts of this rule. 

Item   3  :     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risk Management 
  We measure interest rate risk exposure by various methods, including the calculation of duration of equity (DOE) and market value of equity (MVE) in different interest rate scenarios. 

Duration of Equity:   DOE aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of our financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. In essence, DOE indicates the sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates. However, MVE should not be considered indicative of our market value as a going concern or our value in a liquidation scenario. 

89 

We manage DOE within ranges approved by our Board of Directors as described under Item   7A   - "  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  " in the annual report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference herein. All of our DOE measurements were inside Board of Director established policy limits and operating ranges as of   September 30, 2016  . On an ongoing basis, we actively monitor portfolio relationships and overall DOE dynamics as a part of our evaluation processes for determining acceptable future asset/liability management actions. Table   39   presents the DOE in the base case and the up and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios as of the periods noted: 
    
  Table   39    

The DOE as of   September 30, 2016   decreased in the base and the up 200 basis point shock scenarios and increased slightly in the down 200 basis point shock scenario from   June 30, 2016  . The primary factors contributing to these changes in duration during the period were: (1) the increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the relative level of mortgage rates during the period; (2) the slight increase in the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio during the period along with a slight increase in the weighting of the portfolio as a percent of total assets; and (3) asset/liability actions taken by management throughout the period, including the continued call and re-issuance of long-term, unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds with short lock-out periods and the continued issuance of discount notes to fund the growth in advances. 
    
  The increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates during the third quarter of 2016 generally indicates a lengthening duration profile for both the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio and the associated unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds funding these assets. However, primary/secondary mortgage market spreads compressed during the quarter causing the effective mortgage rate to decline generating shortened durations for the fixed rate mortgage portfolio contributing to the more negative base case DOE. With the slight increase in our mortgage loan portfolio during the period, as discussed in Item   2        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition   MPF Program  ,  the portfolio increased as an overall percentage of assets as expected and as the balance sheet expanded, increasing from   13.9 percent   of total assets as of   June 30, 2016   to   14.0 percent   as of   September 30, 2016  . With this weighting increase, the mortgage loan portfolio continues to represent a sizable portion of the balance sheet, and changes occurring with this portfolio tend to be magnified in terms of DOE. Since the mortgage loan portfolio continues to comprise a considerable percentage of overall assets and has such a high duration relative to our other assets, its behavior is quite visible in the duration risk profile and changes in this portfolio are typically magnified as the composition of assets change. This magnification occurs when a portfolio market value weighting as a percent of the overall net market value of the balance sheet changes, causing the remaining portfolios to be a smaller or larger component of the total balance sheet composition. For example, if advance balances decrease during a given period, this decrease will cause the mortgage loan portfolio weighting to increase as a total proportion of total assets. Further, if interest rates decrease, the market value gains in the mortgage loan portfolio will cause the mortgage loan portfolio to further increase its sizable percentage of overall market value of assets. This increase in market value of assets will cause the duration for this portfolio to have a greater impact on DOE. In other words, this relationship causes the duration of the mortgage loan portfolio to have a larger contribution impact to the overall DOE since DOE is a market value weighted measurement. With these balance sheet dynamics, we continue to actively manage and monitor the contributing factors of our risk profile, including DOE. As the relationship of the fixed rate mortgage loan assets and the associated callable liabilities vary based on market conditions, we evaluate and manage these market driven sensitivities as both portfolios change in balance level and overall proportion. 
    
  New loans were continually added to the mortgage loan portfolio to replace loans that were prepaid during the period and we continue to actively manage this ongoing growth to position the balance sheet sensitivity to perform within our expected risk tolerances. To effectively manage these changes in the mortgage loan portfolio (including new production loans) and related sensitivity to changes in market conditions, a continued issuance of unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds with short lock-out periods (generally three months) positioned us to replace called bonds as the interest rate environment continued to remain at historically low levels. The call of higher rate callable bonds and reissuance of these bonds at lower interest rates in this manner generally extends the duration profile of this portfolio as bonds are called that are in-the-money (above market rates) and subsequently reissued at lower interest rates (at market rates). This liability extension corresponds with the expected longer duration profile of the new fixed rate mortgage loans, all else being equal. 
  
   90 

As discussed above, while intermediate- and long-term interest rates increased based on period-end dates, interest rates continued to remain low throughout the quarter and as we continued to experience prepayments of the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio, the short lock-out periods of the callable bonds plus some maturities of non-callable bonds provided the opportunity to continue the refinancing of our liabilities. The increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates during the period also caused the duration profile of the existing portfolio of unswapped callable bonds to lengthen along with the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio. This liability lengthening demonstrates the specific duration sensitivity to changes in interest rates at certain shock scenarios where the unswapped callable bonds are more or less sensitive to certain levels of declining interest rates, causing the overall DOE to increase or decrease, similar to the factors causing the changes in DOE for all interest rate shock scenarios. This sensitivity, or convexity, is further described under Item 7A   "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, issuance of discount notes continued in order to provide adequate liquidity sources to appropriately address customer short-term advance growth and associated capital stock activity during the period. The combination of all these factors contributed to the net DOE changes in all interest rate shock scenarios where the DOE decreased in the base and the up 200 interest rate shock scenarios and increased in the down 200 shock scenario. The down shock scenario continues to provide limited information since interest rates remain at historically low levels. This low interest rate environment essentially generates zero interest rates for the short- and mid-term interest rates along the down 200 shocked term structure of interest rates, causing valuation changes to be limited, generating DOE results with marginal information. 
    
  With respect to the GSE variable rate MBS portfolio, we generally purchase interest rate caps to offset the impact of embedded caps in this portfolio in rising interest rate scenarios. As expected, these interest rate caps are a satisfactory interest rate risk hedge to rising interest rates and provide an off-setting risk response to the risk profile changes in GSE variable rate MBS with embedded caps. We periodically assess derivative strategies to ensure that overall balance sheet risk is appropriately hedged within established risk appetite metrics and make adjustments to the derivative portfolio as needed. This evaluation is completed considering not only the par value of the variable rate MBS with embedded caps being hedged with purchased caps, but the composition of the purchased cap portfolio and expected prepayments of the variable rate MBS with embedded caps. This evaluation of the relative relationship between the variable rate investment portfolio and the purchased cap portfolio continues to indicate a sufficient hedging relationship. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we purchased $85.7 million of variable rate single-family and $24.0 million of variable rate multi-family GSE MBS. However, we did not purchase additional interest rate caps during the   third   quarter of   2016   because the investments did not contain interest rate cap exposure. In addition, we purchased $51.3 million fixed rate multi-family GSE MBS during the current quarter. These fixed rate securities were effectively swapped to LIBOR and impacted DOE only slightly since they are reflected as variable rate instruments and are further described in Item 2   "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Net Gain (Loss) on Trading Securities."  
    
  In calculating DOE, we also calculate our duration gap, which is the difference between the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. Our base duration gap was -1.3 months for   September 30, 2016   and -0.8 month for   June 30, 2016  . As discussed previously, the relatively stable performance and directional movement of the duration gap was primarily the result of the changes in the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio and the associated funding decisions made by management in response to changes in the interest rate environment and balance sheet during the   third   quarter of   2016  . All FHLBanks are required to submit this base duration gap number to the Office of Finance as part of the quarterly reporting process created by the Finance Agency. 

Market Value of Equity:   MVE is the net value of our assets and liabilities. Estimating sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is another measure of interest rate risk. We generally maintain an MVE within limits specified by the Board of Directors in the RMP. The RMP measures our market value risk in terms of the MVE in relation to total regulatory capital stock outstanding (TRCS). TRCS includes all capital stock outstanding, including stock subject to mandatory redemption. As a cooperative, we believe using the TRCS results in an appropriate measure because it reflects our market value relative to the book value of our capital stock. Our RMP stipulates MVE shall not be less than: (1) 100 percent of TRCS under the base case scenario; or (2) 90 percent of TRCS under a  200 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in interest rates. Table   40   presents MVE as a percent of TRCS. As of   September 30, 2016  , all scenarios are well above the specified limits and much of the relative level in the ratios during the periods covered by the table can be attributed to the relative level of the fixed rate mortgage loan market values as rates have continued to remain historically low, the general value impact of the refinancing activities of the associated unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds and the relative level of outstanding capital. 

91 

The MVE to TRCS ratios can be greatly impacted by the level of capital outstanding based on our capital management approach. Typically, as advances increase and the associated capital level increases, the ratio will generally decline since the new advances are primarily short-term with market values at or near par. Further, as advance balances decrease and the capital level decreases as capital stock is repurchased, the ratio will generally increase. These relationships primarily generate the changes in the MVE/TRCS levels and produce the changes in the ratios in all interest rate scenarios in the table below. In addition, the increase in the up 200 interest rate shock scenario is primarily the result of gains in our unswapped callable bonds as the below market rates provide a significant benefit as interest rates increase and generally exceed the losses in the mortgage asset portfolio. This increase indicates the market value of the unswapped callable bonds are more sensitive as interest rates rise and reflects the negative base case DOE, indicating more sensitive liabilities as rates change. 
    
  Table   40    

Detail of Derivative Instruments by Type of Instrument by Type of Risk  : Various types of derivative instruments are utilized to mitigate the interest rate risks described in the preceding sections as well as to better match the terms of assets and liabilities. We currently employ derivative instruments by designating them as either a fair value or cash flow hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a forecasted transaction, by acting as an intermediary, or in asset/liability management (i.e., an economic hedge). An economic hedge is defined as a derivative hedging specific or non-specific underlying assets, liabilities or firm commitments that either does not qualify for hedge accounting, or for which we have not elected hedge accounting, but is an acceptable hedging strategy under our RMP. For hedging relationships that are not designated for shortcut hedge accounting, we formally assess (both at the hedge s inception and monthly on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives used have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. We typically use regression analyses or similar statistical analyses to assess the effectiveness of our long haul hedges. We determine the hedge accounting to be applied when the hedge is entered into by completing detailed documentation, which includes a checklist setting forth criteria that must be met to qualify for hedge accounting.

Item   4  :     Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance in achieving their desired objectives; however, in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
    
  Management, with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II.     OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Item 1: Legal Proceedings  
  We are subject to various pending legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, management does not believe that we are subject to any material pending legal proceedings outside of ordinary litigation incidental to our business. 
    
  Item 1A:     Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on   March 10, 2016  , incorporated by reference herein.
