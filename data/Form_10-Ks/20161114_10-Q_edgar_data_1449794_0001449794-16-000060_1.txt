Note 1   Basis of Presentation 

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the  BHC Act ).   The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the  Bank ) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008.   Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow. Embassy Holdings, LLC (the  LLC ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank organized to engage in the holding of property acquired by the Bank in satisfaction of debts previously contracted.  As such, the consolidated financial statements contained herein include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and the LLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

The Bank, which is the Company s principal operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank s primary market area. 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year   ending   December 31  , 201  6  . 

The consolidated financial statements presented in this report should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on   March 30, 2016  .   

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluated the events and transactions that occurred after   September 30, 2016   through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued  . 

Certain amounts in the 201  5   financial statements may have been reclassified to conform to 201  6   presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on 201  5   net income.  

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The significant accounting policies of the Company as applied in the interim financial statements presented are substantially the same as those followed on an annual basis as presented in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 3   Stockholders  Equity 

On November 11, 2008, the Company consummated its acquisition of Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley pursuant to a Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated April 18, 2008, pursuant to which the Bank was reorganized into a bank holding company structure. At the effective time of the reorganization, each share of common stock of Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley issued and outstanding was automatically converted into one share of Company common stock. The issuance of Company common stock in connection with the reorganization was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(12) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

Note 4   Stock Incentive Plan   and Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

At the Company s annual meeting on June 16, 2010, the shareholders approved the Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the  SIP ).  The SIP authorizes the Board of Directors, or a committee authorized by the Board of Directors, to award a stock based incentive to (i) designated officers (including officers who are directors) and other designated employees at the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii) non-employee members of the Board of Directors and advisors and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries. The SIP provides for stock based incentives in the form of incentive stock options as provided in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and deferred stock awards.  The term of the option, the amount of time for the option to vest after grant, if any, and other terms and limitations will be determined at the time of grant. Options granted under the SIP may not have an exercise period that is more than   ten   years from the time the option is granted.   At inception, the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the SIP was   500,000  . The SIP provides for appropriate adjustments in the number and kind of shares available for grant or subject to outstanding awards under the SIP to avoid

dilution in the event of merger, stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in the capitalization of the Company. The SIP expires on June 15, 2020. At   September 30, 2016  ,    there   were   322,210   shares   available for issuance under the SIP.       

The Company grants shares of restricted stock, under the SIP, to certain members of its Board of Directors as compensation for their services, in accordance with the Company s Non-employee Directors Compensation program adopted in October 2010. The Company also grants restricted stock to certain officers under individual agreements with these officers. Some of these restricted stock awards vest immediately, while the remainder vest over   three   to   nine   service years. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the   restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Since inception of the plan and through the period ended September 30, 2016, there have been   65,774   awards granted.   No   awards were granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there were   5,934   and   9,122   awards granted, respectively. During the three and nine month months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recognized   $12   thousand and   $34   thousand, respectively, in compensation expense for the restricted stock awards.  There was   no   compensation expense recognized for the restricted stock awards during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

In January 2014, February   2013 and February 2012, the Company granted stock options to purchase   29,663  ,    29,742   and   52,611   shares of stock to certain executive officers in accordance with their respective employment agreements.   No   stock options were granted in   three   and nine months     ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015. Stock compensation expense related to the   prior grant of   options was   $6   thousand and   $10   thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock compensation expense related to   the prior grant of   options was   $21   thousand and   $34   thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016, approximately   $7   thousand of unrecognized cost related to stock options granted in 2014 will be recognized over the next   0.30   years. The fair   value of the options granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was determined with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yield of   0%  , risk free interest rate of   2.30%  ,    1.34%   and   1.43%  , respectively, expected life of   6.0   years,   6.0   years and   7.5   years, respectively, and expected volatility of   28.93%  ,    28.79%   and   31.10%  , respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was   $2.46  ,    $2.14   and   $2.56   per share, respectively. 

On July 15, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company ratified the implementation of the Embassy Bancorp, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This plan was approved by the Company s shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting held on June 16, 2016. Under the plan, each employee of the Company and its subsidiaries who   is employed on an offering date   and customarily is scheduled to work at least   twenty   (20) hours per week and more than   five   (5) months in a calendar year is eligible   to participate  . Embassy Bancorp, Inc. has authorized   350,000   shares of   its common stock for the plan, which will commence   January 1, 2017.

Note 5   Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income (loss). 

The components of other comprehensive income (loss), both before tax and net of tax, are as follows: 

A. 

Realized gains on securities transactions included in gain on sales of securities, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.     

B. 

Tax effect included in income tax expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.     

A summary of the realized gains on securities available for sale, net of tax, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Note 6   Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as adjusted for stock dividends and splits. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustments to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate solely to outstanding stock options and are determined using the treasury stock method. 

There were   no   stock options not considered in computing diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Note 7   Guarantees 

The Company, through the Bank, does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure, other than its standby letters of credit and FHLBank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ) deposit letters of credit. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Generally, all letters of credit, when issued, have expiration dates within   one   year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as those that are involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank generally holds collateral and/or personal guarantees supporting these commitments.   The Company had   $4.  1   million of standby letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The approximate value of underlying collateral upon liquidation that would be expected to cover this maximum potential exposure was $  3.  7   million. Management does not consider the current amount of the liability as of   September 30, 2016   for guarantees under standby letters of credit issued to be material  . 

FHLB deposit letters of credit are standby letters of credit commitments issued by the Bank for the benefit of a third party (the  Beneficiary ), which secure public deposits in the Bank. FHLB deposit letters of credit are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. The Company, through the   Bank, had   $4.5   million of FHLB   deposit letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .   

Note 8   Short-term and Long-term Borrowings 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and FHLB     short term advances generally represent overnight or less than twelve month borrowings. Long term advances from the FHLB are for periods of twelve months or more and are generally   less than   sixty   months  . The Bank has an agreement with the FHLB which allows for borrowings up to a percentage of qualifying assets. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity for short-term and long-term advances of approximately $  430.4   million.  This borrowing capacity with the FHLB includes a line of credit of $  150.0   million.   There were no short-term FHLB advances outstanding   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $39.3   million were outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . No l  ong-term advances   were   outstanding with FHLB   as   of   September 30, 2016   and   $3.8   million   were outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . All FHLB borrowings are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. 

The Bank has a federal funds line of credit with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ( ACBB ) of $  10.0   million  , of   which   none   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Advances from this line are unsecured. 

The Company has   a   line of credit with Univest Bank and Trust Co. ( Univest ) totaling   $4.0   million, of which   none   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This line of credit is secured by   333,333   shares of Bank common stock.

Note 9   Securities Available For Sale                   

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, the amortized cost and approximate fair values of securities available-for-sale were as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of securities as of   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without any penalties. 

Gross gains of $350 thousand were realized on the sales of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Gross gains of   $26   thousand and $165 thousand were realized on the sales of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were   no   gross losses on the sales of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Securities with a carrying value of   $75.8   million and   $  64.9   million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were subject to agreements to repurchase, pledged to secure public deposits, or pledged for other purpose  s required or permitted by law.

The following table shows the Company s investments  gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively: 

The Company had sixteen (16) securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016.   The unrealized losses are due only to market rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company either has the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity or market price recovery, or believes that it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell such securities.  Management believes that the unrealized loss only represents temporary impairment of the securities.  None of the individual losses are significant. 

Note 10   Restricted Investment in Bank Stock 

Restricted investments in bank stock consist of   FHL  Bank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ) stock and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ( ACBB ) stock.  The restricted stocks are carried at cost.  Federal law requires a member institution of the FHLB to   hold stock of its district FHLB according to a predetermined formula.  The Bank had FHLB stock at a carrying value of   $87   thousand and   $2.2     million   repurchased during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and   $428   thousand and $542 thousand   w  ere   repurchased during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    There were no stock purchases for the three months ending September 30, 2016 and     $537     thousand   were made during   the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Stock purchases of   $855   thousand and     $2.7     million     were made   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Dividend payments of   $4     thousand   and   $45   thousand were received during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   and   $22   thousand and   $80   thousand were received during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Management evaluates the FHLB and ACBB restricted stock for impairment. Management s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on their assessment of the ultimate recoverability of their cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of their cost is influenced by criteria such as (1) the significance of the decline in net assets of the issuer as compared to the capital stock amount for the issuer and the length of time this situation has persisted, (2) commitments by the issuer to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the issuer, and (3) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and, accordingly, on the customer base of the issuer. 

Based upon its evaluation of the foregoing criteria, management believes no impairment charge is necessary related to the FHLB or ACBB stock as of   September 30, 2016  .

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

The Company may grant a concession or modification for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial condition that it would not otherwise consider, resulting in a modified loan which is then identified as troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ).  The Company may modify loans through rate reductions, extensions to maturity, interest only payments, or payment modifications to better coincide the timing of payments due under the modified terms with the expected timing of cash flows from the borrowers  operations.  Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral.  TDRs are considered impaired loans for purposes of calculating the Company s allowance for loan losses. 

The Company identifies loans for potential restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and the evaluation of the borrower s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports.  Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future.

Note 12   Fair Value Measurements    

The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 

Fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

ASC Topic 860 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 860 are as follows: 

Level 1  : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.  

Level 2  : Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  

Level 3  : Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity). 

An asset s or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

For financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy utilized at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are as follows:

For financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are as follows: 

Impaired loans are those that are accounted for under existing FASB guidance  ,    in which the Bank has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the  

properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.  

At   September 30, 2016  , of the impaired loans having an aggregate balance of   $10.8   million,   $9.7   million did not require a valuation allowance because the value of the collateral, including estimated selling costs, securing the loan was determined to meet or exceed the balance owed on the loan. Of the remaining $  1.1   million in impaired loans, an aggregate valuation allowance of $  319   thousand   was required to reflect what was determined to be a shortfall in the value of the collateral as compared to the balance on such loans.  

Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are to be sold and are carried at fair value less estimated cost to sell.  Fair value is based upon independent market prices or appraised value of the property.  These assets are included in Level 3 fair value based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and for which   the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value: 

1. 

Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include Level 3 inputs which are not identifiable.     

2. 

Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors including economic conditions and the age of the appraisal. The range and weighted average of appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal.     

3. 

Appraisals and pending agreements of sale are adjusted by management for liquidation expenses.  The range and weighted average of liquidation expense adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal or pending agreement of sale.     

4. 

Fair value is determined by listings, letters of intent or third-party evaluations.     

The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Cash and Cash Equivalents (Carried at Cost) 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and short-term instruments approximate those assets  fair values.  

Interest Bearing Time Deposits (Carried at Cost) 

Fair values for fixed-rate time certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits. The Company generally purchases amounts below the insured limit, limiting the amount of credit risk on these time deposits.  

Securities Available for Sale (Carried at Fair Value) 

The fair value of securities available for sale are determined by matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security s terms and conditions, among other things. 

Loans Receivable (Carried at Cost) 

The fair values of loans, excluding impaired loans carried at fair value of collateral, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest rate-risk inherent in the loans. Projected future cash flows are calculated based upon contractual maturity or call dates, and projected repayments and prepayments of principal. Generally, for variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Restricted Investment in Bank Stock (Carried at Cost) 

The carrying amount of restricted investment in bank stock approximates fair value, and considers the limited marketability of such securities.  

Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable (Carried at Cost) 

The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates its fair value. 

Deposit Liabilities (Carried at Cost) 

The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and noninterest checking, passbook savings and money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.  

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Federal Funds Purchased and Short-Term Borrowings (Carried at Cost) 

These borrowings are short term and the carrying amount approximates the fair value. 

Long-Term Borrowings (Carried at Cost) 

Fair values of FHLB and Univest advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on quoted prices for new FHLB and Univest advances with similar credit risk characteristics, terms and remaining maturity. These prices obtained from this active market represent a market value that is deemed to represent the transfer price if the liability were assumed by a third party.

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments (Disclosed at Cost) 

Fair values for the Company s off-balance sheet financial instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged in the market to enter into similar agreements, taking into account, the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments were as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Note 13   Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 

The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities.  Under these arrangements, the Company may transfer legal   ownership   over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase the assets.  As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities.  The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the Company's consolidated statements of condition, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities. In addition, as the Company does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements, there is no such offsetting to be done with the repurchase agreements. 

The right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default (e.g., fails to make an interest payment to the counterparty). For private institution repurchase agreements, if the private institution counterparty were to default (e.g., declare bankruptcy), the Company could cancel the repurchase agreement (i.e., cease payment of principal and interest), and attempt collection on the amount of collateral value in excess of the repurchase agreement fair value. The collateral is held by a third party financial institution in the counterparty's custodial account. The counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the investment securities. For government entity repurchase agreements, the collateral is held by the Company in a segregated custodial account under a tri-party agreement. 

The following table presents the liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or repurchase agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of   securities pledged was   $  12.8 million and     $35.0   million, respectively.

Note 14   New Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  The new guidance will be effective for public companies for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with private companies provided a one-year deferral until periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The ASU permits application of the new revenue recognition guidance to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company has not yet determined which application method it will use or the potential effects of the new standard on the financial statements, if any. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will supersede the current lease requirements in Topic 840. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and related lease liability for all leases, with a limited exception for short-term leases. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. Currently, leases are classified as either capital or operating, with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet. The reporting of lease related expenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally consistent with the current guidance. The new guidance will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and for years beginning after December 15, 2019 for private companies. Once effective, the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  This ASU was issued as part of FASB s Simplification Initiative.  The areas for simplification in this Update include income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows for share-based payment transactions.  For public companies, this ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  For all other entities, the amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016  -  13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 requires entities to report  expected  credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit rather than the current  incurred loss  model. These expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU will also require enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filers, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this   u  pdate are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations.

OVERVIEW 

The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the  BHC Act     ). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the  Bank ) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow. Embassy Holdings, LLC (the  LLC ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the B  ank organized to engage in the holding of property acquired by the Bank in satisfaction of debts previously contracted.  As such, the consolidated financial statements contained herein include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and the LLC. 

The Bank, which is the Company s primary operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank s primary market area. 

The Company s assets increased $  85.3   million from   $  804.0   million at   December 31, 2015   to $  889.3   million at   September 30, 2016   due primarily to an increase in   loans receivable and securities  . 

Net income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     was     $2.0   million   compared to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $1.9 million.   Net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $5.3   million compared to a net income   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $5.5 million. The difference in net income for the nine months ended  

28   

September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 resulted, in part, from the costs associated with opening a new branch in December 2015 and a commercial loan recovery of $169 thousand in interest income during the nine months ended June 30, 2015. 

Loans receivable, net of the allowance for loan losses,   increased $  65.9   million to $  749.9   million at   September 30, 2016   from $  684.0   million at   December 31, 2015  .    With the market being     very   competitive  ,   the Company   remains   committed to maintaining a high quality portfolio that returns a reasonable market rate. The Company expects to increase lending activity, as the Company expands its presence and   benefits from the impact of recent mergers within its marketplace.   The past and current economic conditions have created lower demand for loans by credit-worthy customers.  The lending staff has been active in contacting new prospects and promoting the Company s name in the community. Management believes that this will translate into continued growth of a portfolio of quality loans and core deposit relationships, although there can be no assurance of this.   The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any future market rate adjustments. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income 

Total interest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled $  7.7   million and   $7.3   million, respectively.  Average earning assets were $  845.5   million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to $  763.1   million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The tax equivalent yield on average earning assets was   3.70%   for the   third   quarter of   2016     compared to   3.87%   for   the   third   quarter of   2015  . 

Total interest expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased $  193   thousand to $  1.0     million   as compared to $  814   thousand for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to growth in savings balances and certificates of deposit balances and rates, offset by a   slight   decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase balances and a   significant   decrease in FHLB borrowings.        Average interest bearing liabilities were $  693.8   million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to $  640.3   million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The yield on average interest bearing liabili  ties was   0.58%     and   0.50%     for the   third   quarter of   2016     and   2015  , respectively  .   

Net interest   income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was $  6.7   million compared to $  6.4   million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The improvement in net interest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   is a result of the growth in the loan portfolio   and decrease in   securities sold under ag  reements to repurchase balances and   FHLB borrowing  s  , offset by growth in savings and certificate  s of deposit  . The Company s net interest margin for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased twenty-three   (23)   basis points to   3.22%   as compared to   3.45%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to the current interest rate environment and competitive pressure, inclusive of decreased interest rates on the loan portfolio and increased interest rates on certificate  s of deposit, offset by a decrease in   securities sold under ag  reements to repurchase balances and   FHLB borrowing  s  . 

Total interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $22.4   million and   $21.0   million, respectively.  Average earning assets we  re   $820.9     million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $734.1   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The tax equivalent yield on average earning assets for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   nineteen    (  19  ) basis points to   3.74%   as compared to   3.93%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   

Total interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased $  568   thousand to   $2.9   million as compared to $  2.3   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The increase is primarily due to growth   in savings balances and growth in certificates of deposit balances and rates, offset by a   slight   decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase b  alances and a decrease in FHLB   borrowing  s.     Average interest bearing liabilities were   $677.8   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $617.8   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The yield on average interest bearing liabilities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased seven (7) basis points   to   0.57%   from   0.50%   as of   September 30, 2015  .   

Net interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $19.5   million compared to   $18.7   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .    The improvement in net interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is a result of the growth in the loan portfolio     and decrease in   securities sold under ag  reements to repurchase balances and FHLB   borrowing  s  , offset by growth in savings and certificate  s   of   deposit.   The Company s net interest margin for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   twenty-four (24) basis   point  s   to   3.27%   as compared to   3.51%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,    due to the current interest rate environment and competitive pressure, inclusive of decreased interest rates on the loan portfolio and increased interest rates on certificate  s of deposit.

Provision for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against income. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 

The allowance for loan l  osses is maintained at a level   management   considers   to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. 

The allowance consists of general, specific, qualitative and unallocated components. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors.  The specific component relates to loans that are classified as watch, other assets especially mentioned, sub  standard, doubtful or loss. S  uch loans may also be classified as im  paired and/or   restructured.  For loans that are further classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.  

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. I  mpairment is measured on a loan-by-  loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the colla  teral if the loan is collateral-  dependent. 

Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer and home equ  ity loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement or there is a possible loss expected. 

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the provision for loan losses was   $165   thousand, as compared to   $270   thousand   for the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .    In the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were charge-offs in the amount of $204 thousand and no recoveries, as compared to   $16   thousand in charge-offs and $10 thousand in recoveries for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .        For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the provision for loan losses was $420 thousand, as compared to   $412   thousand for the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were charge-offs in the amount of   $  248 thousand and no recoveries, as compared to   $72   thousand in charge-offs and $10 thousand in recoveries during the same period in   2015  .    The allowance for loan   losses is $  6.2   million as of   September 30, 2016  , which is   0.83%   of outstanding loans, compared to $  6.0   million or   0.87%   of outstanding loans as of   September 30, 2015  . At   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for loan losses of $  6.1   million represented 0.  88  % of total outstanding loans. Based principally on economic conditions, asset quality, and loan-loss experience, including that of comparable institutions in the Bank s market area, the allowance is believed to be adequate to absorb any losses inherent in the portfolio. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate, or that material increases will not be necessary should the qu  ality of the loans deteriorate.   The Bank has not participated in any sub-prime lending activity. 

32   

The activity in the allowance for loan losses is shown in the following table, as well as period end loans receivable and the allowance for loan losses as a percent of the total loan portfolio: 

Non-interest Income 

Total non-interest income was   $1.1     million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $653   thousand for the same period in   2015  .    The increase is due primarily to a $350 thousand gain on the sale of securities in the quarter ending September 30, 2016, compared to $26 thousand in the same period in 2015, an increase in income associated with bank owned life insurance and no impairment losses on other real estate owned for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, as compared to $62 thousand in the same period in 2015.   Total non-interest income was   $2.3   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.1   million for the same period in   2015  .    The   increase   is due primarily   to the $350 thousand gain on the sale of securities in 2016 compared to $165 thousand in the same period in 2015 and increased fee income due to growth in the Bank s credit card and merchant processing customer base, offset by a decrease in the income associated with bank owned life insurance valuation  . 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expenses   increased     $575 t  housand     from   $4.2   million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $4.8   million for the same   period ended   September 30, 2016  .    The increase is due to: an increase of $  316   thousand in salaries and employee benefits due to   salary increases   and new hires   including those   for the Nazareth   branch opened   in December 2015;   an increase of $74 thousand in occupancy and equipment due primarily to the addition of the Nazareth branch;     an increase of $36 thousand in data processing expense due to an increase in our customer base and transaction volume; an increase of $54 thousand in professional fees and an increase of $24 thousand in other operating expenses .  

Non-interest expenses increased   $1.5 million   from   $12.6   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $14.1   million for the same period ended   September 30, 2016  .    The increase is due to: an increase of $  778   thousand in salaries and employee benefits due to   salary increases   and new hires   including those   for   the   Nazareth   branch opened   in December 2015;   an increase of $207 thousand in occupancy and equipment due primarily to the addition of the Nazareth branch;     an increase of $61 thousand in credit card processing due to increased processing volume; an increase of $42 thousand in advertising and promotion expense due primarily to new advertising campaigns; an increase of $76 thousand in professional fees; an increase of $55 thousand in FDIC insurance expense; an increase of $47 thousand in charitable contributions due to EITC contributions     and an increase of $138 thousand in other operating expenses. 

A breakdown of other expenses can be found in the statements of income. 

33   

Income Taxes 

The allocated provision for income taxes for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $816   thousand, or   28.9%   of income before taxes. The provision for income taxes for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   totaled $  766   thousand, or   29.0%   of income before taxes.  The allocated provision for income taxes for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $2.1   million, or   28.8%   of income before taxes. The provision for income taxes for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   totaled   $2.2   million,   or   28.6%   of income before taxes.   The slight   increase   in the tax rate   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015   is primarily the result of the change in the mix of taxable and tax free loans and investments.    

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Securities 

The Bank s securities portfolio continues to be classified, in its entirety, as  available for sale.  Management believes that a portfolio classification of available for sale allows complete flexibility in the investment portfolio. Using this classification, the Bank intends to hold these securities for an indefinite amount of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Such securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders  equity. The portfolio is structured to provide maximum return on investments while providing a consistent source of liquidity and meeting strict risk standards. Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by FHLMC or FNMA, and taxable and non-taxable municipal bonds. The Bank holds no high-risk securities or derivatives as of   September 30, 2016  . The Bank has not made any investments in non-U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities or sub-prime loans. 

Total securities at September 30, 2016 were $90.0 million compared to $77.3 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in the investment portfolio is the result of the purchase of two (2) mortgage-backed securities totaling $15.4 million, the purchase of six (6) U.S. Government agency obligations totaling $5.1 million, purchase of eighteen (18) municipal obligations totaling $8.0 million, an increase in unrealized gains, offset by pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, maturities, calls     and the sale of eight (8) taxable municipal obligations totaling $7.8 million. The carrying value of the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2016 includes a net unrealized gain of $2.4 million, which is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders  equity net of income tax effect. This compares to a net unrealized gain of $1.9 million at December 31,   2015  . The current unrealized gain position of the securities portfolio is due to the changes in market rates since purchase. No securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. 

Loans 

The loan portfolio comprises a major component of the Bank s earning assets. All of the Bank s loans are to domestic borrowers. Total net loans at   September 30, 2016   increased   $65.9   million to   $749.9   million from   $684.0   million at   December 31, 2015  . The loan-to-  deposit ratio decreased from     105%   at   December 31, 2015   to   94%   at   September 30, 2016  . The Bank s loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was comprised of residential real estate and consumer loans of   $394.3   million, an increase of   $46.3   million from   December 31, 2015  , and commercial loans of   $361.7   million, an increase of   $19.7   million from   December 31, 2015  .  The Bank has not originated, nor does it intend to originate, sub-prime mortgage loans. 

Credit Risk and Loan Quality 

The allowance for loan losses increased   $172   thousand to   $6.2   million at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $6.1   million at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for loan losses represented   0.83%     and 0.88%,   respectively, of total loans. Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, the perceived credit risk in the portfolio and loan-loss experience of   the Bank and   comparable institutions in the Bank s market area, management feels the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses. 

At   September 30, 2016  ,    December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015   aggregate balances on non-performing loans equaled   $5.9   million,   $5.5   million and   $5.8   million, respectively, representing   0.78%  ,    0.79%   and   0.85%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  ,    December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Troubled debt restructurings, included in the following table, represent loans where the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, has granted a concession to the debtor that it would not oth  erwise consider.    There were no loans that were modified and classified as a TDR   within the prior twelve   months that experienced a payment default (loans ninety or more days past due) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company has three (3) foreclosed assets in the amount of $521 thousand as of September 30, 2016, of which none is residential real estate, as compared   to four (4) foreclosed assets at December 31, 2015 in the amount of $1.2 million with $221 thousand in residential real   estate.  The net change is a result of: the sale of two (2) assets in the amount of $264 thousand, the sale of a portion of a foreclosed property in the amount of $400 thousand, an $80 thousand impairment loss and the addition of one (1) foreclosed asset in the amount of $41 thousand  , which was sold subsequent to September 30, 2016.   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had $49  5   thousand and $529 thousand, respectively, in recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure.    

34   

The details for non-performing loans are included in the following table: 

Premises and Equipment 

Company premises and equipment, net of accumulated   depreciation,   decreased    $  77   thousand from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . This decrease is due primarily   to depreciation on existing premises and equipment, offset by increases related to purchases. 

Deposits 

Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   increased $  141.5   million to $  801.8   million from $  660.3   million at   December 31, 2015   due to   enhanced deposit advertising, opening of the Nazareth branch, expansion of existing deposit relationships, and customer migration due to recent merger activity in the Company s local marketplace. Demand deposits increased $37.0 million, time deposits increased $28.5 million, and savings deposits increased $76.0 million. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the Company s ability to meet the demands required for the funding of loans and to meet depositors  requirements for use of their funds. The Company s sources of liquidity are cash balances, due from banks, and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents were $  28.7   million at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  19.5   million at   December 31, 2015  . 

Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from the investment security and loan portfolios. Long-term liquidity needs may be met by selling unpledged securities available for sale, selling loans or raising additional capital. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had $  90.0   million of available for sale securities. Securities with carrying values of approximately $  75.8   million and $  64.9   million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, public deposits, and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity for short-term and long-term advances of approximately   $  430.4 million.  This borrowing capacity with the FHLB includes a line of credit of   $150.0   million. There were no short-term FHLB advances outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and $39.3 million were outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . No long-term FHLB advances were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and $3.8 million were outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . All FHLB borrowings are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. 

The Bank has a federal funds line of credit with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ( ACBB ) of   $  10.0   million, of which none was outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .    Advances from this line are unsecured. 

The Company has   a line of credit with   Univest   totaling   $4.0   million  , of which   none   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Th  is line   of credit   is   secured by   333,333   shares of Bank common stock. 

The Company has no investment in or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or capital resources.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These off-balance sheet arrangements consist of unfunded loans and commitments, as well as lines of credit made under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. These unused commitments   totaled $  109.0   million    a  t    September 30, 2016  .    At   September 30, 2016   the Company also had letters of credit outstanding   of $  4.1   million   and FHLB deposit letters of credit outstanding   of $  4.5 million. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Company. Management is of the opinion that the Company s liquidity is sufficient to meet its anticipated needs. 

Capital Resources and Adequacy 

Total stockholders  equity was   $73.0   million as of   September 30, 2016  , representing a net increase of $  4.9     million   from   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in capital was primarily the result of the net income of $  5.3     million   and an increase of $327 thousand in unrealized gains on available for sale securities,   offset by dividends   declared   of $96  2   thousand. 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  

The regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and Tier I capital to average assets (as defined). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank met the minimum requirements. In addition, the Bank s capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered  well capitalized  as defined in the regulations. 

The following   table provides a comparison of the Bank s risk-based capi  tal ratios and leverage ratios: 

Note: Unrealized gains on securities available for sale are excluded from regulatory capita  l components of risk-based   capital and leverage ratios  . 

The Federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies. Currently, the required minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of the total capital is required to be Tier I capital, consisting principally of common shareholders  equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill. The remainder (Tier II capital) may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities, perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance. 

In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier I capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. 

36   

The following table provides the Company s risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios:                   

In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that substantially revised the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the  Basel III  regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes  capital  for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a  capital conservation buffer  of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. In January 2016, the new capital conservation buffer requirement started being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.

Item 3       Quantitative   and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not Applicable. 

Item 4       Controls   and Procedures 

The term  disclosure controls and procedures  is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , and they have concluded that, as of this date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at ensuring that required information will be disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the Exchange Act. 

There were no significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting or in the other factors that could significantly affect our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weakness.
