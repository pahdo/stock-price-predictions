  NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  
  Organization and Nature of Operations  
 Bright Mountain Media, Inc. is a Florida corporation formed on May 20, 2010.   The Company is a media holding company of online assets.  The Bright Mountain strategy is to concentrate its marketing and development primarily to military and public safety audiences and associated demographic.  We sell various products through our proprietary websites and retail location, and through third party e-commerce distributor portals.  Our websites provide content designed to attract and retain targeted Internet audiences and contain a number of sections with demographically oriented information including originally written news content, blogs, forums, career information, and video.  We generate revenues from two segments, product sales and services.  Services consist of advertising revenue and subscription revenue.  Our advertising revenue is generated primarily through the display of paid listings as well as display advertisements appearing on our websites. Bright Mountain plans to grow its business through organic growth and acquisitions.  When used herein, the terms  BMTM,  the  Company,   we,   us,   our  or  Bright Mountain  refers to Bright Mountain Media, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Bright Mountain, LLC and The Bright Insurance Agency, LLC, an inactive company. 
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 have been made. The results of operations for such interim period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the full year.  
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Our consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, the fair value of acquired assets for purchase price allocation in business combinations, valuation of inventory, valuation of intangible assets, estimates of amortization period for intangible assets, estimates of depreciation period for fixed assets, valuation of equity based transactions, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  
 The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 
   
 We adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .   This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1: 
   Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: 
   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: 
   Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use 

Accounts Receivable  
   
 Accounts receivable are recorded at fair value on the date revenue is recognized. The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to repay their obligation. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay, additional allowances may be required. The Company provides for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on specific customer identification and historical collection experience adjusted for existing market conditions. If market conditions decline, actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in decreased cash flows and increased bad debt expense. 
   
 The policy for determining past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of each customer, which are generally net 30 or net 60 days. Once collection efforts by the Company and its collection agency are exhausted, the determination for charging off uncollectible receivables is made. 
   
  Inventories  
   
 Inventories consist of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Provisions have been made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their net realizable value. 
   
  Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue on our products in accordance with ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition .   Under these guidelines, revenue is recognized on sales transactions when all of the following exist: persuasive evidence of an arrangement did exist; delivery of product has occurred; the sales price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has several revenue streams generated directly from its website and specific revenue recognition criteria for each revenue stream is as follows: 

Sale of merchandise directly to consumers: The Company's product sales are recognized either FOB shipping point or FOB destination, dependent on the customer. Revenues are therefore recognized at point of ownership transfer, accordingly;

  (Unaudited)  

Advertising revenue is received directly form companies who pay the Company a monthly fee for advertising space; 

Advertising revenues are generated by users  clicking  on website advertisements utilizing several ad network partners: Revenues are recognized, on a net basis, upon receipt of payment by the ad network partner since the revenue is not determinable until it is received; and 

Subscription revenues are generated by the sale of access to career postings on one of our websites. The term of the subscriptions range from one month to twelve months. Revenues are recognized, on a net basis, over the term of the subscription period. All sales are final per the subscription Terms of Use. 

The Company follows the guidance of ASC 605-50-25,   Revenue Recognition, Customer Payments .   Accordingly, any incentives received from vendors are recognized as a reduction of the cost of products included in inventories. Promotional products or samples given to customers or potential customers are recognized as a cost of goods sold. Cash incentives provided to our customers are recognized as a reduction of the related sale price, and, therefore, are a reduction in sales. 
   
  Cost of Sales  
   
 Components of costs of sales include product costs, shipping costs to customers and any inventory adjustments.  
   
  Shipping and Handling Costs  
   
 The Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and shipping and handling costs for shipments to customers as cost of revenues. 
   
  Sales Return Reserve Policy  
   
 Our return policy generally allows our end users to return purchased products for refund or in exchange for new products. We estimate a reserve for sales returns, if any, and record that reserve amount as a reduction of sales and as a sales return reserve liability. Sales to consumers on our web site generally may be returned within a reasonable period of time. 
   
  Product Warranty Reserve Policy  
   
 The Company is a retail distributor of products and warranties are the responsibility of the manufacturer. Therefore, the Company does not record a reserve for product warranty  
   
  Property and Equipment  
   
 Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets of seven years for office furniture and equipment, and five years for computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life of the improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs along with fixed assets below our capitalization threshold of $500 are expensed as incurred. 
   
  Website Development Costs  
   
 The Company accounts for its website development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) ASC 350-50,   Website Development Costs   ( ASC 350-50 ). These costs, if any, are included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or expensed immediately if the Company cannot support recovery of these costs from positive future cash flows.

BRIGHT MOUNTAIN MEDIA, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

ASC 350-50 requires the expensing of all costs of the preliminary project stage and the training and application maintenance stage and the capitalization of all internal or external direct costs incurred during the application and infrastructure development stage. Upgrades or enhancements that add functionality are capitalized while other costs during the operating stage are expensed as incurred. The Company amortizes the capitalized website development costs over an estimated life of five years. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, all website development costs have been expensed. 
   
  Amortization and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
   
 Amortization and impairment of long-lived assets are non-cash expenses relating primarily to website acquisitions. The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10   Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .  This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  
   
 Website acquisition costs are amortized over five years. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. While it is likely that we will have significant amortization expense as we continue to acquire websites, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired website to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of assets, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business. Non-cash amortization loss is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statement of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, non-cash amortization expense was $61,582 and $0, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, non-cash amortization expense was $186,007 and $131,937, respectively.   
   
  Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 The Company accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees for services in accordance with ASC Topic 718   Compensation   Stock Compensation .  ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an employee award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC Topic 505-50,   Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees .   The Company estimates the fair value of stock options by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Non-cash stock-based stock option compensation is expensed over the requisite service period and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, non-cash stock-based stock option compensation expense was $30,069 and $13,480, respectively.  Non-cash stock option compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $107,193 and $42,604, respectively. 
   
  Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Costs  
   
 Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statement of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, advertising, marketing and promotion expense was $15,156 and $17,541, respectively.

Income Taxes  
   
 We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that, based on available evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. 
   
 The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10     Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.   When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements   in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be   sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or   aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest   amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The   portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as   a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would   be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, tax years 2015, 2014, and 2013 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit or any notifications from the IRS for any of the open tax years. 
   
  Basic and Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share  
   
 In accordance with ASC 260-10   Earnings Per Share ,  basic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 there were approximately 2,267,000 and 1,605,000 common stock equivalent shares outstanding as stock options, respectively, 100,000 and 5,200,000 common stock equivalents from the conversion of preferred stock, respectively, and 200,000 and 0 common stock equivalents from the conversion of notes payable, respectively. Equivalent shares were not utilized as the effect is anti-dilutive. 
   
  Segment Information  
   
 In accordance with the provisions of ASC 280-10,   Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information  , the Company is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. The Company has two identifiable operating segments based on the activities of the company in accordance with the ASC 280-10. The Company's two segments are product sales and services as of September 30, 2016. The product sales segment sells merchandise directly to customers thorough e-commerce distributor portals such as Amazon and eBay and through our proprietary websites and retail location. The services segment is focused on producing advertising revenue generated by users  clicking  on website advertisements utilizing several ad network partners and direct advertisers and subscription revenue generated by the sale of access to career postings on one of our websites.

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10  Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606) : identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern ,  which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In July 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inve ntory  more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The amendments in this ASU do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which aims to eliminate diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for the Company). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
  NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN.  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company sustained a net loss of $1,989,265 and used cash in operating activities of $1,394,127 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $8,147,020 at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and its ability to continue receiving investment capital and loans from related parties to sustain its current level of operations. 
   
 Management plans to continue to raise additional capital through private placements and is exploring additional avenues for future fund-raising through both public and private sources.  
   
 The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3   ACQUISITIONS.  
   
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, on January 2, 2016, the Company closed the acquisition of warisboring.com pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Website Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 4, 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000.

The Company recorded the future monthly payments totaling $150,000 at a present value of $117,268, net of discount of $32,732.  The present value was calculated at a discount rate of 12% (which is the Company s most recent borrowing rate) using the estimated future revenues from the website to estimate the payment dates.  The estimated future revenues from the website were based on the average historical monthly revenues from the website prior to the Company s acquisition.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company amortized $8,184 of this discount.  The acquisition was accounted following ASC 805   Business Combinations .   Under the purchase method of accounting, the transaction was valued for accounting purposes at $217,268, which was the discounted fair value of warisboring.com.  The Company has initially determined there was only two amortizable intangible assets.  The acquisition date estimated discounted fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following: 

The above estimated discounted fair value of the intangible assets are based on a preliminary purchase price allocation prepared by management.  As a result, during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, we may record adjustments to the asset acquired, with the corresponding offset to website.  After the preliminary purchase price allocation period, we record adjustments to assets acquired subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in our operating results in the period in which the adjustments were determined.

  NOTE 8   RELATED PARTIES.  
   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company issued two $100,000 12% convertible notes to a related party director and founder that had  conversion prices that created a beneficial conversion.  The notes had a maturity date of December 22, 2020 and bore an interest rate of 12% paid monthly in cash on the first day of each month, commencing on January 1, 2016.  A beneficial conversion feature exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the face value of the note. In accordance with this guidance, the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as a debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the five-year life of the note using the effective interest method.

The Company has reserved for issuance an aggregate of 900,000 shares of common stock under the 2013 Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Company stock that shall be subject to grants made under the 2013 Plan to any individual during any calendar year shall be 180,000 shares.

 On May 22, 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2015 Stock Option Plan (the  2015 Plan ), to be effective on May 22, 2015.  Effective August 3, 2015, and as disclosed in the Company's Information Statement on Schedule 14C, the Company's majority shareholders ratified the adoption of the 2015 Plan.  The Company has reserved for issuance an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock under the 2015 Plan.

As of September 30, 2016, 399,000 shares were remaining under the 2015 Plan for future issuance. 
   
 On March 22, 2016 the Company granted 100,000 ten-year stock options, which have an exercise price of $0.695 per share to an executive officer and director.  The aggregate fair value of these options was computed at $39,901 or $0.3990 per option.  
   
 On March 22, 2016 the Company granted 46,000 ten-year stock options, which have an exercise price of $0.695 per share to a director.  The aggregate fair value of these options was computed at $18,354 or $0.3990 per option. 
   
 On July 12, 2016, the Company granted 360,000 ten-year stock options, to five employees including one officer, which have an exercise price of $0.85 per share. The aggregate fair value of these options was $179,640 or $0.499 per option. 
   
 The Company estimates the fair value of share-based compensation utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables such as the expected option term, expected volatility of our stock price over the expected option term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, expected dividend yield rate over the expected option term, and an estimate of expected forfeiture rates. 
   
 The Company believes this valuation methodology is appropriate for estimating the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors, which is subject to ASC Topic 718 requirements. These amounts are estimates and thus may not be reflective of actual future results, nor amounts ultimately realized by recipients of these grants. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each award. The following table summarizes the assumptions the Company utilized to record compensation expense for stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The expected life is computed using the simplified method, which is the average of the vesting term and the contractual term. The expected volatility is based on an average of similar public companies historical volatility.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yields with terms equivalent to the expected term of the related option at the time of the grant. Dividend yield is based on historical trends. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable, the compensation expense recorded would increase if the expected life was increased, a higher expected volatility was used, or if the expected dividend yield increased. 
   
 The Company recorded $30,069 and $13,480 stock option expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company recorded $107,193 and $42,604 stock option expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The $107,193 non-cash stock option expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 has been recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

However, cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limit of $250,000 are at risk. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had cash balances above the FDIC insured limit of approximately $0 and $0, respectively. At September 30, 2016, our accounts receivable included amounts due from INFORM and Medium Corporation representing 17% and 14%, respectively, of total accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its trade accounts receivable customers and generally does not require collateral. 
   
  Concentration of Funding  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's funding was provided by the sale of shares of the Company's common stock to a related party officer and director. 
   
  NOTE 11   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.  
   
 On October 20, 2016 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Sostre Enterprises, Inc. to purchase certain assets of that company which constitute its Black Helmet apparel division, including blackhelmetapparel.com, for an aggregate purchase price of (i) $250,000 in cash, (ii) 200,000 shares of our common stock, (iii) the forgiveness of the working capital advances described below, and (iv) the assumption of certain liabilities not to exceed $40,000.  At closing we expect to enter into employment agreements with the two principals of the seller.  Under the terms of the letter of intent we agreed to make working capital advances to the seller of up to $200,000 to be used for the purchase of inventory and advertising and marketing.  As of November 14, 2016 the Company has lent Sostre Enterprises, Inc. an aggregate of $98,000 under the terms of an 8% revolving credit note with personal guarantee. 
   
 The closing of the transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including, but not limited to, the delivery by the seller of audited financial statements of the business for such periods as may be required in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  While we expect that the financial statements can be audited in accordance with these regulations, an audit of the financial statements has not yet commenced.  While the letter of intent provides that the parties will use their best efforts to close the transaction by January 31, 2017, the ability to consummate the transaction is dependent upon the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to closing, including the delivery of the audited financial statements.  As such, and as it is possible that we may be unable to consummate this transaction, investors should not place undue reliance on the execution of this non-binding letter of intent. 
   
 Between October 14, 2016 and November 11, 2016 the Company borrowed an aggregate of $350,000 from its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer under the terms of 12% convertible promissory notes.  The notes mature five years from the date of issuance and are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of $0.50 per share.  The Company used the proceeds for working capital. 

On October 16, 2016, the Company issued 3,600 shares to a consultant for services rendered at $0.85 per share, with a fair value of $3,060 on the date of grant.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     
   
 The following discussion of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operation  s for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend,   may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. 
   
  Overview   
   
 We are a media holding company for online assets primarily targeted to the military and public safety sectors. We own and manage websites, which are customized to provide our niche users, including active duty, reserve and retired military, law enforcement, and fire fighters with information and news that may be of interest to them. We generate revenues from two segments, services and product sales. Services consist of advertising revenue and subscriptions. Within our product sales segment, we generate product sales revenue through e-commerce distributors portals such as Amazon and eBay, and direct sales though proprietary websites and a retail location.  The following graph provides historical quarterly total revenue in the respective periods presented: 
   
   Quarterly Total Revenue   

Key Third Quarter 2016 highlights include:  

total revenue of $405,737, a revenue decline of 6% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015; 
   
 total revenue of $1,289,322 with revenue growth of 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015; 
   
 services revenue growth of 19% quarter over quarter for the third quarter; 
   
 services revenue growth of 63% period over period for the first nine months of the year; 
   
 product sales revenue decline of 11% quarter over quarter for the third quarter; 
   
 product sales revenue growth of 7% period over period for the first nine months of the year; 
   
 acquired two new web properties; and  
   
 raised $1,200,000 in new capital through the sale of equity and debt securities. 

25 

Many of these increases are being powered by website traffic increases of 43% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 as a result of organic growth and acquisitions.  The following graph provides information on the annual traffic to our proprietary websites over the respective quarterly periods presented: 
   
   Quarterly Website Traffic (Visits)   

2016 is a transitional year for our company as we invest in the infrastructure required to create more content, website traffic and expand our ability to sell our advertising inventory.  Historically, a majority of our revenues have come from product sales.  As a result of the consistent increase in both the overall site traffic as well as unique visitors to our websites, we believe our company has reached sufficient critical mass to begin the multi-year transition to a media company that generates most of its revenue from the sales of advertising on its websites.  We believe that this natural evolution of our model will permit us to concentrate our efforts on growing our highest profit opportunities through the leverage of our website portfolios and growing Internet audience. To begin implementing the next segment of our business model, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we began a rebranding of our company which included a name change to  Bright Mountain Media, Inc.   
   
 Since inception we have chosen to be a provider of quality website content to our niche market through our content staff of writers and others which, in our opinion, has been the principle reason for the growth in our website traffic. Subject to availability of additional capital, we expect to begin adding more content staff including writers, graphic designers, videographers and social media personnel, as well as former military and public safety individuals to create additional content for our websites.  We believe these steps will help drive additional traffic to our websites which in turn will allow us to better leverage the highly targeted website traffic on our web properties and increase advertising revenues.  
   
 A key component of our growth also remains our acquisition strategy.  We remain committed to expanding our portfolio of web properties in 2016 and beyond with additional acquisitions that fit strategically into our business objectives. So far in 2016, we have acquired   www.warisboring.com       and   www.sargeslist.com      .  Our ability to continue our acquisition strategy, however, is dependent on our ability to raise additional working capital, both to fund the costs of the transactions as well as the integration and expansion of the acquired companies and web properties.  During the first quarter of 2016 we also entered into a publishing distribution agreement with A Medium Corporation for   www.warisboring.com       content which was migrated to the Medium platform.  We anticipate an increase in advertising revenue for the warisboring content from this relationship beginning in the third quarter 2016.  
   
 While we continue to increase our revenues, we reported a net loss of $808,401 for the third quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $1,989,265 for the first nine months of 2016.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 our average total monthly operating overhead was approximately $350,000 of which, approximately $117,000 was cash operating overhead.  As we continue to grow our business we expect that our monthly cash operating overhead will continue to increase as we add personnel, although at a lesser rate and we are not able at this time to quantify the amount of this expected increase.  

26 

We do not anticipate that we will generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations for the next 12 months.  As a result, we will need to raise additional working capital to fund our ongoing operations as well as to provide additional funds for the further evolution of our business.  During nine months ended September 30, 2016 we raised $1,200,000 in capital through the sale of equity and debt securities to a related party.  We presently estimate we will need to raise significant additional capital to satisfy our working capital needs for the next 12 months.  We do not have any firm commitments for this necessary capital and there are no assurances we will be successful in raising the capital upon terms and conditions, which are acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise the necessary additional working capital, absent a significant increase in our revenues, of which there is no assurance, we will be unable to continue to grow our company and may be forced to reduce certain operating expenses in an effort to conserve our working capital. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $1,989,265, cash used in operating activities of $1,394,127 and we had an accumulated deficit of $8,147,020 at September 30, 2016.  The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years then ended contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our net losses, cash used in operations and accumulated deficit.  These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to generate revenues or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company. 
   
  Results of operations   

Revenue  
   
 Revenues decreased somewhat in our product sales during the third quarter.  Service revenues for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 increased over comparable periods of the prior year. The decrease in product sales primarily reflects a decrease in watch sales from on-line marketing of our products through third parties. This sharp increase in service revenues reflects the increase in visitor traffic to our previously existing websites as well as traffic from additional websites acquired in 2016 and 2015. 
   
 In addition to our corporate website, we currently own 25 websites, and partner with a third party on two additional websites under a revenue sharing arrangement entered into in January 2016. To date we have reported minimal revenues under this agreement. We intend to continue our concentration on increasing our website traffic through organic growth as well as our program of website acquisitions focused on our targeted market segment. 
   
  Cost of Sales  
   
 Cost of sales as a percentage of product sales has declined for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. This decline was due in large part to larger discounts being offered on many of our watch products in 2015 that were not offered in 2016. These discounts were intended to liquidate slower moving items for a measured period, which was successful. We continue to expand our product lines and strengthen our purchasing power to minimize the negative effect of selling discontinued or slow moving products. We do not incur any cost of sales related to our service revenues. 

27 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable periods of the preceding year. This increase is both in amounts recognized as well as selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, totaling 169% and 171% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 120% and 131% for the comparable periods of the preceding year. 
   
 A significant portion of the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses between years was attributable to non-cash expenses recognized including amortization expense attributable to websites acquired of $61,582 and $186,007 for three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45,801 and $131,937 for the same periods in 2015. In addition, stock options compensation expense totaled $30,069 and $107,193 in the 2016 periods compared to $13,480 and $42,604 in the 2015 periods, respectively. This increase in option compensation expense is expected to increase as we continue to attract qualified employees while minimizing, as much as possible, cash demands related to increased staffing. During the first quarter 2016 we increased staffing to support targeted growth with salaries and employee medical expenses increasing 8% and 46% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. During the second quarter 2016, we implemented a partial staff reduction to reduce staffing and related costs. Legal fees increased 42% and 27% in the 2016 periods over the prior year which includes 30% paid in stock in 2016. Rent expense increased 0% and 51%, respectively, between periods reflecting expansion of our corporate offices following our third quarter 2016. 
   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as we execute our planned growth strategy of increasing website visits both organically and through targeted acquisitions. 
   
  Total other income (expense)  
   
 Total other income (expense) primarily reflects interest expense associated with our borrowings under convertible notes.  The significant increases in interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the conversion of $603,600 of principal and accrued interest owned under those notes into shares of our common stock during the third quarter of 2016 which required us to recognize the debt discount as interest. 
   
  Non-GAAP financial measure  
   
 We report Adjusted net (loss) to measure our overall results because we believe it better reflects our net results by excluding the impact of non-cash equity based compensation. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our operations by excluding interest and certain additional non-cash expenses.  These measures are one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our business, on which our internal budgets are based. We believe the presentation of Adjusted net (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA enhances our investors' overall understanding of the financial performance of our business. 
   
 We believe that investors have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.  
   
 We believe these measures are useful for analysts and investors as the measures allows a more meaningful year-to-year comparison of our performance.  The items below are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income/loss generated from our business. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our statement of operations of certain expenses. 

28 

The following is an unaudited reconciliation of net (loss) to Adjusted net (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented: 

Liquidity and capital resources   
   
 Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. As of September 30, 2016 we had $102,341 in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $838,660, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $416,187 in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $1,246,265 at December 31, 2015. Our principal sources of operating capital have been equity and debt financings from related parties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we continued to use our working capital to purchase additional websites as well as to fund our operating expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased two websites for an aggregate amount of $265,000 of which $115,000 was paid in cash and the balance of $150,000, is payable monthly in an amount equal to 30% of the net revenues from the website, when collected, with the total amount of the earn out to be paid by January 4, 2019.  
   
  Cash flows  
   
 Net cash flows used in operating activities was $1,394,127 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,208,343 used in operating activities for the same period in 2015.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we used cash primarily to fund our net loss of $1,989,265.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we used cash primarily to fund our net loss of $1,081,117 and increases in our inventory of $289,284. These increases were offset by a decrease in prepaid costs and expenses and an increase in our accounts payable.  
   
 Net cash flows used in investing activities was $177,961 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $184,862 used in investing activities for the same period in 2015 due to the purchase of fixed assets, the cash acquisition costs associated with the purchase of two websites in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and cash payment obligations related to a website acquired in 2015.  
   
 Net cash flows provided from financing activities was $1,258,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,157,390 for the same period in 2015. In both periods, cash was provided from the sale of our securities, net of repayments of debt obligations and in 2016 from the issuance of long-term debt to our chairman and CEO. 
   
  Critical accounting policies  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Recent accounting pronouncements  
   
 The recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies as described in Note 1 appearing earlier in this report that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. 

29 

All other newly issued accounting pronouncements, but not yet effective, have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 
   
  Off balance sheet arrangements  
   
 As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement  generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

    ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.     
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  
   
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.   
   
 Subject to the availability of sufficient funds during 2016 to expand our accounting staff, we also expect to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and, if necessary, hire independent third parties or consultants to provide expert advice as needed. We do not, however, expect that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls will be remediated until such time as we have improved our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
