EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A ( Amendment No. 1 ) amends the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Great Basin Scientific Inc. (the  Registrant ) for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on August 11, 2016 (the  Original 10-Q ). This Amendment No. 1 is being filed for the sole purpose of correcting the certifications required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  302 Certifications ), certain provisions of which were inadvertently omitted when the Original 10-Q was filed. The amended 302 Certifications are being filed in their entirety as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Amendment No. 1. Each certification, as corrected by this amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, was true and correct as of the date of the Original Report.

Except as described above, this Amendment No. 1 does not amend any other information set forth in the Original 10-Q and the the Registrant has not updated disclosures included therein to reflect any events that occurred subsequent to August 11, 2016. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original 10-Q and the Registrant s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original 10-Q. The filing of this Amendment No. 1 shall not be deemed an admission by the Registrant that the Original 10-Q, when made, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement contained therein not misleading.
