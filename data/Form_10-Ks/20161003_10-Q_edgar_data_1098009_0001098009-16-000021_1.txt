  CROWN MARKETING AND SUBSIDIARIES   
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015  
  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1     BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Crown Marketing and Subsidiaries (the    Company   ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2016.   
   
  Going Concern  
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,082,860 and used cash to fund operating activities of $474,645, and at March 31, 2016, had a shareholders    deficit of $1,025,230.  These factors create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   
 The Company's management plans to continue as a going concern revolve around its ability to achieve profitable operations, as well as raise necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on securing additional sources of capital and the success of the Company's plan.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. 
 Our cash needs for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 were primarily met by a note payable of $500,000 from a company owned by our majority shareholder.   As of March 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $15,346.  Our majority shareholder is providing all of our working capital and will continue to do so until at least June 30, 2016.  We will require approximately $1 million and up to 12 months to complete remediation and building refit prior to being able to re-lease our warehouse space to customers.   
   
  NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   
  Basis of Consolidation 
  
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Okra Energy, Crown Laboratory and Crown Mobile, Inc., a joint venture that is 50% owned by the Company (See Note 6). Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Estimates  
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities and the assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015  
  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Revenues  
 In the nine months ended March 31, 2016, we derived our revenue primarily from the sale of hover boards and vaping equipment, as well as minimal sales of cellular phones through September 30, 2015.  The Company also markets Chinese herbal and other remedies in the People   s Republic of China, but has not sold any of these products in China as of March 31, 2016.  The Company recognizes revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized for hardware product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. These estimates are based on contractual return rights, historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time. If actual future returns and pricing adjustments differ from past experience and our estimates, adjustments to revenue reserves may be required. 
  Inventories  
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value. At March 31, 2016, inventories consisted of recent purchases of vaping devices and related supplies, which the Company began selling during the three months ended December 31, 2015. 
  Fair Value Measurements  
   
 Fair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 
   
 Level 1     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2     Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3     Unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions. 
   
 The Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort. 
   
 The Company   s financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature. 
  Loss per Share  
 Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company   s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.

NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
  Stock-Based Compensation  
 The Company periodically grants stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions as compensation for services rendered. The Company accounts for stock option and stock warrant grants to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and stock warrant grants to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board where the value of the stock compensation is determined based upon the measurement date at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option or warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. 
  Segment Information  
 At September 30, 2015, the Company had three reportable operating segments. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company disposed of its interest in one of its segments, the Mobile segment, which distributed prepaid SIM cards and wireless phones (see Note 6). On December 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the sale of the Company   s interest in Crown Mobile for $25,000, which approximated the Company   s basis in Crown Mobile on that date. The Marketing segment leases an 180,000 square foot facility which it plans to sublease. The Laboratory segment develops and markets Chinese herbal and other remedies in the People   s Republic of China and also sells vaping equipment and balanced scooters, along with other products.  
 The chief operating decision-maker evaluates performance, makes operating decisions and allocates resources based on the operating income of each segment. The reporting segments follow the same accounting polices used in the preparation of the Company   s condensed consolidated financial statements.   
 Summarized financial information by segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, based on the Company   s internal financial reporting system utilized by the Company   s chief operating decision maker, follows: 

For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of sales. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company had foreign sales of $2,605 to one person located in the Peoples Republic of China. All other sales were domestic sales in the United States. For the nine months ended March 31, 2015, there was only one segment, the Marketing segment, which recorded no revenues, $443,077 of rent expense (related party), $34,117 of selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a net loss of $477,194.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.  The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein.  Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company   s financial statements and disclosures. 
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity   s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity   s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity   s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company   s financial statements and disclosures. 
   
 In February, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions).  ASU 2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company   s consolidated financial statements.   
   
 Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or is not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.

  LEASE OBLIGATION  
   
 Through its subsidiary, Crown Laboratory Inc., the Company leases a warehouse in El Monte, California. The warehouse is owned by Temple CB LLC, (   Temple CB   ), a single member limited liability company owned by the Company   s President and majority shareholder. The Company plans to sublease the warehouse but will require approximately $1 million and up to 12 months to complete remediation and a building refit prior to being able to re-lease the warehouse building to customers. 
   
 The lease commenced December 2, 2013, terminates May 31, 2020, and requires monthly lease payments of $30,000 beginning June 1, 2014. The monthly lease payment increases to $40,000 on June 1, 2015, $50,000 on June 1, 2016, $60,000 on June 1, 2017, and $70,000 on June 1, 2019. The lease includes a period of free rent from December 2, 2013 to May 31, 2014. The lease is an operating lease. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the entire lease period. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $147,692 of rent expense for each period, respectively. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $443,077 of rent expense for each period, respectively. As of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company recorded a deferred lease obligation of $618,462 and $535,384, respectively.

  NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015  
  (UNAUDITED)  
  NOTE 4     CONVERTIBLE, REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK  
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company   s Board of Directors authorized the creation of a series of preferred stock consisting of 1,000,000 shares designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the    Series A   ). The Series A is entitled to a dividend of 4%, when and as declared, and is entitled to a liquidation preference of $1 per share plus unpaid dividends. The Series A is redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a price of $1.00 per share, plus 4% per annum thereupon from the date of issuance (the    Stated Value   ). In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Series A shall be entitled to a preferential amount equal to the Stated Value, prior to the holders of common stock receiving any distribution. Each share of Series A is automatically converted on the Conversion Date into a number of shares of common stock of the Company at the initial conversion rate (the    Conversion Rate   ), which shall be the Stated Value as of the date of conversion divided by the Market Price. The Market Price for purposes of this Section 5 shall be equal to the average closing sales price of the Common Stock over the 5 previous trading days. 
 The Series A is also subject to adjustments to the Conversion Rate. If the common stock issuable on conversion of the Series A is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the holders of the Series A shall, upon its conversion, be entitled to receive, in lieu of the common stock which the holders would have become entitled to receive but for such change, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders if they had exercised their rights of conversion of the Series A immediately before that change. 
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company issued 500,000 shares of its Series A to Temple CB, a single member LLC owned by the Company   s majority shareholder, in satisfaction of $500,000 of accrued rent (see Note 3). The Company plans to issue the remaining 500,000 authorized shares of its Series A preferred stock to Temple CB during the second half of 2016 in satisfaction of additional accrued rent. 
  NOTE 5     SHAREHOLDERS    DEFICIT  
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company issued 75,000,000 shares of common stock to a consultant, which was valued at $525,000 based on the closing price of the Company   s common stock on the date of the grant, and included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. In July 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement under which the consultant agreed to return the shares to the Company in exchange for a cash payment (see Note 7). 
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the sale of the Company   s interest in Crown Mobile for $25,000, which approximated the Company   s basis in Crown Mobile on that date.

NOTE 6     NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST  
 During 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture to create Crown Mobile. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company disposed of its interest in Crown Mobile. Crown Mobile was in the business of selling mobile phones and sim cards and generated revenues of $4,876 during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. The Company owned 50% of the joint venture while two other owners owned 35% and 15%, respectively. Based on the authoritative guidance of the FASB on consolidation, the Company determined it should include Crown Mobile in its consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary since the Company has a controlling financial interest and directed the operating activities of Crown Mobile. The non-controlling interest represents the minority stockholders    share of 50% of the equity of Crown Mobile. On December 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the sale of the Company   s interest in Crown Mobile for $25,000, which approximated the Company   s basis in Crown Mobile on that date. 
 The table below reflects a reconciliation of the equity attributable to non-controlling interest: 
 
  NOTE 7    SUBSEQUENT EVENT  
 On July 7, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a party who had received 75,000,000 shares under the Company   s Form S-8. The agreement provides for the return of these shares upon payment of $17,500 to the consultant. The payment has not yet been made and the share certificate is in escrow pending payment.

  Forward Looking Statement Notice  
   
 Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are     forward-looking statements     (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.  Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Crown Marketing,(    we    ,     us    ,     our     or the     Company    ) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.  Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. 
  History and Organization  
 Crown Marketing is a Wyoming corporation (the  Company ). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated December 2, 2013, the Company acquired all of the common stock of Okra Energy, Inc., a California corporation that was subscribed for on December 2, 2013 and then incorporated on December 18, 2013, in exchange for 16,155,746,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the  Common Stock ) at the closing of the Agreement on December 3, 2013. Immediately prior to the closing, there were approximately 3,825,275,800 shares of Common Stock outstanding. After the closing, the beneficial owner of Okra Energy, Inc. shareholder, Jay Hooper, owned approximately 98.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger (recapitalization) with Okra Energy, Inc. deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed to be the legal acquirer. The financial statements presented herein are those of the accounting acquirer. The Company subsequently changed its name from Crown Marketing to Okra, Inc., but later changed the name of the Company back to Crown Marketing. 
 Concurrently with the merger, Jay Hooper was appointed as the sole director and President of the Company. 
  Overview of Business  
 Through its subsidiary, Crown Laboratory Inc., the Company leases a warehouse in El Monte, California. The warehouse is owned by Temple CB LLC, (   Temple CB   ), a single member limited liability company owned by the Company   s President and majority shareholder. The Company plans to sublease the warehouse but will require approximately $1 million and up to 12 months to complete remediation and a building refit prior to being able to re-lease the warehouse building to customers. 
 The Company continues to expand its business activities. A new subsidiary, Crown Laboratory Inc., has been formed to develop and market consumer products, including the Company   s brand of household good and home electronics under the trademark Crown Laboratory     as well as Chinese and other herbal remedies. Initial capitalization of $10,000 was provided by a loan from an entity controlled by the Company   s President. The loan is due on demand and bears interest at 4%. We expect to require additional funding for this business segment and have already commenced obtaining FDA approval for our products. In August, 2015, the lessor of the Company   s premises, which is also a related party, loaned $500,000 to Crown Laboratory. 
 In March 2015, the Company also began a joint venture, Crown Mobile, in which the Company owns a 50% interest. Crown Mobile is a MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) and markets Crown Mobile prepaid mobile telephone service using T-Mobile   s wireless network. Crown Mobile intends to offer ancillary services such as a proprietary debit card. The Company disposed of its interest in Crown Mobile during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.

  Going Concern  
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company is still in the development stage and has not yet been successful in establishing profitable operations.  The Company incurred a net loss of $1,082,860 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and the Company's shareholders    deficit was $1,025,230 as of March 31, 2016.  These factors create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   
 Primarily as a result of our recurring losses and our lack of liquidity, we received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2015 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The Company's management plans to continue as a going concern revolve around its ability to achieve profitable operations, as well as raise necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on securing additional sources of capital and the success of the Company's plan.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. 
 Our cash needs for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 were primarily met by a note payable of $500,000 from a company owned by our majority shareholder.   As of March 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $15,346.  Our majority shareholder is providing all of our working capital and will continue to do so until at least June 30, 2016.  We will require approximately $1 million and up to 12 months to complete remediation and building refit prior to being able to re-lease our warehouse space to customers.  Due to our limited operating history, we believe that we will need to sell common equity to raise the required funds. We have no arrangement or understanding pursuant to which we might obtain such funding.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
   Revenues   
   
 In the nine months ended March 31, 2016, we derived our revenue primarily from the sale of hover boards and vaping equipment, as well as minimal sales of cellular phones through September 30, 2015.  The Company also markets Chinese herbal and other remedies in the People   s Republic of China, but has not sold any of these products in China as of March 31, 2016.  The Company recognizes revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized for hardware product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. These estimates are based on contractual return rights, historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time. If actual future returns and pricing adjustments differ from past experience and our estimates, adjustments to revenue reserves may be required.  
  
  Estimates   
   
 The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods.  Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements.  The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others, the fair value of shares of common stock issued for services. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.

  Results of Operations  
   Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015   
 The Company is engaged in various business activities, including operating a warehouse building in El Monte, California and in acquiring commercial properties, with a focus on properties in Los Angeles County in need of environmental remediation.  The Company also distributes a variety of consumer products, including vaping equipment and supplies, and balance scooters. As of March 31, 2016, inventory was comprised almost entirely of vaping products.  After March 31, 2016, the Company began marketing 4K LED flat screen televisions and other consumer products under the Crown Laboratory trademark.  We also develop and market Chinese herbal and other remedies in the People   s Republic of China, but have not enjoyed sales from this activity. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we had revenues of $1,062,916, which primarily related to the sale of vaping equipment and balance scooters, and incurred a gross loss of $96,326, as the Company liquidated some scooters at a loss following adverse publicity regarding alleged safety issues with the scooter industry. No complaints or problems were received with respect to the Company   s products. Sales returns after March 31, 2016 were minimal.  No one customer accounted for more than 10% of gross sales for the 2016 period. We had no revenues or gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had rent expenses from a related party of $147,692 for both periods. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses were $30,773 and $11,088, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, other income and expense consisted of interest expense of $15,058 and rental income of $15,000. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $274,849 and $158,780, respectively. 
   Results of Operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2015   
   
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, we had revenues of $2,597,752, which primarily related to the sale of vaping equipment and balance scooters, and incurred a gross loss of $30,281, as the Company liquidated some scooters at a loss following adverse publicity regarding alleged safety issues with the scooter industry. No complaints or problems were received with respect to the Company   s products. Sales returns after March 31, 2016 were minimal.  No one customer accounted for more than 10% of gross sales for the 2016 period. We had no revenues or gross profit during the nine months ended March 31, 2015. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had rent expenses from a related party of $443,077 for both periods. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses were $614,886 and $34,117, respectively. SG A expenses during the nine months ended March 31, 2016 were significantly higher than during the same period in 2015 due to the fair value of common stock issued for services in fiscal 2016 in the amount of $525,000. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, other income and expense consisted of interest expense of $39,916 and rental income of $45,300. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $1,082,860 and $477,194, respectively. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 
  For the nine months ended March 31, 2016   
  Cash flows used in operating activities  
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the Company had cash flows used in operating activities of $474,645 compared to $50,117 of cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2015. The reasons for the increase in cash used in operating activities in the amount of $424,528 was due mainly to our net loss of $1,082,860 during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $477,194 during the same period in 2015, and the increase in inventories of $184,779, offset by the issuance of stock issued for services of $525,000. 
  Cash flows provided by financing activities   
 During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, we had proceeds from a note payable from a related party of $500,000. We also received advances from a related party in the amount of $34,977 and repaid advances from that related party of $71,262.  

17  
  Financial Position  
 As of March 31, 2016, we had $15,346 in cash, working capital of $110,148 and an accumulated deficit of $2,070,730. 
 As of June 30, 2015, we had $24,276 in cash, negative working capital of $456,986 and an accumulated deficit of $997,812. 
 As of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, $34,977 and $71,262, respectively, was due to the Company   s President and majority shareholder, Mr. Jay Hooper, for advances made to the Company to pay for operating expenses.  The advances are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.   
   
 As of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, a loan of $10,000 due to Mr. Hooper is due on demand and bears interest at 4%.   
   
 In August 2015, the lessor of the Company   s premises, which is also a related party, loaned $500,000 to the Company. The loan accrues interest at 12% per annum and is secured by essentially all assets of the Company.  The unpaid principal and all accrued but unpaid interest is due and payable on or before July 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2016, $500,000 of principal and $16,916 of accrued interest was owed on the note. 
   
  Forward Looking Statements  
 Information included in this report includes forward looking statements, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate, or continue, or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. The statements in  Risk Factors  and other statements and disclaimers in this report constitute cautionary statements identifying important factors, including risks and uncertainties, relating to the forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. 
  Our activities have mostly been devoted to seeking capital; seeking supply contracts and development of a business plan.  We do not believe that conventional financing, such as bank loans, is available to us due to these factors.  We have no bank line of credit available to us.  Management believes that it will be able to raise the required funds for operations from one or more future offerings, in order to affect our business plan. 
 Our future operating results are subject to our attaining certain milestones, including: 
   
 -     our success in subleasing the warehouse property; 
 -     our ability to obtain additional financing; and 
 -     other risks which we identify in future filings with the SEC. 
   
 Any or all of our forward looking statements in this filing and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. In addition, we undertake no responsibility to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances which occur after the date of this report. 
   
  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We do not have any contractual obligations or off balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
   
 As a          smaller reporting company    as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

18  
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 The Company   s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, performed an evaluation of the Company   s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d -14 (c) as of March 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to enable us to accurately record, process, summarize and report certain information required to be included in the Company   s periodic SEC filings within the required time periods, and to accumulate and communicate to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
  Changes in Internal Controls  
   
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls. 

19  
  PART II         OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.  
   
 We are not a party to or otherwise involved in any legal proceedings. 
   
 In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions.  The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations.  However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors.  
   
 As a      smaller reporting company      as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 
   
  Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  
   
 None. 
   
  Item 3.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
