DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Dominovas Energy, is part of the fuel cell and sustainable/alternative energy industry.  Fuel cells are an efficient, combustion-less, reliable, and virtually pollution-free energy source that provide electricity to power a wide array of applications, including buildings (manufacturing facilities, hotels and hospitals), primary power for grid integration, automobiles, emergency back-up systems, and base load grid power.  A fuel cell uses fuel - usually hydrogen, extracted from common fuels such as natural gas - to produce electricity.  In principle, a fuel cell is an electrochemical device that operates like a battery.  However, unlike a battery, a fuel cell requires re-fueling and not recharging.  Fuel cells will continue to produce electricity and heat as long as there is a constant fuel source.  Hydrogen fuel cells work simply, have no moving parts, and operate silently, with water and excess heat as their only by-products.  Fuel cells, thus, provide the ideal solution for a myriad of portable, on-board, and stationary electric power generation applications.

Dominovas Energy has identified marketing and sales opportunities for fuel cells in emerging market countries, where electricity supply is frequently unreliable, antiquated, and expensive as compared to the cost of electricity and the production, thereof, in the United States.  Dominovas Energy currently has active projects in Africa.  Dominovas Energy works with and has engaged the host nation s government.  Initial project sizes range from 3 to 200 Megawatts (MW), with eventual project sizes of up to 3000 MW.  Project cost projections range from $25 million and beyond. Dominovas Energy will provide power to the local utilities under power purchase agreements (PPA s), and prior to deployment it will require specific guarantees, bonding or other credit support, as necessary, where the local contracting entities do not enjoy strong credit ratings. 

The Dominovas Energy fuel cell system is named RUBICON .  It is a modular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system that operates at high temperatures (up to 800 C).  Dominovas Energy has identified the following advantages of its technology over competitive energy producing systems:  (1) all solid components, (2) accelerated electrochemical kinetics proceed without the need for expensive noble metals such as platinum, (3) internal fuel reforming is possible and carbon monoxide may be used as a fuel and (4) more tolerant of fuel contaminants, including sulfur, because per design of the system these components dissipate  before deposition onto the fuel cell components. 

Additional advantages of the RUBICON  are that it is silent and environmentally friendly, and capable of reforming multiple fuels such as diesel, natural gas, propane, ethanol, syngas, methanol and bio-fuels. 

Dominovas Energy will source the manufacture for the build of its RUBICON  and will source as necessary with key OEM partners for additional components required to meet the multi-MW production schedule based upon the amount of MWs that are projected specific to projected sales. 

Dominovas Energy is headquartered at 1170 Peachtree Street N.E., 12 th  Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30309.  All manufacture of the RUBICON  will be completed prior to shipment and deployment, once the manufacturing site has been determined. 

Historically, the primary manufacturing challenges for the commercial development of the SOFC market were the lack of companies with the necessary resources to support stack development and the subsequent requirements, as are key to the integration of the stack with a reformer.  Dominovas Energy Corporation has partnered with AVL List, Gmbh (AVL), and the leading fuel cell systems integration company in the world.  AVL is based in Gratz, Austria but also has offices in Michigan, USA, with a track record of over 15 years of SOFC R D and product development experience, along the sizeable capital commitment that is required to develop a commercial product.  AVL List GmbH is the world s largest independent company for the development of powertrain systems (internal combustion engines, batteries and fuel cells) as well as instrumentation and test systems.  Founded in 1948, AVL built its reputation by providing world-class products and services for the most challenging applications, both in the region and around the globe. AVL has more than 100 projects supporting its experience in Fuel Cell engineering.  A provider of diverse products and specialized services, AVL is partnered with many of the world s leading and most recognizable companies to provide those companies with advanced technology, products, and services.  The technological contribution by Dominovas Energy to its projects includes, but is not limited to its proprietary algorithms, which the Company believes improves the operating conditions and efficiencies of utilizing multiple fuel.  The Company will also install the RUBICON s   power electronics along with a  state of the art  communications suite infrastructure within each RUBICON .  These components allow for the remote monitoring of the system, as well as the internal operations of each unit. 

Given the vast need for electricity in emerging markets around the globe, Dominovas Energy has been very measured in its selection process for specific target markets.  Initial deployments of the RUBICON  will be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other select sub-Saharan markets where the Company has secured commitments by government officials to deploy a specific number of MWs.  The initial clients include government agencies and operations and Mines. 

5 

Dominovas Energy also has projects earmarked in the private and governmental sectors of additional African countries and has an expectation of a positive close to the sales cycle to generate an additional 500MW   1500MW of new business in the foreseeable future. 

COMPETITORS AND DOMINOVAS ENERGY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 

Dominovas Energy s  competitors  are not  competitors  in the true sense of the word.  It s  competitors  produce and sell specific technologies (not fuel cell) that are currently being deployed to provide electricity within the theaters of operation that Dominovas Energy is engaging.  Primarily, GenSets, gas turbines, micro-turbines, solar and wind technologies are Dominovas Energy s competitors.  These competing technologies are expected to offer power as generators within power plants, as well as when used as standalone power generators.    

There are several competing fuel cell technologies.  Alkaline fuel cell technology requires pure hydrogen as a fuel and, since it operates at low temperature (50-250 C), an expensive catalyst (platinum) is needed.  Molten Carbonate fuel cells operate at higher temperature and use lower-cost nickel as a catalyst; however, they require a corrosive electrolyte.  Phosphoric Acid fuel cells and proton exchange membrane (PEM) all require pure hydrogen as a fuel.  Dominovas Energy considers that its SOFC system enjoys advantages over these competing fuel cell technologies in that it accepts multiple fuel types. 

As a competitive advantage, fuel cells enjoy efficiency advantages over other common combustion fuel-utilizing power generating systems, providing up to 55% efficiency without counting additional efficiencies of waste heat utilization.  Other systems have lower efficiencies: thermoelectric generator (3-4%), engine driven generator (15-25%), gas turbine generator (20-25%) and steam turbine generator (25-35%).

OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Dominovas Energy Corporation has engaged the opportunity to support and deploy a  NextGen  clean energy, maximally-efficient, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) as perfected via its proprietary system and  Intelligent Communications Operating System  (ICOS), coupled with our unparalleled and advanced knowledge of fuel cells, that will allow the manufacturing of what we know will be  THE  fuel cell standard of fuel cell systems worldwide. 

Emerging markets globally are facing major challenges with the current state of their energy infrastructure, even as their economies continue growing at trajectory rates. Dominovas Energy and the various country leaders that have been engaged agree that the provision of technologically-advanced and advanced energy infrastructure will play a crucial role in facilitating their respective country's continued expectation, relative to strong economic growth domestically and continued global competitiveness. 

The first step in the process is to examine and analyze the current "State of Energy" in the various emerging markets around the world. With site visits to Africa and through additional research, Dominovas Energy has identified key partners and has created strategies to capture sizable market share of the power generation industry. Dominovas Energy's early missions have been quite successful and cumulated in its obtaining Letters of Interest or Memorandum of Understanding for the deployment of multiple MWs. 

Most recently, Dominovas Energy was humbled by the openness and sincerity displayed and shared by the government during its site visits to Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, and South Africa.  Increasingly, Dominovas Energy is given the opportunity to present its technology solution that has the overwhelming potential to positively affect countries on an epic scale.  Key has been the relationship that Dominovas Energy has with key decision and policy makers that openly have exhibited the willingness to acknowledge the problem that severely threatens the viability of their countries.  This truly speaks volumes about the strength and courage of these leaders we are currently engaging. 

Through research and interviews, the Company has found that governments of countries in emerging markets spend an enormous amount on fuel stock for their own power generation plants and/or third party electricity generation plants, which in turn convert the fuel to electricity and release the electricity to the grid.  A critical disconnect within the system, however, lies in the fact that as a result of degradation to the existing transmission infrastructure, on average approximately 60% of the power generated reaches end users. 

The energy generators sole responsibility is to create the energy. Typically, the government has the responsibility of collecting payment for the energy that has been generated and consumed. This places the government in an untenable position between the number of those legally receiving energy and not paying, along with the rate of those "diverting" electricity at over 40% small numbers individually, but collectively the numbers account for millions of dollars a year in lost revenue and unintended subsidies. 

Dominovas Energy's "Distributed Power Solution" drastically reduces the immediate need to upgrade transmission infrastructure due to the RUBICON'S(TM) ability to be deployed where it is needed and not rely on long and expensive transmission lines. The RUBICON'S(TM) modular design, relatively small footprint, quiet nature, and low carbon foot print make it a perfect candidate for being deployed in center city, residential, and/or industrial settings. Dominovas Energy expects that the deployment of the RUBICON(TM) will successfully address the concerns relative to the immediacy in the need for power, without sacrificing quality of life. 

The RUBICON(TM) additionally is expected to provide significant returns for shareholders due to its intent to enter into long-term profitable contracts. In fact, the RUBICON(TM) brings many options to the table that were, heretofore, not possible because the technological advances had not been made to allow for such opportunities. For example, because the RUBICON(TM) has the unique ability to function utilizing multiple fuel sources, there is a great opportunity to revitalize and expand into the mining, agricultural, and industrial sectors to levels never witnessed before; the potential benefit is to be able to provide reliable electricity more efficiently to the mining sector and the remediation of the bio waste that can now be used as fuel for entire countries. 

For emerging markets, the impact nets the following: self-sufficiency in energy and job creation, savings in fuel costs, decreased emissions, and overall improved quality of life. This is made possible because of the efficiencies of the RUBICON(TM) and the inefficiencies of other technologies, coupled with the inadequacies and shortcomings of the current distribution system now in place in most emerging countries. 

22 

The cornerstones upon which Dominovas Energy confidently and without reservation feels it can and will effectuate change of epic proportion across the globe, when given the opportunity are: 

Modular energy systems that allow for unparalleled efficiencies. 

Unrivaled Affordability Creating a True "ROI." 

Create the Fuel Cell Universe in Africa, for worldwide development, manufacturing, distribution, and new technology research. 

All energy options are not created equal. The exigent nature of emerging markets' energy needs should not create a situation, whereby, the immediate need is tempered and the problem not solved, but exacerbated. Current options are problematic in that many solutions are insufficient and create results of a greater magnitude. 

Several targeted countries are currently seeking to add coal-fired, hydropower, wind, and solar plants. Fuel cell generated power is a great complement to any country's sustainable power generation plan. It is our stance that there is not one solution that fits all scenarios, but the RUBICON(TM) is definitely a solution that is robust, clean, and can be deployed profitably. 

Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

LIQUIDITY 

ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS 

Over the next year, we have estimated our minimum cash requirements as follows: 

Operating Expenses 

For the year ended August 31, 2016, we recorded a net operating loss $(3,711,583). As of August 31, 2016, we had cash of $13,846 and for the next year, management estimates minimum cash requirements of $3,265,000 to fund our on-going operations and planned fuel cell design, manufacture and business development activities. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient funds to meet our plan of operation over the next year and will need to obtain further financing. 

Our financial condition for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows: 

WORKING CAPITAL 

Our working capital position as of August 31, 2016 compared to August 31, 2015 and the cash flows for the twelve months then ended are summarized below: 

23 

The increase in our working capital deficiency was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 which are included herein. 

The following is a summary of our results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2016 and 2015: 

24 

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA. 

REVENUE 

We have not earned any revenues since our inception and we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have deployed the initial RUBICON(TM) fuel cell power plants under a long-term agreement. We are currently in the early stage of our business and we can provide no assurances that we will sign a long-term agreement. 

EXPENSES 

Our operating expenses for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 decreased by the net amount of $3,550,130 primarily due to salaries, office and management fees expenses.  

GOING CONCERN 

The audited financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our Company has not generated revenues since inception, has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon: (i) the continued financial support from our shareholders; (ii) the ability of our Company to continue raising necessary equity financing to achieve its operating objectives; and (iii) the eventual attainment of profitable operations. As of August 31, 2016, our Company has a negative working capital of $2,934,670. 

25 

Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their annual report on our financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our financial statements contain further note disclosures in this regard. The continuation of our business plan is dependent upon our ability to continue raising sufficient new capital from equity or debt markets in order to fund our on-going operating losses and fuel cell manufacturing and sales activities. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. 

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("US") and are expressed in US dollars. The Company is a development stage company as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 7, "Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises" and has not realized any revenues from its planned operations to date. 

USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are readily apparent from other sources.  The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially from the Company's estimates.  To the extent there are material differences, future results may be affected. 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, notes payable and convertible debentures.  It is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.  The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States Dollars at the period-end exchange rates.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historical rates in effect when the assets were acquired or obligations incurred.  Transactions occurring during the period are translated at rates in effect at the time of the transaction. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operations. 

INCOME TAXES 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the Company determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation.  A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.  The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. 

26 

LOSS PER SHARE 

The Company computes net loss per share of both basic and diluted loss per share ("LPS") on the face of the statement of operations.  Basic LPS is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.  Diluted LPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period, including convertible debt, stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method.  The computation of diluted LPS does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on LPS. 

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Other than reported net income (loss), comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, which are disclosed in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' deficit as comprehensive income (loss). 

LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. 

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 

The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". SFAS No. 143 requires the Company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs an obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of these assets. At August 31, 2014, the Company has not recognized any amount for asset retirement obligations. 

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company has adopted the fair value recognition policy, whereby compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments based on the fair value at monthly vesting dates, estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. 

All transactions in which goods and services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.  Equity instruments issued to Advisory Board members and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. 

On April 14, 2010, our shareholders approved our 2010 Equity Compensation Plan.  Under the 2010 Plan, options may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants as determined by our board of directors.  Pursuant to the 2010 Plan, we reserved for issuance up to 5,000,000 shares of our outstanding common stock under the 2010 plan.  However no options have been granted as of August 31, 2016; and therefore, no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date for stock options. 

27 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Recent pronouncements with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the financial statement of the Company. 

SEC'S FINAL RULE ON OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 

On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission, referred to in this report as the SEC, issued Release No. 33-8995, "Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule)," which revises the disclosures required by oil and gas companies. The SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas companies have been updated to include expanded disclosure for oil and gas activities, and certain definitions have also been changed that will impact the determination of oil and gas reserve quantities. The provisions of this final rule are effective for registration statements filed on or after January 1, 2010, and for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Dominovas Energy Corporation 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dominovas Energy Corporation (the  Company ) as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, based on these audits, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dominovas Energy Corporation as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has not generated revenues since inception, has incurred losses in developing its business, and further losses are anticipated. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's plans in this regard are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

(Expressed in US dollars) 

1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Dominovas Energy Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated on February 2, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada and is in the business of developing fuel cell and alternative energy projects. 

On February 20, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of Dominovas Energy LLC. (the  Subsidiary ), which is developing a fuel cell system.  On February 24, 2014, the Subsidiary changed its name to Dominovas Technologies LLC ( Dominovas Technologies ). 

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has not achieved profitable operations and has accumulated a deficit of $17,528,523. Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due and ultimately upon its ability to achieve profitable operations. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These adjustments could be material. Management intends to obtain additional funding by borrowing funds from its directors and officers, issuing promissory notes and convertible debt and/or a private placement of common stock. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dominovas Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dominovas Technologies. On consolidation, all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. 

USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the  circumstances, the results of which form the basis from making judgments about the carrying values of assets and  liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

Foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Related translation adjustments as well as gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported as a component of general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

The Company uses the temporal method to translate the accounts of its integrated operations into US dollars.  Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period, except for amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related asset.  The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized in net loss. 

34 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASURES 

ASC 820, "Fair Value  Measurements  and  Disclosures"  ("ASC 820"),  requires an entity  to  maximize  the  use of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the use of unobservable  inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.  A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: 

Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: 

Level 2 applies to assets or  liabilities  for which there are inputs other than quoted  prices that are  observable  for the asset or  liability  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  in active  markets;  quoted prices for identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  with  insufficient   volume  or infrequent  transactions (less active markets);  or model-derived  valuations in which significant  inputs are observable or can be derived  principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3: 

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are no observable inputs to the valuation methodology that are relevant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, notes payable, and convertible debt. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash and convertible notes are determined based on "Level 1" inputs.  The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 

INCOME TAXES 

Income tax expense is based on pre-tax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carry forwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

LOSS PER SHARE 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per common share includes the potential dilution that could occur upon exercise of the options, and convertible notes to acquire common stock computed using the treasury stock method which assumes that the increase in the number of shares is reduced by the number of shares which could have been repurchased by the Company with the proceeds from the exercise of the options, and convertible notes.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

The following are recent FASB accounting pronouncements, which may have an impact on the Company's future financial statements: 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   This ASU is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Our Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our company's assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America, and that our Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2015 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management has concluded that, as of August 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Our management reviewed the results of their assessment with our Board of Directors. 

This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit our company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS 

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended August 31, 2016 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Certificates with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting under Rules 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act are attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. 

Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with, with the exception of the following:

CODE OF ETHICS 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics as falls under our adopted Foreign Corruption and Practices Act directive and as such all employees have executed same. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

None of our directors are independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. We do not have a standing Nominating, Compensation or Audit Committee. 

NOMINATING COMMITTEE 

We do not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. Our board of directors believe that it is not necessary to have a standing compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee are adequately performed by our board of directors. 

Our board of directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for us not to have a standing nominating committee because our board of directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of a nominating committee. Our board of directors has not adopted a charter for the nomination committee. There has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. Our board of directors does not believe that a defined policy with regard to the consideration of candidates recommended by stockholders is necessary at this time because we believe that, given the early stages of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations are at a more advanced level. There are no specific, minimum qualifications that our board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by our board of directors. The process of identifying and evaluating nominees for director typically begins with our board of directors soliciting professional firms with whom we have an existing business relationship, such as law firms, accounting firms or financial advisory firms, for suitable candidates to serve as directors. It is followed by our board of directors' review of the candidates' resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, our board of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. We do not pay any fee to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee. 

A shareholder who wishes to recommend nominees to our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Neal Allen, 1395 Chattahoochee Ave; Atlanta, Ga 30318. 

AUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT 

We do not have a standing audit committee at the present time. Our board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a board member that qualifies as "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

We believe that an audit committee, including at least one independent director, is an important part of the normal process of oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls over financial reporting. However, we believe this would be too costly and burdensome and is not completely warranted in our circumstances given the early stage of our development; the fact we have not generated any revenues from operations to date; and funding resources are limited. In the meantime, we believe our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures over financial reporting. 

49 

OTHER COMMITTEES 

All proceedings of our board of directors for the year ended August 31, 2014 were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by our directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board of directors. Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of directors believes it is not necessary to have such committees for the reasons indicated above. 

Our Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. Our directors believe that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our board of directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Neal Allen, 1395 Chattahoochee Ave; Atlanta, Ga 30318.

In the following tables, we have determined the number and percentage of shares beneficially owned in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act based on information provided to us by our controlling shareholder, executive officers and directors, and this information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. In determining the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we include any shares as to which the person has sole or shared voting power or investment power, as well as any shares subject to warrants or options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. 

CHANGES IN CONTROL 

None. 

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

None of the following parties has, since our date of incorporation, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction with us or in any presently proposed transaction that has or will materially affect us, other than as noted in this section: 

(i) 

Any of our directors or officers; 

(ii) 

Any person proposed as a nominee for election as a director; 

(iii) 

Any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to our outstanding shares of common stock; 

(iv) 

Any of our promoters; and 

(v) 

Any member of the immediate family (including spouse, parents, children, siblings and in- laws) of any of the foregoing persons. 

PENSION, RETIREMENT OR SIMILAR BENEFIT PLANS 

There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have no material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. 

53 

We have no plans or arrangements in respect of remuneration received or that may be received by our executive officers to compensate such officers in the event of termination of employment (as a result of resignation, retirement, change of control) or a change of responsibilities following a change of control, where the value of such compensation exceeds $60,000 per executive officer. 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

AUDIT FEES 

For the years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, the aggregate fees billed by Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton Labonte LLP for professional services rendered for the quarterly reviews and annual audit of our consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10Q and our annual report on Form 10-K were: 

POLICY ON PRE-APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE OF SERVICES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 

We do not use Dale Matheson for financial information system design and implementation. These services, which include designing or implementing a system that aggregates source data underlying the financial statements or generates information that is significant to our financial statements, are provided internally or by other service providers. We do not engage Dale Matheson to provide compliance outsourcing services. 

Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before Dale Matheson is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be: 

approved by our audit committee (which consists of our entire board of directors); or 

entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the board of directors, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the board of directors is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the board of directors' responsibilities to management. 

The board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered. 

The board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by Dale Matheson and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining Dale Matheson's independence.
