EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   of SL Green Realty Corp. and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "SL Green Realty Corp.," the "Company" or "SL Green" mean SL Green Realty Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to "SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P.," the "Operating Partnership" or "SLGOP" mean SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms "we," "our" and "us" mean the Company and all the entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
  The Company is a Maryland corporation which operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and is the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Operating Partnership.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   95.71%   of the outstanding general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling investors held, in aggregate, a   4.29%   limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company also owns 9,200,000 Series I Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership. We refer to these interests as the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership.  
  The Company and the Operating Partnership are managed and operated as one entity. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. The Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are substantially the same.  
  Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, stockholders' equity of the Company and partners' capital of the Operating Partnership are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company are accounted for as noncontrolling interests, within mezzanine equity, in the Company's and the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
  We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
             
    Combined reports enhance investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
                
    Combined reports eliminate duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
                
    Combined reports create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
     To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership:  
             
    consolidated financial statements; 
                
    the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
                
    Note 11, Noncontrolling Interests on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements; 
                
    Note 12, Stockholders' Equity of the Company; 
                
    Note 13, Partners' Capital of the Operating Partnership; 
       
  This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership, respectively, in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, in both their capacity as the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, have made the requisite certifications and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
  SL Green Realty Corp., which is referred to as the Company or SL Green, a Maryland corporation, and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., which is referred to as SLGOP or the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of combining the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc. and its affiliated partnerships and entities. The Operating Partnership received a contribution of interest in the real estate properties, as well as   95%   of the economic interest in the management, leasing and construction companies which are referred to as the Service Corporation. All of the management, leasing and construction services that are provided to the properties that are wholly-owned by us and that are provided to certain joint ventures are conducted through SL Green Management LLC which is   100%   owned by the Operating Partnership. The Company has qualified, and expects to qualify in the current fiscal year, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and operates as a self-administered, self-managed REIT. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to minimize the payment of Federal income taxes at the corporate level. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our" and "us" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
  Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of   September 30, 2016  , noncontrolling investors held, in the aggregate, a   4.29%   limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. We refer to these interests as the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is considered a variable interest entity, or VIE, in which we are the primary beneficiary. See Note 11, "Noncontrolling Interests on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements".  
  Reckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P., or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SL Green Realty Corp. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned the following interests in properties in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which are collectively known as the Suburban properties: 

(1) 
    The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total occupied square feet divided by the total acquisition square footage.  The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by the total available units.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.) 
  September 30, 2016 

(2) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a building that was comprised of approximately   270,132   square feet (unaudited) of retail space and approximately   222,855   square feet (unaudited) of residential space. For the purpose of this report, we have included the building in the retail properties count and have bifurcated the square footage into the retail and residential components. 
      As of   September 30, 2016  , we also managed an office building of approximately   336,000   square foot (unaudited), which is owned by a third party and held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of   $1.8 billion  , including   $0.3 billion   of debt and preferred equity investments and other financing receivables that are included in other balance sheet line items.  
  Partnership Agreement 
  In accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, or the Operating Partnership Agreement, we allocate all distributions and profits and losses in proportion to the percentage of ownership interests of the respective partners. As the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, we are required to take such reasonable efforts, as determined by us in our sole discretion, to cause the Operating Partnership to distribute sufficient amounts to enable the payment of sufficient dividends by us to minimize any Federal income or excise tax at the Company level. Under the Operating Partnership Agreement, each limited partner has the right to redeem units of limited partnership interests for cash, or if we so elect, shares of SL Green's common stock on a one-for-  one   basis. 
  Basis of Quarterly Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position of the Company and the Operating Partnership at   September 30, 2016   and the results of operations for the periods presented have been included. The operating results for the period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   of the Company and the Operating Partnership. 
  The consolidated balance sheets at   December 31, 2015   have been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. 
   
  2. Significant Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned or controlled by us. Entities which we do not control through our voting interest and entities which are variable interest entities, but where we are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments" and Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures." All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
  We consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, in which we are considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Included in commercial real estate properties on our consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $1.6 billion   and   $200.7 million  , respectively, related to our consolidated VIEs. Included in mortgages and other loans payable on our consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $605.8 million   and   $101.1 million  , respectively, collateralized by the real estate assets of the related consolidated VIEs. As of   September 30, 2016  , assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets did not include amounts related to consolidated VIEs.      
  A noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us. Noncontrolling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet and the presentation of net income is modified to present earnings and other comprehensive income attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests. 
  We assess the accounting treatment for each joint venture and debt and preferred equity investment. This assessment includes a review of each joint venture or limited liability company agreement to determine which party has what rights and whether those  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  
  SL Green Realty Corp. and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.) 
  September 30, 2016 

rights are protective or participating. For all VIEs, we review such agreements in order to determine which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. In situations where we and our partner approve, among other things, the annual budget, receive a detailed monthly reporting package, meet on a quarterly basis to review the results of the joint venture, review and approve the joint venture's tax return before filing, and approve all leases that cover more than a nominal amount of space relative to the total rentable space at each property, we do not consolidate the joint venture as we consider these to be substantive participation rights that result in shared power of the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the joint venture. Our joint venture agreements typically contain certain protective rights such as requiring partner approval to sell, finance or refinance the property and the payment of capital expenditures and operating expenditures outside of the approved budget or operating plan. 
  Investment in Commercial Real Estate Properties 
  On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be other than temporarily impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property.  
  We also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of either their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We do not believe that there were any indicators of impairment at any of our consolidated properties at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We allocate the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. We depreciate the amount allocated to building (inclusive of tenant improvements) over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from   three   to   40 years  . We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases  over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from   one   to   14   years, and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from   one   to   14   years. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period. 
  We recognized   $(0.2) million   and   $191.4 million   of rental revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $10.2 million   and   $32.9 million   of rental revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   for the amortization of aggregate below-market leases in excess of above-market leases and a reduction in lease origination costs, resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties. Included in rental revenue is   zero   and   $172.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for the amortization of the below-market lease at 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of the tenant exercising their option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized as a reduction to interest expense the amortization of the above-market rate mortgages assumed of   $0.7 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized as a reduction to interest expense the amortization of the above-market rate mortgages assumed of   $0.6 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively.

The following summarizes our identified intangible assets (acquired above-market leases and in-place leases) and intangible liabilities (acquired below-market leases) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively and   $0.8 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, of net intangible assets and net intangible liabilities, were reclassified to assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale. 
     In February 2016, we closed on the sale of 885 Third Avenue but did not meet the criteria for sale accounting under the full accrual method in ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sales. As a result the property remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the criteria is met. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  See Note 16, "Fair Value Measurements." 
  Investment in Marketable Securities 
  We designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading at acquisition. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any securities designated as held-to-maturity or trading. We account for our available-for-sale securities at fair value pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 820-10, with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Any unrealized losses that are determined to be other-than-temporary are recognized in earnings up to their credit component. 
  The cost of bonds and marketable securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held the following marketable securities (in thousands): 

The cost basis of the commercial mortgage-backed securities was   $36.1 million   and   $38.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These securities mature at various times through 2049. 
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we disposed of marketable securities for aggregate net proceeds of   $1.7 million   and   $6.9 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we disposed of marketable securities for aggregate net proceeds of   $0.1 million  , and   $0.4 million  , respectively. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  We assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint ventures' projected discounted cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction, where we expect to receive some of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with our loan accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments.

Revenue Recognition 
  Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. In order for the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use. To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, management evaluates whether we are or the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes. When management concludes that we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such tenant improvements are substantially complete. In certain instances, when management concludes that we are not the owner (the tenant is the owner) of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space. When management concludes that we are the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record amounts funded to construct the tenant improvements as a capital asset. For these tenant improvements, we record amounts reimbursed by tenants as a reduction of the capital asset. When management concludes that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred costs, net on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. We establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future potential tenant credit losses, which may occur against this account. The balance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is net of such allowance. 
  In addition to base rent, our tenants also generally will pay their pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for the building over a base year. In some leases, in lieu of paying additional rent based upon increases in building operating expenses, the tenant will pay additional rent based upon increases in the wage rate paid to porters over the porters' wage rate in effect during a base year or increases in the consumer price index over the index value in effect during a base year. In addition, many of our leases contain fixed percentage increases over the base rent to cover escalations. Electricity is most often supplied by the landlord either on a sub-metered basis, or rent inclusion basis (i.e., a fixed fee is included in the rent for electricity, which amount may increase based upon increases in electricity rates or increases in electrical usage by the tenant). Base building services other than electricity (such as heat, air conditioning and freight elevator service during business hours, and base building cleaning) are typically provided at no additional cost, with the tenant paying additional rent only for services which exceed base building services or for services which are provided outside normal business hours. These escalations are based on actual expenses incurred in the prior calendar year. If the expenses in the current year are different from those in the prior year, then during the current year, the escalations will be adjusted to reflect the actual expenses for the current year. 
  We record a gain on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer, subject to the buyer's financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and provided that we have no substantial economic involvement with the buyer. 
  Interest income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when, in the opinion of management, it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt. 
  Deferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to the interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. Discounts or premiums associated with the purchase of loans are amortized or accreted into interest income as a yield adjustment on the effective interest method based on expected cashflows through the expected maturity date of the related investment. If we purchase a debt or preferred equity investment at a discount, intend to hold it until maturity and expect to recover the full value of the investment, we accrete the discount into income as an adjustment to yield over the term of the investment. If we purchase a debt or preferred equity investment at a discount with the intention of foreclosing on the collateral, we do not accrete the discount. For debt investments acquired at a discount for credit quality, the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows at acquisition is not accreted. Anticipated exit fees, the collection of which is expected, are also recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. 
  Debt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become   90   days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition on any non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is resumed when such non-accrual debt or preferred equity

investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Interest is recorded as income on impaired loans only to the extent cash is received. 
  We may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we derecognize the loan sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income. 
  Asset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement. 
  Reserve for Possible Credit Losses 
  The expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt and preferred equity investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that we estimate to be adequate, based on Level 3 data, considering delinquencies, loss experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered include geographic trends, product diversification, the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions. Based upon these factors, we establish a provision for possible credit loss on each individual investment. When it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, the investment is considered impaired. 
  Where impairment is indicated on an investment that is held to maturity, a valuation allowance is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral. Any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the calculated value of the collateral is charged to expense. We continue to assess or adjust our estimates based on circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral. If additional information reflects increased recovery of our investment, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. There were no loan reserves recorded during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Debt and preferred equity investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its net carrying value to debt and preferred equity investments held to maturity. For these reclassified investments, the difference between the current carrying value and the expected cash to be collected at maturity will be accreted into income over the remaining term of the investment. 
  Income Taxes 
  SL Green is taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Code. As a REIT, SL Green generally is not subject to Federal income tax. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, SL Green must distribute at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain other requirements. If SL Green fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, SL Green will be subject to Federal income tax on SL Green's taxable income at regular corporate rates. SL Green may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes. Under certain circumstances, Federal income and excise taxes may be due on SL Green's undistributed taxable income. 
  The Operating Partnership is a partnership and, as a result, all income and losses of the partnership are allocated to the partners for inclusion in their respective income tax returns. The only provision for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations relates to the Operating Partnership s consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes. 
  Pursuant to amendments to the Code that became effective January 1, 2001, we have elected, and may elect in the future, to treat certain of our existing or newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. In general, TRSs may perform non-customary services for the tenants of the Company, hold assets that we cannot hold directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. The TRSs generate income, resulting in Federal and state income tax liability for these entities. 
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded Federal, state and local tax provisions of   $0.9 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded Federal, state and local tax provisions of   $1.1 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. 
  We follow a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination.  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.) 
  September 30, 2016 

Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited. 
  Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans 
  We have a stock-based employee compensation plan, described more fully in Note 14, "Share-based Compensation." 
  The Company's stock options are recorded at fair value at the time of issuance. Fair value of the stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our plan has characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. 
  Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Our policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the quoted closing market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Awards of stock or restricted stock are expensed as compensation over the benefit period based on the fair value of the stock on the grant date. 
  For share-based awards with a performance or market measure, we recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period, using the accelerated attribution expense method. The requisite service period begins on the date the compensation committee of SL Green's board of directors authorizes the award, adopts any relevant performance measures and communicates the award to the employees. For programs with awards that vest based on the achievement of a performance condition or market condition, we determine whether it is probable that the performance condition will be met, and estimate compensation cost based on the fair value of the award at the applicable reporting date estimated using a binomial model or market quotes. For share-based awards for which there is no pre-established performance measure, we recognize compensation cost over the service vesting period, which represents the requisite service period, on a straight-line basis. In accordance with the provisions of our share-based incentive compensation plans, we accept the return of shares of the Company's common stock, at the current quoted market price, from certain key employees to satisfy minimum statutory tax-withholding requirements related to shares that vested during the period. 
  Awards can also be made in the form of a separate series of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership called long-term incentive plan units, or LTIP units. LTIP units, which can be granted either as free-standing awards or in tandem with other awards under our stock incentive plan, are valued by reference to the value of the Company's common stock at the time of grant, and are subject to such conditions and restrictions as the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors may determine, including continued employment or service, computation of financial metrics and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. 
  Earnings per Share of the Company 
  The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share, or EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic EPS includes participating securities, consisting of unvested restricted stock that receive nonforfeitable dividends similar to shares of common stock. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS amount. Diluted EPS also includes units of limited partnership interest. The dilutive effect of stock options is reflected in the weighted average diluted outstanding shares calculation by application of the treasury stock method. There is no dilutive effect for the exchangeable senior notes as the conversion premium will be paid in cash. 
  Earnings per Unit of the Operating Partnership 
  The Operating Partnership presents both basic and diluted earnings per unit, or EPU. Basic EPU excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to common unitholders by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period. Basic EPU includes participating securities, consisting of unvested restricted units that receive nonforfeitable dividends similar to shares of common units. Diluted EPU reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common units were exercised or converted into common units, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPU amount. The dilutive effect of unit options is reflected in the weighted average diluted outstanding units calculation by application of the treasury stock method. There is no dilutive effect for the exchangeable senior notes as the conversion premium will be paid in cash.

Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments, debt and preferred equity investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash investments in excess of insured amounts with high quality financial institutions. The collateral securing our debt and preferred equity investments is located in New York City. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments." We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants and require most tenants to provide security deposits or letters of credit. Though these security deposits and letters of credit are insufficient to meet the total value of a tenant's lease obligation, they are a measure of good faith and a source of funds to offset the economic costs associated with lost revenue and the costs associated with re-tenanting a space. The properties in our real estate portfolio are primarily located in Manhattan. We also have properties located in Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey. The tenants located in our buildings operate in various industries. Other than   two   tenants, who account for   7.8%   and   6.8%   of our share of annualized cash rent, no other tenant in our portfolio accounted for more than   5.0%   of our share of annualized cash rent, including our share of joint venture annualized rent, at   September 30, 2016  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   9.7%  ,   7.9%  ,   7.5%  ,   6.6%  ,   5.7%  , and   5.1%   of our share of annualized cash rent for consolidated properties was attributable to 1515 Broadway, 919 Third Avenue, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 420 Lexington Avenue, One Madison Avenue and 485 Lexington Avenue, respectively. Annualized cash rent for all other consolidated properties was below   5.0%  . 
  Reclassification 
  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation. 
  Accounting Standards Updates 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The ASU provides final guidance on eight cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investees, separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle, and others. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The guidance changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income.  The guidance replaces the current  incurred loss  model with an  expected loss  approach. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted after December 2018. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323). The guidance eliminates the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2016 and interim periods within those years.

Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under the previous standard. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the previous standard. The Guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASU825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The guidance requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and to record changes in instruments-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option in other comprehensive income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods  therein.  The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued final guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability (ASU 2015-03). The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2016. Accordingly, as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   $101.5 million   and   $130.3 million  , respectively, of deferred debt issuance cost, net of amortization are presented as a direct reduction within Mortgages and other loans payable, Revolving credit facility, Term loan and senior unsecured notes on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance that amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities (ASU 2015-02). Under this analysis, limited partnerships and other similar entities will be considered a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2016. Under the revised guidance, certain entities, including the Operating Partnership, now qualify as variable interest entities while some of our entities originally classified as variable interest entities no longer meet the criteria.  The change in designation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and did not change the consolidation conclusion on these entities. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new comprehensive revenue recognition guidance which requires us to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services (ASU 2014-09). The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued implementation guidance which clarifies principal versus agent considerations in reporting revenue gross versus net (ASU 2016-08).  
  In April 2016, the FASB issued implementation guidance which clarifies the identification of performance obligations (ASU 2016-10).  
  In April 2016, the FASB amended its new revenue recognition guidance on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial and clarify when a good or service is separately identifiable (ASU 2016-10). 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued implementation guidance relating to transition, collectability, noncash consideration and presentation matters (ASU 2016-12). 
  These ASUs are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is  permitted, but not before interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company has not yet adopted this guidance and is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.

2015 Acquisitions 
  During   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we finalized the purchase price allocations based on facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition dates for the following 2015 acquisitions (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Based on our preliminary analysis of the purchase price, we had allocated   $22.1 million   and   $41.0 million   to land and building, respectively, at 187 Broadway and 5   7 Dey Street,   $89.3 million   and   $165.8 million   to land and building, respectively, at 110 Greene Street,   $17.5 million   and   $32.5 million   to land and building, respectively, at the Upper Eastside Residential Property,   $849.9 million   and   $1.6 billion   to land and building, respectively, at 11 Madison Avenue, and   $6.1 million   and   $0.7 million   to land and building, respectively, at 1640 Flatbush Avenue. The impact to our consolidated statement of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to adjust for the finalized purchase price allocations was   $8.0 million   in rental revenue for the amortization of aggregate below-market leases and   $17.9 million   of depreciation expense. 

4. Properties Held for Sale and Property Dispositions 
  Properties Held for Sale 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we determined that the held for sale criteria was met for 400 East 57th Street. In October we closed on the sale of a   49%   interest in the property, in which we previously held a   90%   interest.

Property Dispositions  
  The following table summarizes the properties sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Sales price represents the gross sales price for a property or the gross asset valuation for interests in a property. 
              (2) 
    The gain on sale for 248-252 Bedford Avenue and 388 Greenwich are net of   $1.3 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively in employee compensation awards accrued in connection with the realization of the investment gain as a bonus to certain employees that were instrumental in realizing the gain on sale.  Additionally, amounts do not include adjustments for expenses recorded in subsequent periods. 
              (3) 
    In February 2016, we closed on the sale of 885 Third Avenue. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting and, as a result, the property remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the criteria is met. An estimated loss relating to the sale of   $6.6 million   was recorded in December 2015. We expect to meet the criteria for sale accounting in 2017 at which time we will recognize the sale and start recognizing investment income on our   $135.0 million     5.75%   senior equity investment in the property. 
              (4) 
    In August 2016, we sold an   40%   interest in 11 Madison Avenue. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting and, as a result, the property is being accounted for under the profit sharing method. See Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures." 
     Discontinued Operations 
  The Company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which raised the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations to include only dispositions that represent a strategic shift in an entity s operations. The guidance was applied prospectively for new disposals.  As a result, the results of operations for 400 East 57th Street, which was classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016 along with 570-574 Fifth Avenue and 140-150 Grand Street, which were classified as held for sale at September 30, 2015, are included in continuing operations for all periods presented. 
  Discontinued operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included the results of operations of 180 Maiden Lane, which was held for sale at December 31, 2014 and sold in January 2015, as follows (in thousands): 

5. Debt and Preferred Equity Investments 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our debt and preferred equity investments, net of discounts and deferred origination fees, increased   $590.4 million   and   $464.9 million  , respectively, due to originations, purchases, advances under future funding obligations, discount and fee amortization, and paid-in-kind interest, net of premium amortization. We recorded repayments, participations and sales of   $807.2 million   and   $372.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which offset the increases in debt and preferred equity investments.

  Debt Investments 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   we held the following debt investments with an aggregate weighted average current yield of   9.29%   at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

    Carrying value is net of discounts, premiums, original issue discounts and deferred origination fees. 
              (2) 
    Represents contractual maturity, excluding any unexercised extension options. 
              (3) 
    Carrying value is net of the following amounts that were participated out, which are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the transfers not meeting the conditions for sale accounting: (a)   $41.3 million  , (b)   $5.0 million  , (c)   $12.0 million  , (d)   $36.3 million  , (e)   $14.5 million  , (f)   $14.6 million  , (g)   $14.1 million  , and (h)   $5.1 million  . 
              (4) 
    In September 2014, we acquired a   $26.4 million   mortgage loan at a   $0.2 million   discount and a   $5.7 million   junior mortgage participation at a   $5.7 million   discount. The junior mortgage participation was a nonperforming loan at acquisition and is currently on non-accrual status. 
               (6) 
    In April 2016, we closed on an option to acquire a   20%   interest in the underlying asset at a previously agreed upon purchase option valuation, and our mezzanine loan was simultaneously repaid. 
               (8) 
    These loans were collateralized by defeasance securities. 
                   (14) 
    In March 2016, we contributed our interest in the loan in exchange for a joint venture interest which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting. It is included in unconsolidated joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheets.

Preferred Equity Investments 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , we held the following preferred equity investments with an aggregate weighted average current yield of   7.32%   at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Carrying value is net of deferred origination fees. 
                   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all debt and preferred equity investments were performing in accordance with the terms of the relevant investments, with the exception of a junior mortgage participation acquired in September 2014, which has a carrying value of   zero  . 
  We have determined that we have   one   portfolio segment of financing receivables at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   comprising commercial real estate which is primarily recorded in debt and preferred equity investments. Included in other assets is an additional amount of financing receivables totaling   $101.4 million   and   $121.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively.   No   financing receivables were 90 days past due at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  6. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  We have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners. As of   September 30, 2016  , 650 Fifth Avenue, 800 Third Avenue, 21 East 66th Street, 605 West 42   nd    Street, 333 East 22nd Street, and certain properties within the Stonehenge Portfolio are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our net equity investment in these VIEs was $  220.7   million as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  , 650 Fifth Avenue and 33 Beekman were VIEs in which we were not the primary beneficiary. Our net equity investment in these VIEs was   $39.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . Our maximum loss is limited to the amount of our equity investment in these VIEs. All other investments below are voting interest entities. As we do not control the joint ventures listed below, we account for them under the equity method of accounting.

  September 30, 2016 

The table below provides general information on each of our joint ventures as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Acquisition price represents the actual or implied gross purchase price for the joint venture, which is not adjusted for subsequent acquisitions of additional interests. 
               (3) 
    As a result of the sale of a condominium interest in September 2012, Young   Rubicam, Inc., or Y R, owns floors three through eight at the property. Because the joint venture has an option to repurchase these floors, the gain associated with this sale was deferred. 
              (4) 
    The purchase price represents only the purchase of the 1552 Broadway interest which comprised approximately   13,045   square feet. The joint venture also owns a long-term leasehold interest in the retail space and certain other spaces at 1560 Broadway, which is adjacent to 1552 Broadway. 
              (5) 
    We hold a   32.28%   interest in   three   retail and   two   residential units at the property and a   16.14%   interest in   three   residential units at the property. 
              (6) 
    The joint venture owns a long-term leasehold interest in the retail space at 650 Fifth Avenue. In connection with the ground lease obligation, SLG provided a performance guaranty and our joint venture partner executed a contribution agreement to reflect its pro rata obligation. In the event the property is converted into a condominium unit and the landlord elects the purchase option, the joint venture shall be obligated to acquire the unit at the then fair value. 
              (7) 
    The joint venture owns   two   mezzanine notes secured by interests in the entity that owns 76 11th Avenue. The difference between our ownership interest and our economic interest results from our right to   50%   of the total exit fee while each of our partners is entitled to receive   25%   of the total exit fee. 
              (8) 
    The Company was granted an option to purchase the interest at an agreed upon valuation in July 2014 when it originated a   $50.0 million   mezzanine loan to  the project's developer. The mezzanine loan was repaid prior to the closing of the Company's acquisition of its joint venture interest. 
              (9) 
    In August 2016, we closed on the sale of a   40%   interest in 11 Madison.  The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting and as a result the property is being accounted for under the profit sharing method. Under the profit sharing method the Company recognizes its share of the operations of the property and also recognizes the other partner's share of depreciation. Included in equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures is   $4.7 million   of depreciation for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   representing the other partner's share of depreciation. Included in Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures at September 30, 2016 are   $2.7 billion   of assets net of   $1.5 billion   of liabilities, net of the   $482.0 million   consideration received at closing for this property. Sale accounting will be met upon the lender group consenting to certain modifications to the mortgage on the property which we expect

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.) 
  September 30, 2016 

will be granted during the fourth quarter of 2016. If the modification is not obtained this may result in the Company repurchasing the sold interest from PGIM Real Estate at the sale price. The achievement of sale accounting will discontinue recognition of PGIM Real Estate's share of depreciation from that date and will have no effect on the balance sheet presentation of the investment. 
           (10) 
    The joint venture entered into a ground lease for the property commencing in October 2016. 
       
  Acquisition, Development and Construction Arrangements 
  Based on the characteristics of the following arrangements, which are similar to those of an investment, combined with the expected residual profit of not greater than   50%  , we have accounted for these debt and preferred equity investments under the equity method. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the carrying value for acquisition, development and construction arrangements were as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    The Company has the ability to convert this loan into an equity position starting in 2021 and the borrower is able to force this conversion in 2024. 
              (2) 
    We have an option to convert our loan to an equity interest subject to certain conditions. We have determined that our option to convert the loan to equity is not a derivative financial instrument pursuant to GAAP.  
     Sale of Joint Venture Interest or Property 
  The following table summarizes the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures sold during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Represents implied gross valuation for the joint venture or sales price of the property.  
              (2) 
    Represents the Company's share of the gain. The gain on sale is net of   $1.1 million   employee compensation awards accrued in connection with the realization of these investment gains as a bonus to certain employees that were instrumental in realizing the gains on sale. 
               (4) 
    In connection with the sale of the property, we also recognized a promote of   $10.8 million  . 
     Mortgages and Other Loans Payable 
  We generally finance our joint ventures with non-recourse debt. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leases for tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. The first mortgage notes and other loans payable collateralized by the respective joint venture properties and assignment of leases at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are as follows (amounts in thousands):

    Effective weighted average interest rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , taking into account interest rate hedges in effect during the period. 
              (2) 
    These loans are comprised of a   $300.0 million   fixed rate mortgage loan and   $355.3 million   mezzanine loan. The mezzanine loan is subject to accretion based on the difference between contractual interest rate and contractual pay rate. 
                  (7) 
    We hold an   11.67%   non-controlling interest in the joint venture and the property secures a   two   year   $100.0 million   loan, of which   $77.0 million   is currently outstanding. 
       We act as the operating partner and day-to-day manager for all our joint ventures, except for 800 Third Avenue, Jericho Plaza, 280 Park Avenue, 3 Columbus Circle, 21 East 66th Street, 175-225 Third Street, 605 West 42nd Street and the Stonehenge Portfolio. We are entitled to receive fees for providing management, leasing, construction supervision and asset management services to certain of our joint ventures. We earned   $2.0 million   and   $4.5 million   from these services for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  We earned   $1.9 million   and   $6.8 million   from these services for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. In addition, we have the ability to earn incentive fees based on the ultimate financial performance of certain of the joint venture properties.

              (3) 
    In October 2016, we closed on the sale of an interest in 400 East 57th Street. At September 30, 2016, this property was classified as a held for sale property and the related mortgage, net of deferred financing costs, net of amortization of   $2.1 million  , was included in liabilities related to assets held for sale.

    In connection with the acquisition of a commercial real estate property, the Operating Partnership issued   $4.0 million  ,   3.75%   Series J Preferred Units of limited partnership interest, or the Series J Preferred Units, with a mandatory liquidation preference of   $1,000   per unit. The Series J Preferred Units are accounted for as debt because they can be redeemed in cash by the Operating Partnership on the earlier of (i) the date of the sale of the property or (ii) April 30, 2051 or at the option of the unitholders as provided for in the related agreement. 
              (5) 
    In February 2016, we closed on the sale of 885 Third Avenue. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting and as a result the property remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the criteria is met. The maturity date of the mortgage on the property, which was assumed by the buyer, is July 2017. 
              (6) 
    In August 2016, we closed on the sale of a   40.0%   interest on 11 Madison Avenue. This property is now classified within unconsolidated joint ventures. 
              (7) 
    In June 2016, we closed on the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street. At March 31, 2016, this property was classified as a held for sale property and the related mortgage, net of deferred financing costs, net of amortization of   $24.5 million  , was included in liabilities related to assets held for sale. 
               (9) 
    In September 2016, we closed on a   $1.5 billion   construction facility in connection with the development of One Vanderbilt Avenue. This facility bears interest at   350   basis points over 30-day LIBOR, with reductions based on meeting certain conditions, and has an initial   five  -year term with   two     one  -year extension options. Advances under the loan are subject to incurred costs, funded equity, loan to value thresholds, and entering into construction contracts.  
              (10) 
    The property at 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York was sold in February 2016. At December 31, 2015 this property was held for sale and the related mortgage, net of deferred financing, net of amortization costs of   $0.9 million  , was included in liabilities related to assets held for sale. 
       
  Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Facility 
  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, a New York licensed captive insurance company, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY.   As a member, Belmont may borrow funds from the FHLBNY in the form of secured advances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $229.0 million   in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of   0.90%  .  
  On January 12, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, adopted a final regulation on Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, membership.  The rule excludes captive insurance entities from FHLB membership on a going-forward basis and provides termination rules for current  captive insurance members.  Unless the final rule is modified, Belmont's membership will terminate on February 19, 2017, at which point we would be required to repay all funds borrowed from the FHLBNY. 
  Master Repurchase Agreement 
  The Master Repurchase Agreement, or MRA, provides us with the ability to sell certain debt investments with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same at a certain date or on demand. This MRA has a maximum facility capacity of   $300.0   million and bears interest ranging from   225   and   400   basis points over 30-day LIBOR depending on the pledged collateral. Since December 6, 2015, we have been required to pay monthly in arrears a   25   basis point fee on the excess of   $150.0 million   over the average daily balance during the period if the average daily balance is less than   $150.0 million  . We seek to mitigate risks associated with our repurchase agreement by managing the credit quality of our assets, early repayments, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and market value. The margin call provisions under our repurchase facility permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity, and are not limited to collateral-specific credit marks. To monitor credit risk associated with our debt investments, our asset management team regularly reviews our investment portfolio and is in contact with our borrowers in order to monitor the collateral and enforce our rights as necessary. The risk associated with potential margin calls is further mitigated by our ability to recollateralize the facility with additional assets from our portfolio of debt investments, our ability to satisfy margin calls with cash or cash equivalents and access to additional liquidity through the 2012 credit facility, as defined below.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the gross book value of the properties and debt and preferred equity investments collateralizing the mortgages and other loans payable, not including assets held for sale, was approximately   $6.4 billion   and   $10.8 billion  , respectively. 
   
  9. Corporate Indebtedness 
  2012 Credit Facility 
  In August 2016, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility that was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, referred to as the 2012 credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility, as amended, consisted of a   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility and a   $1.2 billion   term loan, with a maturity date of March 29, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The revolving credit facility has an as-of-right extension to March 29, 2020. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity under the revolving credit facility to   $3.0 billion   at any time prior to the maturity date for the revolving credit facility without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions.

Restrictive Covenants 
  The terms of the 2012 credit facility, as amended, and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that, we will not during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests, except to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we were in compliance with all such covenants.

  In June 2005, the Company and the Operating Partnership issued   $100.0 million   in unsecured trust preferred securities through a newly formed trust, SL Green Capital Trust I, or the Trust, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.

Interest payments may be deferred for a period of up to eight consecutive quarters if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to defer such payments. The Trust preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole or in part, with no prepayment premium. We do not consolidate the Trust even though it is a variable interest entity as we are not the primary beneficiary. Because the Trust is not consolidated, we have recorded the debt on our consolidated balance sheets and the related payments are classified as interest expense.

13. Partners' Capital of the Operating Partnership 
  The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and at   September 30, 2016   owned   100,264,253   general and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and   9,200,000   Series I Preferred Units. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated as  common units of limited partnership interest  (also referred to as  OP Units ) or  preferred units of limited partnership interest  (also referred to as  Preferred Units ). All references to OP Units and Preferred Units outstanding exclude such units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit in exchange for the cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company, except that the Company may, at its election, in lieu of cash redemption, acquire such OP Unit for one share of common stock. Because the number of shares of common stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, one share of common stock is generally the economic equivalent of one OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of common stock. Each series of Preferred Units makes a distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be convertible into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Company, subject to the terms of such Preferred Units. 
  Net income (loss) allocated to the preferred unitholders and common unitholders reflects their pro-rata share of net income (loss) and distributions. 
  Limited Partner Units 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , limited partners other than SL Green owned   4.29%  , or   4,495,410   common units, of the Operating Partnership. 
  Preferred Units 
  Preferred units not owned by SL Green are further described in Note 11,  Noncontrolling Interests on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements - Preferred Units of Limited Partnership Interest in the Operating Partnership.  
  Earnings per Unit

Subject to adjustments upon certain corporate transactions or events, awards with respect to up to a maximum of   27,030,000   fungible units may be granted under the 2005 Plan. Currently, different types of awards count against the limit on the number of fungible units differently, with (1) full-value awards (i.e., those that deliver the full value of the award upon vesting, such as restricted stock) granted after the effective date of the Fourth Amendment 2005 Plan counting as   3.74   Fungible Units per share subject to such awards, (2) stock options, stock appreciation rights and other awards that do not deliver full value and expire   five years   from the date of grant counting as   0.73   fungible units per share subject to such awards, and (3) all other awards (e.g.,   ten  -year stock options) counting as   1.0   fungible units per share subject to such awards. Awards granted under the 2005 Plan prior to the approval of the fourth amendment and restatement in June 2016 continue to count against the fungible unit limit based on the ratios that were in effect at the time such awards were granted, which may be different than the current ratios.  As a result, depending on the types of awards issued, the 2005 Plan may result in the issuance of more or less than   27,030,000   shares. If a stock option or other award granted under the 2005 Plan expires or terminates, the common stock subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. Shares of SL Green's common stock distributed under the 2005 Plan may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. Currently, unless the 2005 Plan has been previously terminated by the Company's board of directors, new awards may be granted under the 2005 Plan until June 2, 2026, which is the tenth anniversary of the date that the 2005 Plan was most recently approved by the Company's stockholders. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   10.3 million   fungible units were available for issuance under the 2005 Plan after reserving for shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units, phantom stock units granted pursuant to our Non-Employee Directors' Deferral Program and LTIP Units, including, among others, outstanding LTIP Units issued under our 2011 Long-Term Outperformance Plan. 
  Options are granted under the plan at the fair market value on the date of grant and, subject to employment, generally expire   five   or   ten years   from the date of grant, are not transferable other than on death, and generally vest in   one   to   five years   commencing   one year   from the date of grant. 
  The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on historical information with the following weighted average assumptions for grants during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended December 31,   2015  .

A summary of the status of the Company's stock options as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , and changes during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and year ended December 31,   2015   are as follows: 

All options were granted with strike prices ranging from   $20.67   to   $137.18  . The remaining weighted average contractual life of the options outstanding was   3.4   years and the remaining average contractual life of the options exercisable was   2.7   years. 
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized compensation expense for these options of   $2.5   million and   $6.4 million  , respectively.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized compensation expense for these options of   $1.9   million and   $5.8 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $9.8 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.4   years.    
  Stock-based Compensation 
  Effective January 1, 1999, the Company implemented a deferred compensation plan, or the Deferred Plan, where shares issued under the Deferred Plan were granted to certain employees, including our executives and vesting will occur annually upon the completion of a service period or our meeting established financial performance criteria. Annual vesting occurs at rates ranging from   15%   to   35%   once performance criteria are reached.    
  A summary of the Company's restricted stock as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015   and charges during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended December 31,   2015  , are as follows: 

The fair value of restricted stock that vested during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended December 31, 2015 was   $7.6 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   there was   $13.6 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.1 years  . 
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $1.5 million  ,   $4.4 million  , respectively, was capitalized to assets associated with compensation expense related to our long-term compensation plans, restricted stock and stock options.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $1.5 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively, was capitalized to assets associated with compensation expense related to our long-term compensation plans, restricted stock and stock options. 
  We have granted LTIP Units, which include bonus, time-based and performance based awards,   with a fa  ir value of   $28.1 million   and   $25.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The grant date fair value of the LTIP Unit awards was calculated in accordance with ASC 718. A third party consultant determined the fair value of the LTIP Units to

have a discount from SL Green's common stock price. The discount was calculated by considering the inherent uncertainty that the LTIP Units will reach parity with other common partnership units and the illiquidity due to transfer restrictions. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $6.0 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the time-based and performance based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.2 years   years. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded compensation expense related to bonus, time-based and performance based awards of   $2.3 million   and   $15.1 million  , respectively.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded compensation expense related to bonus, time-based and performance based awards of   $2.7 million   and   $19.0 million  , respectively. 
  2010 Notional Unit Long-Term Compensation Plan 
  In December 2009, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2010 Notional Unit Long-Term Compensation Program, or the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan. The 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan is a long-term incentive compensation plan pursuant to which award recipients could earn, in the aggregate, from   $15.0 million   up to   $75.0 million   of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on the Company's stock price appreciation over three years beginning on December 1, 2009; provided that, if maximum performance had been achieved,   $25.0 million   of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional   $25.0 million   of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. In order to achieve maximum performance under the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan, the Company's aggregate stock price appreciation during the performance period had to equal or exceed   50%  . The compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved at or shortly after the beginning of each of the second and third years of the performance period and for the full performance period and, accordingly,   385,583   LTIP Units,   327,416   LTIP Units and   327,416   LTIP Units were earned under the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan in December 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Substantially in accordance with the original terms of the program,   50%   of these LTIP Units vested on December 17, 2012 (accelerated from the original January 1, 2013 vesting date),   25%   of these LTIP Units vested on December 11, 2013 (accelerated from the original January 1, 2014 vesting date) and the remainder vested on January 1, 2015 based on continued employment. In accordance with the terms of the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan, distributions were not paid on any LTIP Units until they were earned, at which time we paid all distributions that would have been paid on the earned LTIP Units since the beginning of the performance period. 
  The cost of the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan (  $31.7 million  , subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period of January 1, 2015.  
  2011 Outperformance Plan 
  In August 2011, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2011 Outperformance Plan, or the 2011 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2011 Outperformance Plan could earn, in the aggregate, up to   $85.0 million   of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the three-year period beginning September 1, 2011. Under the 2011 Outperformance Plan, participants were entitled to share in a "performance pool" comprised of LTIP Units with a value equal to   10%   of the amount by which our total return to stockholders during the   three  -year period exceeded a cumulative total return to stockholders of   25%  , subject to the maximum of   $85.0 million   of LTIP Units; provided that if maximum performance was achieved, one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. LTIP Units earned under the 2011 Outperformance Plan were subject to vesting requirements, with   50%   of any awards earned vested on August 31, 2014 and the remaining   50%   vesting on August 31, 2015, based on continued employment with us through such dates. Participants were not entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2011 Outperformance Plan unless and until they were earned. For LTIP Units that were earned, each participant was also entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions are to be paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested. In June 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved during the third year of the performance period and, accordingly,   560,908   LTIP Units, representing two-thirds of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan. In September 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved for the full   three  -year performance period and, accordingly,   280,454   LTIP units, representing the final third of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan. 
  The cost of the 2011 Outperformance Plan (  $26.7 million  , subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded   no   compensation expense during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $0.6   million, and   $4.5 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to the 2011 Outperformance Plan.

In August 2014, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2014 Outperformance Plan, or the 2014 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2014 Outperformance Plan may earn, in the aggregate, up to   610,000   LTIP Units in our Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the   three  -year period beginning September 1, 2014. For each individual award, two-thirds of the LTIP Units may be earned based on the Company s absolute total return to stockholders and one-third of the LTIP Units may be earned based on relative total return to stockholders compared to the constituents of the MSCI REIT Index. Awards earned based on absolute total return to stockholders will be determined independently of awards earned based on relative total return to stockholders. In the event the Company s performance reaches either threshold before the end of the   three  -year performance period, a pro-rata portion of the maximum award may be earned. For each component, if the Company s performance reaches the maximum threshold beginning with the 19th month of the performance period, participants will earn one-third of the maximum award that may be earned for that component. If the Company s performance reaches the maximum threshold during the third year of the performance period for a component, participants will earn two-thirds (or an additional one-third) of the maximum award that may be earned for that component. LTIP Units earned under the 2014 Outperformance Plan will be subject to continued vesting requirements, with   50%   of any awards earned vesting on August 31, 2017 and the remaining   50%   vesting on August 31, 2018, subject to continued employment with us through such dates. Participants will not be entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2014 Outperformance Plan unless and until they are earned. If LTIP Units are earned, each participant will also be entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of cash or additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions will be paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested. 
  The cost of the 2014 Outperformance Plan (  $27.9 million  , subject to forfeitures), based on the portion of the 2014 Outperformance Plan granted as of   September 30, 2016  , will be amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded compensation expense of   $1.8 million   and   $6.6 million  , during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to the 2014 Outperformance Plan.  We recorded compensation expense of   $1.5 million  , and   $4.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to the 2014 Outperformance Plan. 
  Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors 
  Under our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program, which commenced July 2004, the Company's non-employee directors may elect to defer up to   100%   of their annual retainer fee, chairman fees, meeting fees and annual stock grant. Unless otherwise elected by a participant, fees deferred under the program shall be credited in the form of phantom stock units. The program provides that a director's phantom stock units generally will be settled in an equal number of shares of common stock upon the earlier of (i) the January 1 coincident with or the next following such director's termination of service from the Board of Directors or (ii) a change in control by us, as defined by the program. Phantom stock units are credited to each non-employee director quarterly using the closing price of SL Green's common stock on the first business day of the respective quarter. Each participating non-employee director is also credited with dividend equivalents or phantom stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter, which are either paid in cash currently or credited to the director s account as additional phantom stock units. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   8,136   phantom stock units were earned and   9,014   shares of common stock were issued to our board of directors. We recorded compensation expense of   $0.1 million  ,   $1.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. We recorded compensation expense of   $0.1 million  , and   $1.8 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   88,902   phantom stock units outstanding pursuant to our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program.  
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  In 2007, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, to encourage our employees to increase their efforts to make our business more successful by providing equity-based incentives to eligible employees. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, and has been adopted by the board to enable our eligible employees to purchase the Company's shares of common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on January 1, 2008 with a maximum of   500,000   shares of the common stock available for issuance, subject to adjustment upon a merger, reorganization, stock split or other similar corporate change. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the ESPP. The common stock is offered for purchase through a series of successive offering periods. Each offering period will be   three months   in duration and will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the first offering period having commenced on January 1, 2008. The ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase the common stock at a purchase price equal to   85%   of the lesser of (1) the market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (2) the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. The ESPP was approved

by our stockholders at our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   93,288   shares of SL Green's common stock had been issued under the ESPP.

  The following tables set forth the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is included in interest expense in the respective consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the deferred net losses from these terminated hedges, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to net unrealized loss on derivative instrument, was   $8.1 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively.  
              (2) 
    Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is included in equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the respective consolidated statements of operations. 
      
  16. Fair Value Measurements 
  We are required to disclose fair value information with regard to our financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, for which it is practical to estimate fair value. The FASB guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We measure and/or disclose the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on a hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions. This hierarchy consists of three broad levels: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are used when little or no market data is available. We follow this hierarchy for our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. In instances in which the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of the particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  
  The following tables set forth the assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis by their levels in the fair value hierarchy at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

We determine other than temporary impairment in real estate investments and debt and preferred equity investments, including intangibles, utilizing cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, which are classified as Level 3 inputs. 
  The marketable securities classified as Level 1 were derived from quoted prices in active markets. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the marketable securities classified as Level 2 were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using the significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Marketable securities in an unrealized loss position are not considered to be other than temporarily impaired. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. 
  The fair value of derivative instruments is based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well-recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions, which are classified as Level 2 inputs. 
  The financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, debt and preferred equity investments, mortgages and other loans payable and other secured and unsecured debt. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in our consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments. The fair value of debt and preferred equity investments, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The fair value of borrowings, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows of each debt to their present value using adjusted market interest rates, which is provided by a third-party specialist. 
  The following table provides the carrying value and fair value of these financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Amounts exclude net deferred financing costs. 
              (2) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , debt and preferred equity investments had an estimated fair value ranging between   $1.5 billion   and   $1.6 billion  . At December 31, 2015, debt and preferred equity investments had an estimated fair value ranging between   $1.7 billion   and   $1.8 billion  . 
     Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments was based on pertinent information available to us as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

17. Financial Instruments: Derivatives and Hedging 
  In the normal course of business, we use a variety of commonly used derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps, collar and floors, to manage, or hedge interest rate risk. We hedge our exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions in addition to anticipated future interest payments on existing debt. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheets at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedge asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Reported net income and equity may increase or decrease prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. Currently, all of our designated derivative instruments are effective hedging instruments. 
  The following table summarizes the notional value at inception and fair value of our consolidated derivative financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   based on Level 2 information. The notional value is an indication of the extent of our involvement in these instruments at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks (amounts in thousands). 

During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   $0.1 million   loss and   $0.5 million   gain, respectively on the changes in the fair value, which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. During both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded a gain on the changes in the fair value of   $0.1 million  , which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements was   $2.2 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements and was not in breach of any agreement provisions. If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their aggregate termination value of   $2.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Gains and losses on terminated hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are recognized into earnings over the term of the related mortgage obligation. Over time, the realized and unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. We estimate that   $4.9 million   of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into interest expense and   $1.7 million   of the portion related to our share of joint venture accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures within the next 12 months.

Selected consolidated results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and selected asset information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , regarding our operating segments are as follows (in thousands): 

Income from continuing operations represents total revenues less total expenses for the real estate segment and total investment income less allocated interest expense for the debt and preferred equity segment. Interest costs for the debt and preferred equity segment includes actual costs incurred for investments collateralizing the MRA. Interest is imputed on the remaining investments using our corporate borrowing cost. We also allocate loan loss reserves, net of recoveries, and transaction related costs to the debt and preferred equity segment.  
  We do not allocate marketing, general and administrative expenses to the debt and preferred equity segment since the use of personnel and resources is dependent on transaction volume between the two segments and varies period over period. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled   $25.5 million   and   $74.0 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled   $23.5 million   and   $72.1 million  , respectively. All other expenses, except interest, relate entirely to the real estate assets. 
  There were no transactions between the above two segments.

  The following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report of this Form 10-Q and in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned the following interests in commercial and residential properties in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which are collectively known as the Suburban properties: 

(1) 
    The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total occupied square feet divided by total acquisition square footage.  The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by total available units. 
              (2) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a building that was comprised of approximately   270,132   square feet (unaudited) of retail space and approximately   222,855   square feet (unaudited) of residential space. For the purpose of this report, we have included the building in the retail properties count and have bifurcated the square footage into the retail and residential components. 
      As of   September 30, 2016  , we also managed an approximately   336,000   square foot office building owned by a third party and held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of   $1.8 billion   including   $0.3 billion   of debt and preferred equity and other financing receivables that are included in other balance sheet line items.

Results of Operations 
   
  Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following comparison for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , or   2016  , to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , or   2015  , makes reference to the following: (i) the effect of the  Same-Store Properties,  which represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2015 and still owned by us in the same manner at   September 30, 2016   (Same-Store Properties totale  d     55   of our   69   consolidated operating properties), (ii) the effect of the  Acquisition Properties,  which represents all properties or interests in properties acquired in   2016   and   2015   and all non-Same-Store Properties, including properties that are under development, redevelopment or were deconsolidated during the period, and (iii)  Other,  which represents corporate level items not allocable to specific properties, including the Service Corporation and eEmerge Inc. Any assets sold or held for sale are excluded from income from continuing operations and from the following discussion. 

Rental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues 
  Rental revenues decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($31.3 million), the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($6.2 million), and accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) and decreased cash revenue ($2.0 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the tenant's bankruptcy.  These decreases were offset by the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($9.4 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($5.1 million), and the acquisition of 110 Greene Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($5.1 million).

     Table of Contents  

Escalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries ($3.2 million) at the Same-Store properties attributable to an increase in the related tax expense. 
  Occupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan combined office operating portfolio, including leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to   97.5%   at   September 30,   2016 as compared to   97.3%   at   September 30,   2015. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban combined office operating portfolio, including leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to   85.4%   at   September 30,   2016 as compared to   84.3%   at   September 30,   2015. 
  The following table presents a summary of the commenced leasing activity for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   in our Manhattan and Suburban portfolio:

              (4) 
    Average starting office rent excluding new tenants replacing vacancies was   $59.69   per rentable square feet for   337,519   rentable square feet. Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was   $73.22   per rentable square feet for   1,085,757   rentable square feet. 
              (5) 
    Average starting office rent excluding new tenants replacing vacancies was   $39.50   per rentable square feet for   31,974   rentable square feet. Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was   $35.40   per rentable square feet for   77,869   rentable square feet. 
     Investment Income 
         For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , investment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by lower weighted average yield and balance during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.4%, respectively, compared to $1.6 billion and 10.1%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the debt and preferred equity investments had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.6 years. 
  Other Income 
  Other income decreased primarily as a result of a tax benefit related to our taxable REIT subsidiary in 2015 ($4.0 million), a bankruptcy settlement received from a former tenant in 2015 ($2.7 million) and a decrease in year over year lease termination income ($2.4 million).

     Table of Contents  

Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($1.2 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($1.1 million) and increases in real estate taxes at our Same-Store properties ($3.2 million). The increase was partially offset by the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($1.6 million). 
  Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $25.4 million  , or   5.2%   of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and   53   basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to   $23.5 million  , or   4.8%   of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and   44   basis points of total assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2015. 
  Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income 
  Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($11.4 million), and the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($2.5 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding decreased to   $7.2 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $9.4 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The weighted average interest rate was   4.00%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   3.76%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the accelerated depreciation expense in 2015 at the site comprising the One Vanderbilt development project ($44.5 million) and the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($10.7 million). These decreases were offset by the acquisition of 110 Greene Street ($6.8 million), the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($5.2 million), and accounting write-offs ($4.4 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the tenant's bankruptcy.   
  Equity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  Equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased because of additional depreciation expense from the deconsolidation of 11 Madison Avenue ($8.0 million inclusive of $10.5 million of depreciation), partially offset by increased revenue from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 ($1.5 million). 
  Equity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures/Real Estate 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interest at 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of our joint venture interest at The Meadows ($1.6 million). 
  Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million) and an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million). 
  Depreciable Real Estate Reserves 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $19.2 million charge in connection with the expected sale of two of our properties.

Rental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues 
  Rental revenues increased primarily as a result of the properties acquired ($112.1 million), which included the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($80.0 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue ($15.2 million), and the acquisition of 110 Greene Street ($10.3 million) in the third quarter of 2015, while Same-Store Property revenues increased by ($10.6 million). In addition, rental revenues increased as a result of the accelerated recognition of non-cash deferred income from 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of the tenant exercising their option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($37.1 million). These increases were partially offset by the sales of 120 West 45th Street ($18.3 million) and 885 Third Avenue ($11.8 million), as well as accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) and decreased cash revenue ($2.0 million) related to space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the the tenant's bankruptcy. 
  Escalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries at the Same-Store Properties ($9.8 million) and Acquisition Properties ($10.6 million) attributable to an increase in the related tax expense.  This was partially offset by decreased real estate tax recoveries due to the sale of 120 West 45th Street ($4.9 million). 
  Occupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan combined office operating properties, including leases signed but not yet commenced increased to   97.5%   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   97.3%   at   September 30, 2015  . Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban combined office operating portfolio, including leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to   85.4%   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   84.3%   at   September 30, 2015  .

Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was   $37.48   per rentable square feet for   380,812   rentable square feet. 
     Investment Income 
  Investment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average yield and balance during the first nine months of 2016. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.8%, respectively, compared to $1.6 billion and 10.2%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the debt and preferred equity investments had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.6 years. 
  Other Income 
  Other income increased primarily as a result of the lease termination fee earned in connection with the termination of the lease with Citigroup, Inc. at 388-390 Greenwich Street ($94.0 million) and promote income earned in connection with the sale of 33 Beekman ($10.8 million), partially offset by a lease termination fee received at 919 Third Avenue in 2015 ($11.3 million).

Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($10.6 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue ($3.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015, and increases in real estate taxes at our Same-Store properties ($10.9 million). These increases were partially offset by the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($4.9 million). 
  Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $74.0 million  , or   4.4%   of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and   53   basis points of total assets including our share of joint venture assets compared to   $72.1 million  , or 5.1% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 68 basis points of total assets including our share of joint venture assets for the same period in 2015. 
  Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income 
  Interest expense, net of interest income, increased primarily as a result of 11 Madison Avenue ($27.4 million) which was acquired in the third quarter of 2015 and partially sold in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by the repayment of the mortgages in connection with the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($8.4 million) and of 120 West 45th Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($7.7 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding increased from   $8.7 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $9.1 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The weighted average interest rate decreased from 3.85% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to 3.79% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the accelerated depreciation expense related to 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of the tenant exercising their option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($329.7 million). The increase is also driven by the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($60.0 million). These increases were partially offset by the accelerated depreciation in 2015 related to vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($146.6 million). 
  Equity in Net Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  Equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased primarily as a result of higher net income contributions from 1552-1560 Broadway ($4.6 million) as a result of the settlement in February 2016 of arbitration regarding a tenant's rent at the property, and revenue from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 ($3.2 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease from 800 Third Avenue as a result of the $156.1 million upsize in the mortgage loan at the property in the first quarter of  2016 ($2.1 million). 
  Equity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interests at 33 Beekman ($33.0 million), 7 Renaissance Square ($4.2 million), 1 Jericho ($3.3 million) and EOP Denver ($2.8 million), compared to the gain for the same period in 2015 which was associated with the partial sale of 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million). 
  Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized gains on sale associated with the sale of the property at 388-390 Greenwich ($206.5 million) and 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York ($15.3 million), which were partially offset by the loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million). The gain during the same period in 2015 can be attributed to the sale of 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million) and 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million). 
  Depreciable Real Estate Reserves 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of 500 West Putnam ($10.4 million), as compared to the same period in 2015 when we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of two properties ($19.2 million). 
  Discontinued Operations 
  Discontinued operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   includes the gain recognized on the sale of 180 Maiden Lane ($17.0 million) and the related results of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which raised the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations to dispositions which represent a strategic shift in an entity s operations. The guidance was applied prospectively for new disposals. As a result, the results of operations for 388-390

Greenwich Street, which was classified as held for sale at March 31, 2016, 500 West Putnam Avenue, which was classified as held for sale at June 30, 2016 and 400 East 57th Street which was held for sale at September 30, 2016, are included in continuing operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Reconciliation of Same-Store Operating Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income 
  We present Same-Store net operating income, or Same-Store NOI, because we believe that this measure provides investors with useful information regarding the operating performance of properties that are comparable for the periods presented. We determine Same-Store NOI by subtracting Same-Store property operating expenses and ground rent from Same-Store rental revenues and other income. Our method of calculation may be different from methods used by other REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. None of these measures is an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and Same-Store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance. 
  For properties owned since January 1, 2015 and still owned and operated at   September 30, 2016  , Same-Store NOI is determined as follows (in millions): 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We currently expect that our principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital, acquisitions, development or redevelopment of properties, tenant improvements, leasing costs, repurchases or repayments of outstanding indebtedness (which may include exchangeable debt) and for debt and preferred equity investments will include: 
           (1) 
    Cash flow from operations; 
              (2) 
    Cash on hand; 
               (4) 
    Other forms of secured or unsecured financing; 
              (5) 
    Net proceeds from divestitures of properties and redemptions, participations and dispositions of debt and preferred equity investments; and 
              (6) 
    Proceeds from common or preferred equity or debt offerings by the Company, the Operating Partnership (including issuances of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and Trust preferred securities) or ROP. 
     Cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs. Additionally, we believe that our debt and preferred equity investment program will continue to serve as a source of operating cash flow.

The combined aggregate principal maturities of our property mortgages and other loans payable, corporate obligations and our share of joint venture debt, including as-of-right extension options, as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $466.2 million   of consolidated cash on hand, inclusive of   $60.4 million   of marketable securities. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. We may seek to divest of properties or interests in properties or access private and public debt and equity capital when the opportunity presents itself, although there is no guarantee that this capital will be made available to us at efficient levels or at all. Management believes that these sources of liquidity, if we are able to access them, along with potential refinancing opportunities for secured debt, will allow us to satisfy our debt obligations, as described above, upon maturity, if not before. 
  We also have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners who we consider to be financially stable and who have the ability to fund a capital call when needed. Most of our joint ventures are financed with non-recourse debt. We believe that property level cash flows along with unfunded committed indebtedness and proceeds from the refinancing of outstanding secured indebtedness will be sufficient to fund the capital needs of our joint venture properties. 
   
  Cash Flows 
  The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on our consolidated statements of cash flows in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.  
  Cash and cash equivalents were    $405.9 million   and   $244.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, representing a increase of   $161.5 million  . The increase was a result of the following changes in cash flows (in thousands): 

Our principal source of operating cash flow is related to the leasing and operating of the properties in our portfolio. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution requirements. Our debt and preferred equity and joint venture investments also provide a steady stream of operating cash flow to us.

Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we used cash primarily for the following investing activities (in thousands): 

Funds spent on capital expenditures, which comprise building and tenant improvements, increased from   $219.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $269.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , relating primarily to increased costs incurred in connection with the redevelopment of properties. 
  We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, property-level financing, our 2012 credit facility, our MRA facility, senior unsecured notes, convertible or exchangeable securities, construction loans and from time to time, Company issued common or preferred stock, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest.

The Company did not make any sales of its common stock under an ATM program in the first nine months of 2016. 
  Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
  In February 2015, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC for our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or DRSPP, which automatically became effective upon filing. The Company registered   3,500,000   shares of SL Green's common stock under the DRSPP. The DRSPP commenced on September 24, 2001. 
  The following table summarizes SL Green common stock issued, and proceeds received from dividend reinvestments and/or stock purchases under the DRSPP for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively (dollars in thousands): 

Fourth Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option and Incentive Plan 
  The Fourth Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or the 2005 Plan, was approved by the Company's board of directors in April 2016 and its stockholders in June 2016 at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders. Subject to adjustments upon certain corporate transactions or events, awards with respect to up to a maximum of   27,030,000   fungible units may be granted as options, restricted stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards under the 2005 Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   10.3 million   fungible units were available for issuance under the 2005 Plan after reserving for shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units, phantom stock units granted pursuant to our Non-Employee Directors' Deferral Program and LTIP Units, including, among others, outstanding LTIP Units issued under our 2011 Long-Term Outperformance Plan. 
  2010 Notional Unit Long-Term Compensation Plan 
  In December 2009, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2010 Notional Unit Long-Term Compensation Program, or the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan. The 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan is a long-term incentive compensation plan pursuant to which award recipients could earn, in the aggregate, from   $15.0 million   up to   $75.0 million   of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on the Company's stock price appreciation over three years beginning on December 1, 2009; provided that, if maximum performance had been achieved,   $25.0 million   of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional   $25.0 million   of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. In order to achieve maximum performance under the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan, the Company's aggregate stock price appreciation during the performance period had to equal or exceed   50%  . The compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved at or shortly after the beginning of each of the second and third years of the performance period and for the full performance period and, accordingly,   385,583   LTIP Units,   327,416   LTIP Units and   327,416   LTIP Units were earned under the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan in December 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Substantially in accordance with the original terms of the program,   50%   of these LTIP Units vested on December 17, 2012 (accelerated from the original January 1, 2013 vesting date),   25%   of these LTIP Units vested on December 11, 2013 (accelerated from the original January 1, 2014 vesting date) and the remainder vested on January 1, 2015 based on continued employment. In accordance with the terms of the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan, distributions were not paid on any LTIP Units until they were earned, at which time we paid all distributions that would have been paid on the earned LTIP Units since the beginning of the performance period. 
  The cost of the 2010 Long-Term Compensation Plan (  $31.7 million  , subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period of January 1, 2015.

2011 Outperformance Plan 
  In August 2011, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2011 Outperformance Plan, or the 2011 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2011 Outperformance Plan could earn, in the aggregate, up to   $85.0 million   of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the three-year period beginning September 1, 2011. Under the 2011 Outperformance Plan, participants were entitled to share in a "performance pool" comprised of LTIP Units with a value equal to   10%   of the amount by which our total return to stockholders during the   three  -year period exceeded a cumulative total return to stockholders of   25%  , subject to the maximum of   $85.0 million   of LTIP Units; provided that if maximum performance was achieved, one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. LTIP Units earned under the 2011 Outperformance Plan are subject to continued vesting requirements, with   50%   of any awards earned vested on August 31, 2014 and the remaining   50%   vesting on August 31, 2015, subject to continued employment with us through such dates. Participants were not entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2011 Outperformance Plan unless and until they were earned. For LTIP Units that were earned, each participant was also entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions are to be paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested. In June 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved during the third year of the performance period and, accordingly,   560,908   LTIP Units, representing two-thirds of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan. In September 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved for the full   three  -year performance period and, accordingly,   280,454   LTIP units, representing the final third of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan. 
  The cost of the 2011 Outperformance Plan (  $26.7 million  , subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded   no compensation expens  e during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,  and   $0.6 million   and $  4.5 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to the 2011 Outperformance Plan.   
  2014 Outperformance Plan 
  In August 2014, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2014 Outperformance Plan, or the 2014 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2014 Outperformance Plan may earn, in the aggregate, up to   610,000   LTIP Units in our Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the   three  -year period beginning September 1, 2014. For each individual award, two-thirds of the LTIP Units may be earned based on the Company s absolute total return to stockholders and one-third of the LTIP Units may be earned based on relative total return to stockholders compared to the constituents of the MSCI REIT Index. Awards earned based on absolute total return to stockholders will be determined independently of awards earned based on relative total return to stockholders. In the event the Company s performance reaches either threshold before the end of the   three  -year performance period, a pro-rata portion of the maximum award may be earned. For each component, if the Company s performance reaches the maximum threshold beginning with the 19th month of the performance period, participants will earn one-third of the maximum award that may be earned for that component. If the Company s performance reaches the maximum threshold during the third year of the performance period for a component, participants will earn two-thirds (or an additional one-third) of the maximum award that may be earned for that component. LTIP Units earned under the 2014 Outperformance Plan will be subject to continued vesting requirements, with   50%   of any awards earned vesting on August 31, 2017 and the remaining   50%   vesting on August 31, 2018, subject to continued employment with us through such dates. Participants will not be entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2014 Outperformance Plan unless and until they are earned. If LTIP Units are earned, each participant will also be entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of cash or additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions will be paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested. 
  The cost of the 2014 Outperformance Plan (  $27.9 million  , subject to forfeitures), based on the portion of the 2014 Outperformance Plan granted as of   September 30, 2016  , will be amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded compensation expense of   $1.8 million   and   $6.6 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to the 2014 Outperformance Plan.  We recorded compensation expense of   $1.5 million   and   $4.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to the 2014 Outperformance Plan. 
  Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors 
  Under our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program, which commenced July 2004, the Company's non-employee directors may elect to defer up to   100%   of their annual retainer fee, chairman fees, meeting fees and annual stock grant. Unless otherwise elected by a participant, fees deferred under the program shall be credited in the form of phantom stock units. The program provides that a director's phantom stock units generally will be settled in an equal number of shares of common stock upon the earlier of

     Table of Contents  

(i) the January 1 coincident with or the next following such director's termination of service from the Board of Directors or (ii) a change in control by us, as defined by the program. Phantom stock units are credited to each non-employee director quarterly using the closing price of SL Green's common stock on the first business day of the respective quarter. Each participating non-employee director is also credited with dividend equivalents or phantom stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter, which are either paid in cash currently or credited to the director s account as additional phantom stock units. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   8,136   phantom stock units were earned and 9,014 shares of common stock were issued to our board of directors. We recorded compensation expense of  $0.2 million and $1.9 million during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to the Deferred Compensation Plan.  We recorded compensation expense of  $0.1 million and $1.8 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were 88,902 phantom stock units outstanding pursuant to our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program. 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  In 2007, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, to encourage our employees to increase their efforts to make our business more successful by providing equity-based incentives to eligible employees. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, and has been adopted by the board to enable our eligible employees to purchase the Company's shares of common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on January 1, 2008 with a maximum of   500,000   shares of the common stock available for issuance, subject to adjustment upon a merger, reorganization, stock split or other similar corporate change. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the ESPP. The common stock is offered for purchase through a series of successive offering periods. Each offering period will be   three months   in duration and will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the first offering period having commenced on January 1, 2008. The ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase the common stock at a purchase price equal to   85%   of the lesser of (1) the market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (2) the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. The ESPP was approved by our stockholders at our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   93,288   shares of SL Green's common stock had been issued under the ESPP. 
  Market Capitalization 
  At   September 30, 2016  , borrowings under our mortgages and other loans payable, 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes, trust preferred securities and our share of joint venture debt represented   43%   of our combined market capitalization of   $20.8 billion   (based on a common stock price of   $108.1   per share, the closing price of SL Green's common stock on the NYSE on   September 30, 2016  ). Market capitalization includes our consolidated debt, common and preferred stock and the conversion of all units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, and our share of joint venture debt.

Indebtedness 
  The table below summarizes our consolidated mortgages and other loans payable, 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes and trust preferred securities outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , (amounts in thousands). 

The variable rate debt shown above generally bears interest at an interest rate based on 30-day LIBOR (  0.53%   and   0.43%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively). Our consolidated debt at   September 30, 2016   had a weighted average term to maturity of   4.40   years. 
  Certain of our debt and equity investments and other investments, with a carrying value of   $1.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , are variable rate investments which mitigate our exposure to interest rate changes on our unhedged variable rate debt. 
  Mortgage Financing 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total mortgage debt (excluding our share of joint venture mortgage debt of   $2.7 billion  ) consisted of   $3.6 billion   of fixed rate debt, including swapped variable rate debt, with an effective weighted average interest rate of   4.66%   and   $0.5 billion   of variable rate debt with an effective weighted average interest rate of   2.49%  .

  2012 Credit Facility 
  In August 2016, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility that was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, referred to as the 2012 credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility, as amended, consisted of a   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility and a   $1.2 billion   term loan, with a maturity date of March 29, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The revolving credit facility has an as-of-right extension to March 29, 2020. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity under the revolving credit facility to   $3.0 billion   at any time prior to the maturity date for the revolving credit facility without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility bore interest at a spread over LIBOR ranging from (i)   87.5   basis points to   155   basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility and (ii)   95   basis points to   190   basis points for loans under the term loan facility, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the applicable spread was   125   basis points for revolving credit facility and   140   basis points for the term loan facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the effective interest rate was   1.73%   for the revolving credit facility and   2.25%   for the term loan facility. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a   12.5   to   30   basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. As of   September 30, 2016  , the facility fee was   25   basis points. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $56.5 million   of outstanding letters of credit,   zero   drawn under the revolving credit facility and   $1.2 billion   outstanding under the term loan facility, with total undrawn capacity of   $1.5 billion   under the 2012 credit facility.

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of   $(6.9) million  , representing deferred financing costs presented within other liabilities, and   $985.1 million  , respectively, net of deferred financing costs. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the term loan facility had a carrying value of   $1.2 billion   and   $929.5 million  , respectively, net of deferred financing costs. 
  The Company, the Operating Partnership and ROP are all borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2012 credit facility. None of our other subsidiaries are obligors under the 2012 credit facility. 
  The 2012 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below). 
  Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Facility 
  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, a New York licensed captive insurance company, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. As a member, Belmont may borrow funds from the FHLBNY in the form of secured advances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $229.0 million   in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of   0.90%  .  
  On January 12, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, adopted a final regulation on Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, membership.  The rule excludes captive insurance entities from FHLB membership on a going-forward basis and provides termination rules for current captive insurance members.  Unless the final rule is modified, Belmont's membership will terminate on February 19, 2017, at which point we would be required to repay all funds borrowed from the FHLBNY. 
  Master Repurchase Agreement 
  The Master Repurchase Agreement, as amended in December 2013, or MRA, provides us with the ability to sell certain debt investments with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same at a certain date or on demand. This MRA has a maximum facility capacity of   $300.0   million and bears interest ranging from   225   and   400   basis points over 30-day LIBOR depending on the pledged collateral. Since December 6, 2015 we have been required to pay monthly in arrears a   25   basis point fee on the excess of   $150.0 million   over the average daily balance during the period if the average daily balance is less than   $150.0 million  . We seek to mitigate risks associated with our repurchase agreement by managing the credit quality of our assets, early repayments, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and market value. The margin call provisions under our repurchase facility permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity, and are not limited to collateral-specific credit marks. To monitor credit risk associated with our debt investments, our asset management team regularly reviews our investment portfolio and is in contact with our borrowers in order to monitor the collateral and enforce our rights as necessary. The risk associated with potential margin calls is further mitigated by our ability to recollateralize the facility with additional assets from our portfolio of debt investments, our ability to satisfy margin calls with cash or cash equivalents and our access to additional liquidity through the 2012 credit facility, as defined below.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the gross book value of the properties and debt and preferred equity investments collateralizing the mortgages and other loans payable, not including assets held for sale, was approximately   $6.4 billion   and   $10.8 billion  , respectively.

Senior Unsecured Notes 
  The following table sets forth our senior unsecured notes and other related disclosures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, by scheduled maturity date (dollars in thousands): 

(1) 
    Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually with principal and unpaid interest due on the scheduled maturity dates. 
              (2) 
    Issued by the Operating Partnership. Interest on these exchangeable notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. The notes had an initial exchange rate representing an exchange price that was set at a   30.0%   premium to the last reported sale price of SL Green's common stock on October 6, 2010, or   $85.81  . The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The current exchange rate is   12.5697   shares of SL Green's common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of these notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are exchangeable upon the occurrence of specified events and during the period beginning on the twenty-second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date and ending on the second business day prior to the maturity date, into cash or a combination of cash and shares of SL Green's common stock, if any, at our option. As a result of meeting specified events (as defined in the Indenture Agreement), these notes became exchangeable commencing January 1, 2016 and will remain exchangeable through   September 30, 2016  . The notes are guaranteed by ROP. On the issuance date,   $78.3 million   of the debt balance was recorded in equity. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $14.2 million   remained to be amortized into the debt balance. 
              (3) 
    Issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership and ROP, as co-obligors. 
       Restrictive Covenants 
  The terms of the 2012 credit facility, as amended, and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that, we will not during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests, except to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
  Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures 
  In June 2005, the Company and the Operating Partnership issued   $100.0 million   in unsecured trust preferred securities through a newly formed trust, SL Green Capital Trust I, or the Trust, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The securities mature in 2035 and bear interest at a fixed rate of   5.61%   for the first   ten years   ending July 2015. Thereafter, the interest rate will float at   125   basis points over the three-month LIBOR. Interest payments may be deferred for a period of up to eight consecutive quarters if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to defer such payments. The Trust preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole or in part, with no prepayment premium. We do not consolidate the Trust even though it is a variable interest entity as we are not the primary beneficiary. Because the Trust is not consolidated, we have recorded the debt on our consolidated balance sheets and the related payments are classified as interest expense. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate debt. Our exposure to interest rate changes are managed through the use of interest rate derivatives instruments and/or through our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for   2016   would decrease

our annual interest cost, net of interest income from variable rate debt, by   $2.8 million   and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by   $11.5 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , $1.2 billion of our $1.8 billion debt and preferred equity portfolio is indexed to LIBOR. 
  We recognize most derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is considered a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. 
  Our long-term debt of   $5.5 billion   bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. Our variable rate debt and variable rate joint venture debt as of   September 30, 2016   bore interest based on a spread of LIBOR plus   28   basis points to LIBOR plus   417   basis points. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Refer to our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our contractual obligations. There have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, to these contractual obligations during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have off-balance sheet investments, including joint ventures and debt and preferred equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. Substantially all of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrangements. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments" and Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Capital Expenditures 
  We estimate that for the year ending December 31, 2016,  we expect to incur   $71.6 million   of recurring capital expenditures and   $57.5 million   of development or redevelopment expenditures, net of loan reserves, (including tenant improvements and leasing commissions) on existing consolidated properties, and our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties, net of loan reserves, will be   $16.5 million  . Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with operating cash flow, existing liquidity, or incremental borrowings. We expect our capital needs over the next twelve months and thereafter will be met through a combination of cash on hand, net cash provided by operations, potential asset sales, borrowings or additional equity or debt issuances. 
   
  Dividends/Distributions 
  We expect to pay dividends to our stockholders based on the distributions we receive from our Operating Partnership primarily from property revenues net of operating expenses or, if necessary, from working capital. 
  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined before taking into consideration the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Based on our current annual dividend rate of   $2.88   per share, we would pay   $288.7 million   in dividends to SL Green's common stockholders on an annual basis. Before we pay any dividend, whether for Federal income tax purposes or otherwise, which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under the 2012 credit facility and senior unsecured notes, we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our mortgages and loans payable. 
   
  Related Party Transactions 
  Cleaning/ Security/ Messenger and Restoration Services 
  Through Alliance Building Services, or Alliance, First Quality Maintenance, L.P., or First Quality, provides cleaning, extermination and related services, Classic Security LLC provides security services, Bright Star Couriers LLC provides messenger services, and Onyx Restoration Works provides restoration services with respect to certain properties owned by us. Alliance is partially owned by Gary Green, a son of Stephen L. Green, the chairman of SL Green's board of directors. In addition, First Quality has the non-exclusive opportunity to provide cleaning and related services to individual tenants at our properties on a basis separately negotiated with any tenant seeking such additional services. The Service Corporation has entered into an arrangement with Alliance whereby it will receive a profit participation above a certain threshold for services provided by Alliance to certain tenants at certain buildings above the base services specified in their lease agreements.

Income earned from profit participation, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations, was    $0.8 million   and   $2.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and was   $0.9 million   and   $2.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  We also recorded expenses for these services, inclusive of capitalized expenses, of   $5.3 million   and   $16.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively (excluding services provided directly to tenants), and   $5.7 million   and   $14.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Management Fees 
  S.L. Green Management Corp., a consolidated entity, receives property management fees from an entity in which Stephen L. Green owns an interest. We received management fees from this entity of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We received management fees from this entity of $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  Insurance 
  We maintain  all-risk  property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism) within three property insurance portfolios and liability insurance. The first property portfolio maintains a blanket limit of $950.0 million per occurrence, including terrorism, for the majority of the New York City properties in our portfolio and expires December 31, 2016. The second portfolio maintains a limit of $1.5 billion per occurrence, including terrorism, for several New York City properties and the majority of the Suburban properties and expires December 31, 2016. Each of these policies includes $100.0 million of flood coverage, with a lower sublimit for locations in high hazard flood zones. A third blanket property policy covers most of our residential assets and maintains a limit of $386.0 million per occurrence, including terrorism, for our residential properties and expires January 31, 2018. We maintain two liability policies which cover all our properties and provide limits of $201.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate per location. The liability policies expire on October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2017 and cover our commercial and residential assets, respectively. Additional coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets. 
  In October 2006, we formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, to act as a captive insurance company and as one of the elements of our overall insurance program. Belmont is a subsidiary of ours. Belmont was formed in an effort to, among other reasons, stabilize to some extent the fluctuations of insurance market conditions. Belmont is licensed in New York to write Terrorism, NBCR (nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological), General Liability, Environmental Liability and D O coverage.  
  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, which was enacted in November 2002, was renewed December 31, 2005 and again on December 31, 2007. Congress extended TRIA, now called TRIPRA (Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2007) until December 31, 2014.  TRIPRA was not renewed by Congress and expired on December 31, 2014.  However, on January 12, 2015, TRIPRA was reauthorized until December 31, 2020 (Terrorism Insurance Program Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2015).The law extends the federal Terrorism Insurance Program that requires insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage and provides for compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of certified terrorism, subject to the current program trigger of $100.0 million, which will increase by $20 million per annum, commencing December 31, 2015.  Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), mezzanine loans, ground leases, our 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes and other corporate obligations, contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we currently maintain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these obligations, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. In such instances, there can be no assurance that the lenders or ground lessors under these instruments will not take the position that a total or partial exclusion from  all-risk  insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt and ground lease instruments allowing the lenders or ground lessors to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt or recapture of ground lease positions. In addition, if lenders prevail in asserting that we are required to maintain full coverage for these risks, it could result in substantially higher insurance premiums. 
  We own Belmont and the accounts of Belmont are part of our consolidated financial statements. If Belmont experiences a loss and is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of Belmont s required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by Belmont should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. 
  We monitor all properties that are subject to triple net leases to ensure that tenants are providing adequate coverage.  Certain joint ventures may be covered under policies separate from our policies, at coverage limits which we deem to be adequate.  We continually monitor these policies.  Although we consider our insurance coverage to be appropriate, in the event of a major catastrophe, we may not have sufficient coverage to replace certain properties.

Funds from Operations 
  Funds from Operations, or FFO, is a widely recognized measure of REIT performance. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and as subsequently amended, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. 
  We also use FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based bonuses for members of our senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. 
  FFO for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

Inflation 
  Substantially all of our office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations as well as operating expense recoveries based on increases in the Consumer Price Index or other measures such as porters' wage. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases will be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  SL GREEN REALTY CORP. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As the Company does not control these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those the Company maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to the Company that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   the Operating Partnership issued no units of limited partnership interest in connection with an     acquisition. SL Green may satisfy redemption requests for the units issued in the transaction described above with shares of SL Green s common stock, on a one-for- one basis, pursuant to the Operating Partnership agreement.

All capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Partnership Agreement. 
    
  WHEREAS, the Partnership desires to amend the Partnership Agreement, pursuant to Sections 4.02.A, 5.04, 6.02 and 14.01.B of the Partnership Agreement, to, among other things,      provide for equity incentives to certain persons who provide services for the benefit of the Partnership in the form of a new class of Units designated as  Class O LTIP Units  (as defined below); 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, 
    
  1.             The General Partner hereby amends the Agreements as follows: 
    
  A.            Article 1 of the Partnership Agreement is amended by inserting the following definitions in alphabetical order: 
    
     Class O LTIP Unit Sharing Percentage    means, for a Class O LTIP Unit, the percentage that is specified as the Class O LTIP Unit Sharing Percentage in the Vesting Agreement or other documentation pursuant to which such Class O LTIP Unit is issued or, if no such percentage is specified, 10%. 
    
     Class O LTIP Unit    has the meaning set forth in Section 4.2.C. 
    
  B.    Section 4.2.C of the Partnership Agreement is amended by replacing the text thereof with the following: 
    
     Classes of Partnership Units  . From and after the Effective Date, subject to Section 4.2.A above, the Partnership shall have two classes of Partnership Units, entitled  Class A Units  and  Class B Units.   From and after March 15, 2006, the Partnership shall have an additional class of Partnership Units, entitled  LTIP Units.   From and after June 17, 2016, the Partnership shall have an additional class of Partnership Units, entitled  Class O LTIP Units.  Either Class A Units or Class B Units, at the election of the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may be issued to newly admitted Partners in exchange for the contribution by such Partners of cash, real estate partnership interests, stock, notes or other assets or consideration, provided that, any Partnership Unit that is not specifically designated by the General Partner as being of a particular class shall be deemed to be a Class A Unit.  
    
  C.            Section 4.2.D of the Partnership Agreement is amended by replacing the text thereof with the following: 
    
     Issuance of LTIP Units and Class O LTIP Units  . From time to time the General Partner may issue LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units to Persons providing services to or for the benefit of the Partnership. LTIP Units shall have the rights, powers, privileges, restrictions, qualifications and limitations specified in Exhibit F-1 hereto. Class O LTIP Units shall have the rights, powers, privileges, restrictions, qualifications and limitations specified in Exhibit F-2 hereto. LTIP Units and Class O LTIP Units are intended to qualify as profits interests in the Partnership and for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section 4.4 shall not apply to the issuance of LTIP Units or Class O LTIP Units.  
    
  D.    Section 5.1.F of the Partnership Agreement is amended by replacing the text thereof with the following: 
    
     LTIP Units and Class O LTIP Units Intended to Qualify as Profits Interests  . Distributions made pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be adjusted as necessary to ensure that the amount apportioned to each LTIP Unit or Class O LTIP Unit does not exceed the amount attributable to items of Partnership income or gain realized after the date such LTIP Unit or Class O LTIP Unit, as applicable, was issued by the Partnership. The intent of this Section 5.1.F is to  

ensure that any LTIP Units and Class O LTIP Units issued after the date of this Agreement qualify as  profits interests  under Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191 (August 3, 2001), and Section 5.1 shall be interpreted and applied consistently therewith. The General Partner at its discretion may amend this Section 5.1.F to ensure that any LTIP Units or Class O LTIP Units granted after the date of this Agreement will qualify as  profits interests  under Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191 (August 3, 2001) (and any other similar rulings or regulations that may be in effect at such time).  
    
  E.    Section 6.1.E of the Partnership Agreement is amended and restated as follows: 
    
     Special Allocations With Respect to LTIP Units  . After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit C hereto, and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6.1.A and 6.1.B above, but subject to the prior allocation of income and gain under clauses 6.1.A(i) through (v) above, any Liquidating Gains shall first be allocated to the holders of LTIP Units and Class O LTIP Units until the Economic Capital Account Balances of such holders, to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units and Class O LTIP Units, are equal to (A) (i) the Class A Unit Economic Balance, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (1) the number of their LTIP Units and (2) the number of Class A Units into which their Class O LTIP Units would then be convertible, assuming for such purpose that such Class O LTIP Units were Vested Class O LTIP Units plus (B) with respect to Special LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units, the aggregate net amount of Net Income and Net Loss allocated to such Special LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units prior to the Distribution Participation Date with respect to such Special LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units less the amount of any Special LTIP Unit Distributions and/or Class O LTIP Distributions with respect to such Special LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units; provided that no such     Liquidating Gains will be allocated with respect to any particular LTIP Unit and/or Class O LTIP Unit unless and to the extent that such Liquidating Gains, when aggregated with other Liquidating Gains realized since the issuance of such LTIP Unit and/or Class O LTIP Unit, exceed Liquidating Losses realized since the issuance of such LTIP Unit and/or Class O LTIP Unit. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit C hereto, and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6.1.A and 6.1.B above, in the event that, due to distributions with respect to Class A Units in which the LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units do not participate, a revaluation of assets pursuant to Exhibit B, or otherwise, the Economic Capital Account Balance of any present or former holder of LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units, to the extent attributable to the holder s ownership of LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units, exceeds the target balance specified above, then Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to such holder to the extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the disparity. In the event that Liquidating Gains or Liquidating Losses are allocated under this Section 6.1.E or Section 6.1.F, Net Income allocable under clause 6.1.A(vi) and any Net Losses shall be recomputed without regard to the Liquidating Gains or Liquidating Losses so allocated. For this purpose,    Liquidating Gains    means any net capital gain realized in connection with the actual or hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, including but not limited to net capital gain realized in connection with an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership assets under Section 1.D of Exhibit B to this Agreement. Similarly,    Liquidating Losses    means any net capital loss realized in connection with any such event. The    Economic Capital Account Balances    of the holders of LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units will be equal to their Capital Account balances, plus the amount of their shares of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units. Similarly, the    Class A Unit Economic Balance    shall mean (i) the Capital Account balance of the General Partner, plus the amount of the General Partner s share of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to the General Partner s ownership of Class A Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations through the date on which any allocation is made under this Section 6.1.E, divided by (ii) the number of the General Partner s Class A Units. Any such allocations shall first be made among the holders of LTIP Units in proportion to the amounts required to be allocated to each under this Section 6.1.E and next to the holders of Class O LTIP Units in proportion to the amounts required to be allocated to each under this Section 6.1.E. The parties agree that the intent of this Section 6.1.E and Section 6.1.F is to make the Capital Account balance associated with (x) each LTIP Unit economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance associated with one of the General Partner s Class A Units and (y) each Class O LTIP Unit economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance associated with a number of Class A Units of the General Partner equal to the number of Class A Units (or fractions thereof), if any, into which such Class O LTIP Unit would then be convertible, assuming for such purpose that such Class O LTIP Unit was a Vested Class O LTIP Unit (in each case, on a per-unit basis and, with respect to Special LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units, other than differences resulting from the allocation of Net Income and Net Loss to Special LTIP Units and/or Class O LTIP Units prior to the Distribution Participation Date with respect to such Units pursuant to Section 3 of Exhibit F-1 or Exhibit F-2, as applicable, in excess of the amount of Special LTIP Unit Distributions or Class O LTIP Units paid with respect  

thereto), but only if the Partnership has recognized cumulative net gains with respect to its assets since the issuance of the relevant LTIP Unit and/or Class O LTIP Units.  
    
  C.            Section 6.1 of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended by appending the following to the end of such Section as a new Section 6.1.F: 
    
     Special Allocation upon Conversion of Class O LTIP Unit  . After a holder s conversion of a Class O LTIP Unit into a fraction of a Class A Unit and after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit C and in Section 6.1.E, and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6.1.A and 6.1.B above, but subject to the prior allocation of income and gain under clauses 6.1.A(i) through (v) above, the Partnership will specially allocate Liquidating Gain and Liquidating Loss to the Partners until and in a manner that causes, as promptly as practicable, the portion of the Economic Capital Account Balance of the Partner converting the Class O LTIP Unit that is attributable to the fraction of a Class A Unit received upon the conversion to equal the Class A Unit Economic Balance multiplied by a fraction equal to the fraction of the Class A Unit issued in the conversion.  
    
  D.    Section 8.6.A of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the phrases  LTIP Unit  and  LTIP Units  with the phrases  LTIP Unit or Class O LTIP Unit  and  LTIP Units or Class O LTIP Units,  respectively. 
    
  E.    Exhibit F to the Partnership Agreement is hereby redesignated as  Exhibit F-1.  All references to  Exhibit F  in the Partnership Agreement or Exhibit F-1 shall be replaced with references to  Exhibit F-1.  
    
  F.    The Partnership Agreement is hereby amended by appending Exhibit F-2 to this Amendment as Exhibit F-2 to the Partnership Agreement.  

2.             Except as modified herein, all terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
    
  3.             This Amendment shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law.

    Right to Convert Class O LTIP Units into Class A Units  . 
       
           A. 
    Conversion Right  . A holder of Class O LTIP Units shall have the right (the    Class O Conversion Right   ), at his or her option, at any time to convert all or a portion of his or her Vested Class O LTIP Units into Class A Units. In order to exercise his or her Class O Conversion Right, a holder of Class O LTIP Units shall deliver a notice (a    Class O Conversion Notice   ) in the form attached as Attachment A to this Exhibit F-2 to the Partnership. Holders of Class O LTIP Units shall not have the right to convert Unvested Class O LTIP Units into Class A Units until they become Vested Class O LTIP Units;   provided  ,   however  , that when a holder of Class O LTIP Units is notified of the expected occurrence of an event that will cause his or her Unvested Class O LTIP Units to become Vested Class O LTIP Units (or at such other times as is permitted by the General Partner), such Person may give the Partnership a Class O Conversion Notice conditioned upon and  

effective as of the time of vesting (or the occurrence of such other event as may be permitted by the General Partner), and such Class O Conversion Notice shall become effective upon the time of such vesting (or such other event) unless it is revoked by the holder of the Class O LTIP Units prior to such time. In all cases, the conversion of any Class O LTIP Units into Class A Units shall be subject to the conditions and procedures set forth in this Section 7.   
           B. 
    Mandatory Conversion  . On the Mandatory Conversion Date, Vested Class O LTIP Units that have not previously been converted shall be converted into Class A Units without any further action. The    Mandatory Conversion Date    shall mean, for each Class O LTIP Unit, the date specified as such in the relevant Vesting Agreement or, if no such date is specified, the date that is 10 years after the issuance of such Class O LTIP Unit. 
              C. 
    Forced Conversion in Connection with a Sale Event  . Upon the effective time of a Sale Event (as defined below), at the election of the General Partner, either (i) all then outstanding Class O LTIP Units shall vest and be converted into Class A Units (a    Forced Conversion   ) or (ii) the Class O LTIP Units will remain outstanding and continue with appropriate adjustment pursuant to Section 4 above (and any other similar adjustment provisions applicable to the Class O LTIP Units). A    Sale Event    shall mean (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the General Partner Entity on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity, (ii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted into or exchanged for securities of the successor entity and the voting securities of the General Partner Entity outstanding immediately prior to such merger, reorganization or consolidation would (A) represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) less than 50% of the total voting power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger, reorganization or consolidation or (B) cease to have the power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such surviving entity, or (iii) the sale of all of the Common Stock of the General Partner Entity to an unrelated person or entity. 
     In the event of a Forced Conversion, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of Class O LTIP Units to be afforded the right to receive, in connection with the Sale Event in consideration for the Class A Units into which his or her Class O LTIP Units will be converted, the same kind and amount of cash, securities and other property (or any combination thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such Sale Event by a holder of the same number of Class A Units, assuming such holder of Class A Units is not a Constituent Person or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. Regardless of whether the General Partner elects to cause a Forced Conversion, in the event the Partnership is a party to a transaction pursuant to which Class A Units shall be exchanged for or converted into the right to receive cash, securities or other property, then, prior to the completion of such transaction, the General Partner shall give written notice to each holder of Class O LTIP Units, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford such holders the right to elect the form or type of consideration to be received with respect to each Class A Unit issuable upon conversion of each Class O LTIP Unit held by such holder to the same extent as the holders of the Class A Units.  
           D. 
    Conversion Date  . The date on which a Vested Class O LTIP Unit shall be converted into Class A Units (the    Class O Conversion Date    for such unit) shall be: (i) in the event of a conversion upon the exercise of the Class O Conversion Right, the date on which the Partnership receives the Class O Conversion Notice for the conversion of such Vested Class O LTIP Unit (or, if later, the date upon which such Class O Conversion Notice becomes effective), (ii) in the event of a conversion as a result of a Forced Conversion, upon the effective time of the applicable Sale Event or (iii) in the event of a conversion upon the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Mandatory Conversion Date. 
       
           E. 
    Number of Units Convertible  . A holder of Vested Class O LTIP Units may convert each such Vested Class O LTIP Unit into a number (or fraction thereof) of fully paid and non-assessable Class A Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 4, equal to the Class O LTIP Conversion Factor (as defined below) for such Vested Class O LTIP Unit on the Class O Conversion Date for such Vested Class O LTIP Unit. The    Class O LTIP Unit Conversion Factor    shall mean, for a Class O LTIP Unit as of a particular date, the quotient of (i) the excess of the Class O Conversion Value over the Class O LTIP Unit Participation Threshold (as defined below) for such Class O LTIP Unit as of such date (or, if there is no excess, zero), divided by (ii) the Class O Conversion Value.  The    Class O Conversion Value    of a Class O LTIP Unit as of a particular date means the Common Stock Price multiplied by the Conversion Factor, in each case, as of such date.    Common Stock Price    means, as of a particular date, (i) if shares of the common stock (or other comparable equity interest) of the General Partner Entity (   Common Stock   ), are then listed on a national stock exchange, the closing sales price per share of Common Stock on the exchange for such date (or, if such date is not a trading date or there were no sales on such date, the most recent prior trading date on which  

there was a sale of shares of Common Stock on such exchange), as determined by the General Partner, (ii) if shares of Common Stock are not then listed on a national stock exchange but are then traded on an over-the-counter market, the average of the closing bid and asked prices for the shares of Common Stock in such over-the-counter market for such date (or, if such date is not a trading date or there were not quoted prices on such date, the most recent prior trading date on which there were such quoted prices for such shares of Common Stock in such market), as determined by the General Partner, or (iii) if shares of Common Stock are not then listed on a national stock exchange or traded on an over-the-counter market, such value as the General Partner in its discretion may in good faith determine; provided that, where the shares of common stock are so listed or traded, the General Partner may make such discretionary determinations where the shares of Common Stock have not been traded for 10 trading days; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common Stock Price as of the date of a Sale Event shall be the value, as determined by the General Partner, of the consideration payable, or otherwise to be received by stockholders, per share of Common Stock pursuant to the Sale Event. The    Class O LTIP Unit Participation Threshold    shall mean, for each Class O LTIP Unit, the amount specified as such in the relevant Vesting Agreement or other documentation pursuant to which such Class O LTIP Unit is granted.   
    
           F. 
    Conversion Procedures  . A conversion of Vested Class O LTIP Units for which the holder thereof has given a Class O Conversion Notice or that have converted upon the Mandatory Conversion Date or a Forced Conversion shall occur automatically after the close of business on the applicable Class O Conversion Date without any further action on the part of such holder of Class O LTIP Units, as of which time such holder of Class O LTIP Units shall be credited on the books and records of the Partnership with the issuance of the number of Class A Units issuable upon such conversion. After the conversion of Class O LTIP Units as aforesaid, the Partnership shall deliver to such holder of Class O LTIP Units, upon his or her written request, a certificate of the General Partner certifying the number of Class A Units and remaining Class O LTIP Units, if any, held by such Person immediately after such conversion. 
       
           G. 
    Treatment of Capital Account  . For purposes of making future allocations under Section 6.1.E of the Agreement, the portion of the Economic Capital Account balance of the applicable holder of Class O LTIP Units that is treated as attributable to his or her Class O LTIP Units shall be reduced, as of a Class O Conversion Date, by the product of the number of Class A Units into which such holder s Class O LTIP Units were converted on such date multiplied by the Class A Unit Economic Balance. 
       
           8. 
    Redemption at the Option of the Partnership  . Class O LTIP Units will not be redeemable at the option of the Partnership;   provided  ,   however  , that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Partnership from repurchasing Class O LTIP Units from the holder thereof if and to the extent such holder agrees to sell such units. 
       
           9. 
    Voting Rights. 
       
           A. 
    No Voting Rights  . Except as provided in Section 9.B, holders of Class O LTIP Units shall not have the right to vote on any matters submitted to a vote of the Limited Partners
