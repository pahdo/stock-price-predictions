AND 2015  

1.   
       Description of Business    

QS Energy, Inc. ( QS
Energy ,  Company ) (formerly known as Save the World Air, Inc.) was incorporated on February 18, 1998, as a
Nevada Corporation under the name Mandalay Capital Corporation. The Company changed its name to Save the World Air, Inc. on February
11, 1999. Effective August 11, 2015, the Company changed its name to QS Energy, Inc. The Company s common stock is quoted
under the symbol  QSEP  on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. More information including the Company s fact
sheet, logos and media articles are available at our corporate website,  www.qsenergy.com . 

QS Energy develops
and commercializes energy efficiency technologies that assist in meeting increasing global energy demands, improving the economics
of oil extraction and transport, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Company's intellectual properties include a portfolio
of domestic and international patents and patents pending, a substantial portion of which have been developed in conjunction with
and exclusively licensed from Temple University of Philadelphia, PA ( Temple ). QS Energy's primary technology is called
Applied Oil Technology  (AOT), a commercial-grade crude oil pipeline transportation flow-assurance product. Engineered specifically
to reduce pipeline pressure loss, increase pipeline flow rate and capacity, and reduce shippers  reliance on diluents and
drag reducing agents to meet pipeline maximum viscosity requirements, AOT is a 100% solid-state system that reduces crude oil viscosity
by applying a high intensity electrical field to crude oil feedstock while in transit. The AOT product has transitioned from the
research and development stage to initial production for continued testing in advance of our goal of seeking acceptance and adoption
by the midstream pipeline marketplace. 

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2015 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include all
disclosures, including notes, required by GAAP. 

In the opinion of management,
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to fairly present the
Company's financial position and results of operations for the interim periods reflected. Except as noted, all adjustments contained
herein are of a normal recurring nature. Results of operations for the fiscal periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative
of fiscal year-end results. 

2.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Consolidation Policy   

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements of QS Energy Inc. include the accounts of QS Energy Inc. (the Parent) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, QS
Energy Pool, Inc. and STWA Asia Pte. Limited. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Going Concern   

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,379,688, used cash in operations of $1,401,310
and had a stockholders  deficit of $946,490 as of that date. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s
ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

In addition, the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company's December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements,
has raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

At September 30, 2016,
the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $385,360. Management estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient
to continue operations through January 2017. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of
debt and equity securities for cash to operate our business, including without limitation the expenses it will incur in connection
with the license and research and development agreements with Temple; costs associated with product development and commercialization
of the AOT technology; costs to manufacture and ship the products; costs to design and implement an effective system of internal
controls and disclosure controls and procedures; costs of maintaining our status as a public company by filing periodic reports
with the SEC and costs required to protect our intellectual property. In addition, as discussed below, the Company has substantial
contractual commitments, including without limitation, payment of license and other fees to Temple University, salaries to our
executive officers pursuant to employment agreements, certain payments to a former officer and consulting fees, during the remainder
of 2016 and beyond. 

No assurance can be
given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company.
Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of
debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in case of equity financing. 

Basic and Diluted Income (loss) per
share   

Our computation of
earnings per share ( EPS ) includes basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income (loss) available to
common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects
the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income (loss)
of the Company as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. In computing
diluted income (loss) per share, the treasury stock method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are exercised and the
proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Options and warrants may have a dilutive
effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise
price of the options and warrants. Potential common shares that have an antidilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per
share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. 

Income (loss) per common
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
respective periods. Basic and diluted (loss) per common share is the same for periods in which the Company reported an operating
loss because all warrants and stock options outstanding are anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, we excluded the outstanding
securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock as their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company periodically
issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance
provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and
recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees
in accordance with the authoritative guidance of FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement
date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over
the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the
non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the
measurement date. 

The fair value of the
Company's stock option and warrant grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends.
Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, and based on actual
experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded
in future periods. 

Estimates   

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include
those related to assumptions used in valuing equity instruments issued for financing and services. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Effective January 1,
2008, fair value measurements are determined by the Company's adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception
of the application of the statement to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. The adoption of the authoritative
guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's fair value measurements. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy
was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 

Level 1 Quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs,
other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Unobservable
inputs based on the Company's assumptions. 

The Company is required
to use observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. At September 30, 2016, the carrying amounts
for cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible debentures approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. 

Patent Costs   

Patent costs consist
of patent-related legal and filing fees. Due to the uncertainty associated with the successful development of our AOT and Joule
Heat products, all patent costs are expensed as incurred. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, patent
costs were $49,265 and $35,379, respectively, and were included as part of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, patent costs were $18,891 and $5,525,
respectively, and were included as part of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance
under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require
that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also
will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted
only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Entities will be able to
transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company
is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset
and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective
transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company
is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued the ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
The amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement
when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can
today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures
as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently
evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

Other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's
present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

3.   
       Certain Relationships and Related Transactions    

As of September, 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued expenses and accounts payable to related parties in the amount of $143,151
and $190,750, respectively. Included in these amounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were unpaid salaries due to our
former President and current member of the Company s Board of Directors of $30,429 and $75,429, respectively. The Company
agreed to pay the former President $5,000 per month until the unpaid salary is fully settled. Also included in these amounts at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are accrued directors  fees of $76,089. 

4.   
       Property and Equipment    

At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, property and equipment consists of the following: 

Depreciation expense
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5,249 and $9,803, respectively. During the period ended September
30, 2016, the Company disposed certain property and equipment with aggregate costs of $38,206 and accumulated depreciation of $34,863
which resulted in a loss of $3,343. 

5.   
       Convertible Notes    

During 2014 and 2015,
the Company conducted a private placement and issued approximately $1 million of its unsecured convertible notes for proceeds of
$920,900 or an original issue discount ( OID ) of $85,490. The notes do not bear any interest: however, the implied
interest rate used was 10% because the notes were issued for a purchase price of 10% less than their face value. The notes are
unsecured and mature in twelve months from issuance. The notes are convertible, at the option of the note holder, into the Company s
common stock at conversion prices ranging from $0.10 per share through $0.48 per share. In addition, each note holder also received
a warrant to purchase common stock equivalent to 25% of the number of shares the notes are convertible into or a total of 1,942,704
shares of common stock. Each warrant is exercisable on a cash basis only at prices ranging from $0.10 through $0.48 per share.
The warrants vest immediately upon issuance, and are exercisable for one year from the date of issuance. 

As a result, in
prior periods, the Company recorded a note discount of $842,105 to account for the relative fair value of the warrants,
the notes  beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ), and OID. The note discounts are being amortized over the
life of the note or will be amortized in full upon the conversion of the corresponding notes to common stock. At December
31, 2015, total outstanding notes payable amounted to $321,024 and unamortized note discount was $100,833. 

During the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued similar convertible promissory notes in the amount
of $1,587,045 for cash proceeds of $1,442,769 or a discount of $144,276. The notes do not bear any interest; however,
the implied interest rate used was 10% because the notes were issued for purchase prices of 10% less than their face value.
The notes are unsecured, mature in twelve months from issuance and are convertible at $0.10 per share. In addition, the
Company also granted these note holders warrants to purchase 7,935,225 shares of the Company  common stock. The
warrants are fully vested, exercisable at $0.10 per share and will expire in one year from the date of their issuance. As a
result, the Company recorded a note discount of $1,587,045 to account for the relative fair value of the warrants, the
notes  BCF and OID. The note discounts are being amortized over the life of the note on the effective interest method. 

During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, a total of $1,367,044 of notes payable were converted int o  13,670,449 shares of common
stock and amortized note discount of $1,433,763 was recorded as interest expense. 

As of September
30, 2016, total outstanding notes payable amounted to $541,024 and an unamortized note discount of $254,116. Included in the
Company s outstanding notes payable are three notes in the aggregate of $211,024 that had reached maturity without
conversion and are past maturity and are currently due with accrued interest in the amount of $17,836. During
the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, the Company accrued interest of $15,831 pursuant to the terms of the notes.
As of September 30, 2016, these notes were convertible to 3,776,792 shares of common stock in aggregate. 

6.   
       Research and Development    

Research and development
costs consist of costs of construction, development and testing of the AOT and Joule Heat technologies with internal resources
and through the assistance of various third party entities. Costs incurred and expensed include fees such as testing fees, purchase
of test equipment, pipeline pumping equipment, crude oil tank batteries, viscometers, SCADA systems, computer equipment, payroll
and other related equipment and various logistical expenses for the purposes of evaluating and testing the Company s AOT
and Joule Heat prototypes. In addition, research and development costs also include licensing fees and research and development
fees due to Temple University. 

For the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expenses were $199,772 and $500,517 respectively. For the
three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expenses were $51,595 and $80,082 respectively. 

AOT Product Development and Testing   

In 2014, the Company

Overview  

QS Energy develops
and commercializes energy efficiency technologies that assist in meeting increasing global energy demands, improving the economics
of oil extraction and transport, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Company's intellectual properties include a portfolio
of domestic and international patents and patents pending, a substantial portion of which have been developed in conjunction with
and exclusively licensed from Temple University of Philadelphia, PA ( Temple ). QS Energy's primary technology is called
Applied Oil Technology  (AOT), a commercial-grade crude oil pipeline transportation flow-assurance product. Engineered specifically
to reduce pipeline pressure loss, increase pipeline flow rate and capacity, and reduce shippers  reliance on diluents and
drag reducing agents to meet pipeline maximum viscosity requirements, AOT is a 100% solid-state system that reduces crude oil viscosity
by applying a high intensity electrical field to crude oil feedstock while in transit. AOT technology delivers reductions in crude
oil viscosity and pipeline pressure loss as demonstrated in independent third-party tests performed by the U.S. Department of Energy,
the PetroChina Pipeline R D Center, and ATS RheoSystems, a division of CANNON , at full-scale test facilities in the
U.S. and China, and under commercial operating conditions on one of North America s largest high-volume crude oil pipelines.
The AOT product has transitioned from laboratory testing and ongoing research and development to initial production and continued
testing in advance of our goal of seeking acceptance and adoption by the midstream pipeline marketplace. 

Our Company was incorporated
on February 18, 1998, as a Nevada Corporation under the name Mandalay Capital Corporation. The Company changed its name to Save
the World Air, Inc. on February 11, 1999. Effective August 11, 2015, the Company changed its name to QS Energy, Inc. The name change
was effected through a short-form merger pursuant to Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Additionally, QS Energy Pool,
Inc., a California corporation, was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on July 6, 2015 to serve as a vehicle for
the Company to explore, review and consider acquisition opportunities. The Company s common stock is quoted under the symbol
 QSEP  on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. More information including the Company s fact sheet, logos and
media articles are available at our corporate website,  www.qsenergy.com . 

In 2014, we reached
a major milestone in the Company s evolution, generating revenues from our AOT technology for the first time since our inception
in February 1998. We continue to devote the bulk of our efforts to the promotion, design, testing and the commercial manufacturing
and operations of our crude oil pipeline products in the upstream and midstream energy sector. We anticipate that these efforts
will continue during 2016 and 2017. 

Between 2011 and 2012,
the Company transitioned from prototype testing of its AOT technology at the U.S. Department of Energy Rocky Mountain Oilfield
Testing Center, Midwest, Wyoming ( RMOTC ), to the design and production of full-scale commercial prototype units.
The Company worked in a collaborative engineering environment with multiple energy industry companies to refine the AOT Midstream
commercial design to comply with the stringent standards and qualification processes as dictated by independent engineering audit
groups and North American industry regulatory bodies. In May 2013, the Company s first commercial prototype unit known as
AOT Midstream, was completed. 

In 2013, the Company
entered into an Equipment Lease/Option to Purchase Agreement ( TransCanada Lease ) with TransCanada Keystone Pipeline,
L.P. by its agent TC Oil Pipeline Operations, Inc. ( TransCanada ) which agreed to lease and test the effectiveness of
the Company s AOT technology and equipment on one of TransCanada s operating pipelines. As previously reported in our
10-K report filed with the SEC on March 16, 2015, in June 2014, the equipment was accepted by TransCanada and the lease commenced
and the first full test of the AOT equipment on the Keystone pipeline was performed in July 2014 by Dr. Rongjia Tao of Temple University,
with subsequent testing performed by an independent laboratory, ATS RheoSystems, a division of CANNON  ( ATS )
in September 2014. Upon review of the July 2014 test results and preliminary report by Dr. Tao, QS Energy and TransCanada mutually
agreed that this initial test was flawed due to, among other factors, the short term nature of the test, the inability to isolate
certain independent pipeline operating factors such as fluctuations in upstream pump station pressures, and limitations of the
AOT device to produce a sufficient electric field to optimize viscosity reduction. Subsequent testing by ATS in September 2014
demonstrated viscosity reductions of 8% to 23% depending on flow rates and crude oil types in transit. In its summary report, ATS
concluded that i) data indicated a decrease in viscosity of crude oil flowing through the TransCanada pipeline due to AOT treatment
of the crude oil; and ii) the power supply installed on our equipment would need to be increased to maximize reduction in viscosity
and take full advantage of the AOT technology. While more testing is required to establish the efficacy of our AOT technology,
we are encouraged by the findings of these field tests performed under commercial operating conditions. The TransCanada Lease was
terminated by TransCanada, effective October 15, 2014. Upon termination of the TransCanada Lease, all equipment was uninstalled,
returned, inspected and configured for re-deployment. 

On July 15, 2014, the
Company entered into an Equipment Lease/Option to Purchase Agreement ( Kinder Morgan Lease ) with Kinder Morgan Crude
  Condensate, LLC ( Kinder Morgan ) under which Kinder Morgan agreed to lease and test the effectiveness of the
Company s AOT technology and equipment on one of Kinder Morgan s operating pipelines. Equipment provided under the
Lease includes a single AOT Midstream pressure vessel with a maximum flow capacity of 5,000 gallons per minute. The equipment was
delivered to Kinder Morgan in December 2014 and installed in March 2015. In April 2015, during pre-start testing, low electrical
impedance was measured in the unit, indicating an electrical short. A replacement unit was installed May 2015. The second unit
also presented with low impedance when flooded with crude condensate from Kinder Morgan s pipeline. Subsequent to design
modifications, a remanufactured AOT unit was installed and tested at Kinder Morgan s pipeline facility in in August 2015.
Initial results were promising, with the unit operating generally as expected. However, voltage dropped as preliminary tests continued,
indicating decreased impedance within the AOT pressure vessel. QS Energy personnel and outside consultants performed a series of
troubleshooting assessments and determined that, despite modifications made to the AOT, conductive materials present in the crude
oil condensate continued to be the root cause of the decreased impedance. Based on these results, QS Energy and Kinder Morgan personnel
mutually agreed to hold on final acceptance of equipment under the lease and temporarily suspend in-field testing to provide time
to re-test crude oil condensate in a laboratory setting, and thoroughly review and test selected AOT component design and fabrication.
Subsequent analysis and testing led to changes in electrical insulation, inlet flow improvements and other component modifications.
These design changes were implemented and tested by Industrial Screen and Maintenance (ISM), one of QS Energy's supply chain partners
in Casper, Wyoming. Test performed by ISM at its Wyoming facility indicated significant improvements to system impedance and efficiency
of electric field generation. 

In February 2016, the
modified AOT equipment was installed at Kinder Morgan s facility. Pre-acceptance testing was performed in April 2016, culminating
in more than 24 hours of continuous operations. In-field viscosity measurements and pipeline data collected during this test indicate
the AOT equipment is operating as expected, resulting in viscosity reductions equivalent to those measured under laboratory conditions.
Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) pipeline operating data collected by Kinder Morgan during this test
indicated a pipeline pressure drop reduction consistent with expectations. Kinder Morgan has provided the Company with a number
of additional crude oil samples to be tested in the laboratory for future test correlation and operational planning purposes. Subject
to final review, Kinder Morgan and QS Energy will determine next steps which may include integration of Kinder Morgan s
SCADA system with the AOT control system, 30 days of continued operation during batched pipeline flow, and final installation and
acceptance of the equipment under the lease. 

Southern Research Institute
(SRI) was engaged by QS Energy in 2015 to investigate the root cause of the crude oil condensate impedance issue by replicating
conditions experienced in the field utilizing a laboratory-scaled version of the AOT and crude oil condensate samples provided
by Kinder Morgan. In addition, QS Energy retained an industry expert petroleum pipeline engineer to review the AOT design
and suggest design modifications to resolve the crude oil condensate impedance issue. This engineer has studied design details,
staff reports and forensic photographs of each relevant AOT installation and test. Based on these investigations, specific modifications
were proposed to resolve the impedance issue, and improve the overall efficiency of the AOT device, resulting in a new value-engineered
design of certain AOT internal components. 

The Company is actively
seeking new deployments of its AOT technology. In August, 2015, QS Energy was invited to an offshore oil transfer platform in the
Gulf of Mexico. This offshore platform was assessed by QS Energy personnel for a potential deployment of the AOT viscosity reduction
technology as a solution for super-heavy crude oil flow assurance issues. Following the site visit, subject to non-disclosure agreements
executed by all parties, laboratory testing was performed on crude oil samples provided by the operator, which demonstrated significant
AOT viscosity reductions. Detailed hydraulic analysis based on laboratory results and pipeline operating parameters was presented
to the operator demonstrating potential benefits of AOT technology within the operator s specified infrastructure. Based
on this analysis, the Company was directed by the operator to prepare a preliminary configuration for AOT units optimized for the
operator s high-volume, space-constrained operations. Company engineers and supply chain partners have prepared an optimized
configuration and production budget. Based on this optimized configuration, the operator is considering an onsite pilot test with
full scale AOT equipment for deployment in late 2017. 

In June 2015, the Company
formed a strategic alliance with Norr nt, AS ( Norr nt ), located in Oslo, Norway. Through its affiliation
with Norr nt, the Company is currently in the process of negotiating a collaboration agreement with three Norwegian based
oil companies as well as a potential research grant with the Norwegian Research Council. Under a strategic alliance formed in 2013,
Energy Tech Premier Group is actively marketing AOT technology in Africa and the Middle East. During the first and second quarters
of 2015, oil samples from a Middle Eastern oil company were provided to Temple University for testing. These tests demonstrated
AOT viscosity reductions of 20% to 35% in a laboratory setting. Discussions with this Middle East oil company are ongoing. Effective
May 2016, the Company executed a non-disclosure agreement with a second large Middle East oil company in consideration and evaluation
of potential transactions and joint development activities. Effective July 26, 2016, the Company executed a non-disclosure agreement
with a significant crude oil pipeline manufacturing and installation company located in Beijing, China, for the purpose of developing
a potential sales and distribution relationship targeting the China market. 

During the third quarter
2016, the Company developed a new onsite testing program designed to accelerate the AOT sales cycle. This program utilizes a fully
functional laboratory-scale AOT device designed and developed by the Company in 2015, and tested at the Southern Research Institute.
Under this new program, Company engineers will set up a temporary lab at the customer s site to test a full range of crude
oils. Fees charged for providing this service will be dependent on scope of services, crude oil sample to be tested, and onsite
time requirements. This program has received a positive response from potential customers. We plan to initiate this onsite testing
program in the fourth quarter 2016, with first tests performed in December 2016 or early 2017. 

In 2014, the Company
began development of a new suite of products based around the new electrical heat system which reduces oil viscosity through a
process known as joule heat ( Joule Heat ). The Company is designing and optimizing the Joule Heat technology for the
upstream oil transportation market. The Company filed two provisional patents related to the technology s method and apparatus
in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. The first of the two provisional patents was finalized and submitted
to non-provisional status on April 29, 2014. The second of the two provisional patents was finalized and submitted to non-provisional
status at the end of the third quarter 2014. 

In October 2014, QS
Energy entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Newfield Exploration Company ( Newfield ) to test a prototype
of QS Energy Joule Heat equipment, and combined Joule Heat and AOT technology, on a crude oil pipeline serving the Greater Monument
Butte oilfield located in the Uintah Basin of Utah. This test of the Joule Heat technology provides ideal conditions to demonstrate
efficiency and efficacy. The Uintah Basin is 5,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level with average low winter temperatures of 16 F.
Crude oil pumped from the region is highly paraffinic with the consistency of shoe polish at room temperature. Uintah's black wax
crude must remain at a minimum of 95 F and yellow wax above 115 F and therefore requires a substantial amount of heat
to keep it above its high pour point. Operators in the upstream market often run at temperatures of 140 F to 160 F. Newfield,
like many other companies in the region, incurs significant operating expense in the form of fuel and power used to heat the waxy
crude and counter the cold climate conditions characteristic of Utah. The Company s first Joule Heat prototype was installed
for testing purposes at the Newfield facility in June 2015 and the system is operational; however, changes to the prototype configuration
will be required to determine commercial effectiveness of this unit. During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we worked with
Newfield and Dr. Carl Meinhart to modify the prototype configuration based on observed pipeline and Joule Heat operating factors.
In addition, QS Energy provided a scaled-down version of the Joule Heat unit for static and flow-through testing at SRI. Testing
performed by SRI in September 2015 on a laboratory-scale Joule Heat unit demonstrated the ability of the Joule Heat technology
to deliver temperature increases in the laboratory setting. 

In 2015, the Company
worked in collaboration with Newfield, SRI, Dr. Carl Meinhart, and our manufacturing partner to design and build an AOT prototype
unit, for operations in the upstream crude oil pipeline market ( AOT Upstream ), specifically configured for pipeline
operating factors observed at Newfield s Utah site. Our original plan was to retrofit an earlier prototype device previously
tested at RMOTC; however, after multiple site visits and discussions with Newfield, it was determined a new, smaller unit, specifically
optimized for Newfield operations would be more appropriate for this field test opportunity. We plan to jointly test the AOT Upstream
prototype unit under typical upstream commercial pipeline conditions on Newfield s pipeline in conjunction with the previously
installed Joule Heat unit. 

In December 2015, we
temporarily suspended Joule Heat and AOT Upstream development activities to focus Company resources on finalizing commercial development
of the AOT Midstream. Testing terminated at SRI and all prototype equipment was returned to the Company. We currently plan to resume
Joule Heat and AOT Upstream development in 2017 depending on the availability of sufficient capital and other resources. 

In July 2015, the Company
formed QS Energy Pool, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of QS Energy, Inc., for the sole purpose of taking advantage of asset acquisition
opportunities in the oil and gas operations market. QS Energy Pool is specifically targeting the acquisition of one or more operating
companies or properties with proven positive cash flow, providing operating income and bottom line revenue which are both accretive
to and synergistic with QS Energy, Inc. s current operations. QS Energy has identified multiple attractive opportunities
to acquire producing oil and gas field operations. Our strategy is to acquire producing oil and gas fields with production profiles
of at least ten years, proven long-term development rights, and demonstrated positive cash flow at commodity prices as low as $25/barrel
of oil and $2.00/MCF of gas. Any such acquisitions would be subject on our ability to obtain acquisition financing under acceptable
terms and conditions. To date, we have not acquired any oil and gas properties, and there can be no assurances that we will do
so in the future. We can provide no assurances that acquisition financing would be available to us. 

Our expenses to date
have been funded primarily through the sale of shares of common stock and convertible debt, as well as proceeds from the exercise
of stock purchase warrants and options. We will need to raise substantial additional capital through 2016, and beyond, to fund
our sales and marketing efforts, continuing research and development, and certain other expenses, until our revenue base grows
sufficiently. 

There are significant
risks associated with our business, our Company and our stock. See  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A below. 

Results of Operation for Nine and Three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

The Company had no
revenues in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Operating expenses
were $1,728,129 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,409,551 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $681,422. This is due to decreases in non-cash expenses of $192,681, and in cash expenses of $488,741.
Specifically, the decrease in non-cash expenses are attributable to decreases in depreciation of $4,544 and stock compensation
expenses attributable to the fair value of options granted to directors and employees of $283,171, offset by increases in stock
compensation expenses attributable to the fair value of warrants granted to consultants and others of $95,044. The decrease in
cash expense is attributable to decreases in salaries and benefits of $182,364 ,  legal and accounting of $86,834, travel
and related expenses of $181,125, corporate expenses of $32,846, insurance of $8,829, and other expenses of $9,988, offset by increases
in consulting fees of $332, and rents of $12,932. The increase in rents is due in part to a one-time expense of $35,910 recognized
upon vacating the Santa Barbara Facility in May, 2016 as detailed in Note 10 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

Research and development
expenses were $199,772 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $500,517 for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $300,745. This decrease is attributable to decreases in prototype product development costs of
$210,482, and product testing, research, patents and other costs of $90,263. 

Other income and expense
were $1,451,787 expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $633,010 expense for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2015, a net increase in other expenses of $818,777. This increase is attributable to an increase in non-cash
other expenses of $805,726 and an increase in other expenses of $13,051. The increase in non-cash other expense is due to an increase
in expense attributable to interest, beneficial conversion features and warrants associated with convertible notes issued in the
amount of $805,726. The decrease in other income is due to a decrease in income from sale fixed assets in the amount of 9,708,
and an increase in loss on the disposition of assets in the amount of $3,343. 

The Company had a net
loss of $3,379,688, or $0.02 per share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $3,543,078,
or $0.02 per share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company had no
revenues in the three month-periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Operating expenses
were $467,579 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $727,587 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $260,008. This is due to decreases in non-cash expenses of $62,560, and in cash expenses of $197,448 . 
Specifically, the decrease in non-cash expenses are attributable to decreases in depreciation of $1,689 and stock compensation
expenses attributable to the fair value of options granted to directors and employees of 78,451, offset by increases in stock compensation
expenses attributable to the fair value of warrants granted to consultants and others of $17,580. The decrease in cash expense
is attributable to decreases in salaries and benefits of $84,921, consulting fees of $4,090, corporate expenses of $9,298 ,  insurance
of $14,513 and travel and related expenses of $69,481, rents of $15,561 and other expenses of $93, offset by increases in legal
and accounting of $509. 

Research and development
expenses were $51,595 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $80,082 for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $28,487. This decrease is attributable to decreases in prototype product development costs of
$28,487. 

Other income and expense
were $516,022 expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $18,128 expense for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015, a net increase in other expenses of $497,894. This increase is attributable to an increase decrease in
non-cash other expenses of $490,726 and decrease in other income of $7,168. The increase in non-cash other expense is due to an
increase in expense attributable to interest, beneficial conversion features and warrants associated with convertible notes issued
in the amount of $490,726. The decrease in other income is due to a decrease in income from sale fixed assets in the amount of
$7,168. 

The Company had a net
loss of $1,035,196, or $0.01 per share, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $825,797,
or $0.00 per share, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

General   

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,379,688, used cash in operations
of $1,401,310 and had a stockholders  deficit of $946,490 as of that date. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company s ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

In addition,
the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company's December 31, 2015 financial statements,
has raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

At September
30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $385,360. Management estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient
to continue operations through January 2017. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of
debt and equity securities for cash to operate our business, including without limitation the expenses it will incur in connection
with the license and research and development agreements with Temple; costs associated with product development and commercialization
of the AOT and Joule Heat technologies; costs to manufacture and ship the products; costs to design and implement an effective
system of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures; costs of maintaining our status as a public company by filing
periodic reports with the SEC and costs required to protect our intellectual property. In addition, as discussed below, the Company
has substantial contractual commitments, including without limitation salaries to our executive officers pursuant to employment
agreements, certain payments to a former officer and consulting fees, during the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 

Summary   

During the period ended
September 30, 2016, we received cash totaling $1,442,769 from issuance of our convertible notes payable and used cash in operations
of $1,401,310. At September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand in the amount of $385,360. We will need additional funds to operate our
business, including without limitation the expenses we will incur in connection with the license and research and development agreements
with Temple University; costs associated with product development and commercialization of the AOT and related technologies; costs
to manufacture and ship our products; costs to design and implement an effective system of internal controls and disclosure controls
and procedures; costs of maintaining our status as a public company by filing periodic reports with the SEC and costs required
to protect our intellectual property. In addition, as discussed above, we have substantial contractual commitments, including without
limitation salaries to our executive officers pursuant to employment agreements, certain severance payments to a former officer
and consulting fees, during the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 

No assurance can be
given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. 

Licensing Fees to Temple University   

For details of the
licensing agreements with Temple University, see Financial Statements attached hereto, Note 6 (Research and Development). 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate, on an on-going
basis, our estimates and judgments, including those related to the useful life of the assets. We base our estimates on historical
experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. 

The methods, estimates
and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report
in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies
that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and those that
require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation. For a more detailed discussion of the accounting policies of the
Company, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 

We believe the following
critical accounting policies, among others, require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. 

Estimates   

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Certain significant estimates were made in connection with preparing our consolidated financial statements as described in Note
2 to Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company periodically
issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance
provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized
over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance
with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the stock compensation is based
upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at
which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally
are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance
requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded
in the period of the measurement date. 

The fair value of
the Company's common stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation
expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience.
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future
periods. 

Recent Accounting Polices   

See Note 2 in the accompanying
financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure about Market Risk  

We issue from time
to time fixed rate discounted convertible notes. Our convertible notes and our equity securities are exposed to risk as set forth
below, in Part II Item 1A,  Risk Factors.  Please also see Item 2, above,  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

1.   
       Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The Company's management,
with the participation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2016,
the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, which were designed to be effective at the reasonable assurance
level. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, management, the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level at that date. 

(a)       Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

No change in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  

There is no litigation
of any significance with the exception of the matters that have arisen under, and are being handled in, the normal course of business. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

There have been no
material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015, which we filed with
the SEC on March 15, 2016. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds  

Issuances   

In private offerings
exempt from registration, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 13,670,449 shares of its common stock
upon the conversion of $1,367,044 in convertible notes at $0.10 per share. 

As reported in our
Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2016, from January 1, 2016 through April 20, 2016, the Company issued convertible promissory notes
in the aggregate of $868,745 for cash proceeds of $789,769 or a discount of $78,976. The notes do not bear any interest; however,
the implied interest rate used was 10% because the notes were issued for purchase prices of 10% less than their face value. The
notes are unsecured, mature in twelve months from issuance and are convertible at $0.10 per share. In addition, the Company also
granted these note holders warrants to purchase 4,343,725 shares of the Company  common stock. The warrants are fully vested,
exercisable at $0.10 per share and will expire in one year from the date of their issuance. 

From April 21, 2016,
through September 30, 2016, the Company issued additional convertible promissory notes under the same terms as those described
in our Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2016, in the aggregate of $718,300 for cash proceeds of $653,000 or a discount of $65,300. The
notes do not bear any interest; however, the implied interest rate used was 10% because the notes were issued for purchase prices
of 10% less than their face value. The notes are unsecured, mature in twelve months from issuance and are convertible at $0.10
per share. In addition, the Company also granted these note holders warrants to purchase 3,561,500 shares of the Company 
common stock. The warrants are fully vested, exercisable at $0.10 per share and will expire in one year from the date of their
issuance. 

The offering was made
to non U.S. investors and to U.S.  accredited investors,  as the term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and were made without general advertising or solicitation. The securities
sold in the offering were not registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state, and were offered and sold
in reliance on exemptions from registration including the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act, and corresponding provisions of state securities law, which, respectively,
exempt transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering or transactions with non U.S. Investors. 

The Company issued
300,000 shares of common stock as compensation to consultants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The proceeds received
by the Company in connection with the above issuances of shares were used for general corporate purposes. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

None 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

None 

Item 5. Other Information

shares of common stock upon conversion of previously issued convertible notes in aggregate value of $124,300. These shares
were issued in private offerings exempt from registration.
