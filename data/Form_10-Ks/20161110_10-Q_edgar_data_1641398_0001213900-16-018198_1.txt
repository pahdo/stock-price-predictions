DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   

Organization
and General   

JM
Global Holding Company (the  Company,   we  or  us ) is a newly organized blank check company
incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2015. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction,
one or more operating businesses or assets ( Business Combination ). The Company has neither engaged in any operations
nor generated any operating revenue to date. The Company s sponsor is Zhong Hui Holding Limited, a Seychelles limited company
(the  Sponsor ). The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.  

Financing   

The
registration statement for the Company s initial public offering (the  Public Offering ) (as described in Note
3) was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 23, 2015. The Sponsor
purchased, simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering on July 29, 2015, 250,000 units at $10.00 per unit in a private
placement for an aggregate price of $2,500,000. Each unit purchased is substantially identical to the units sold in the Public
Offering, except that the Sponsor has agreed that it will not seek redemption of the stock contained within such units. In addition,
the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 3,000,000 units in the Public Offering. The Sponsor has agreed that it will not seek redemption
of 1,000,000 shares of the 3,000,000 shares purchased in the Public Offering. In the event that the Company is unable to complete
its initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering, the non-redeemable 1,000,000 Sponsor
shares will be entitled to the liquidation rights described in the  Business Combination  section.  

Upon
the closing of the Public Offering and the private placement, $50,000,000 was placed in a trust account (the  Trust Account ),
with Continental Stock Transfer   Trust Company acting as trustee.  

Liquidity
and Going Concern   

None
of our Sponsor, stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties, are under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest
in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be
required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing
operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that
new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.  

Additionally,
the Company has until July 2017 to complete its initial business combination. If the Company has not completed its initial business
combination by that time, the Company will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, pro rata, to
our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for purposes of the winding up of our affairs.  

These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS  (continued)  

Trust
Account   

An
amount equal to 100% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering received on July 29, 2015 is held in a trust account ( Trust
Account ) invested in U.S. government securities meeting the conditions of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the  Investment Company Act ), having a maturity of 180 days or less or any open-ended investment
company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3)
and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, as determined by the Company until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Business
Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account.  

Other
than the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or for working capital, if any, none of the funds held in trust may be released until
the earlier of: (i) the completion of the Business Combination; or (ii) the redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
included in the units sold in the Public Offering if the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination within 24 months
from the closing of the Public Offering.  

Business
Combination   

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering
and the private placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement are
intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able
to successfully effect a Business Combination.  

The
Company, after signing a definitive agreement for the acquisition of one or more target businesses or assets, may decide to not
submit the transaction for stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by law. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination
if it is approved by the board of directors. In the event that the Company is required to seek stockholder approval in connection
with its initial Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if a majority of the aggregate
outstanding shares that are voted in favor of the Business Combination. In connection with such a vote, the Company will provide
its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon the consummation of its initial Business Combination
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any amounts
representing interest earned on the Trust Account, less any interest released to the Company for working capital purposes or the
payment of taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding shares of common stock that were sold as part of the Units in the
Public Offering, which the Company refers to as its public shares, subject to the limitations described within the registration
statement and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of
terms of a proposed Business Combination. These shares of common stock, excluding the 1,000,000 non-redeemable shares of the 3,000,000
shares purchased in the Public Offering by the Sponsor, are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity
upon the completion of the Public Offering, in accordance with ASC Topic 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity .
However, in no event will the Company redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less
than $5,000,001.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS  (continued)  

The
Company has until 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering (the  Combination Period ) to consummate its initial
Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing
of the Public Offering the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of its affairs; (ii) distribute
the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including a portion of the interest earned thereon which was not previously
used for working capital, but net of any taxes,  pro rata  to its public stockholders by way of redemption of its public
shares (which redemption would completely extinguish such holders  rights as stockholders, including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as possible following such redemption, dissolve and liquidate
the balance of its net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of its plan of dissolution and liquidation; in the event
of such distribution, it is possible that the per-share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including
Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per Unit in the Public Offering.  

Section
102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ) permits emerging growth companies to
delay complying with new or revised financial accounting standards that do not yet apply to private companies (that is, those
that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under
the Exchange Act). The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with
the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company elected
not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application
dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the
time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of its financial statements with another public
company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition
period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (  GAAP  ) for interim information and in accordance with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, since they are interim statements, the
accompanying financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for a complete financial statement
presentation. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual Form 10-K filing. In the
opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments)
that are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods
presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements recognize April 10, 2015 as our date of inception.  

Development
stage company   

The
Company complies with the reporting requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-10, which eliminates certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously
identified as  Development Stage Entities  (Topic 915). The amendments in this ASU simplify accounting guidance by
removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The amendments also reduce date maintenance
and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirements for development stage entities to present
inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders  equity. In accordance with adopting
ASU No. 2014-10, the Company does not present or disclose any information required by Topic 915.  

Net
loss per common share   

The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share.  Net loss
per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could,
potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss
per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the periods presented.  

Concentration
of credit risk   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution
which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these
accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

The
fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures,  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets, primarily
due to their short-term nature.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (continued)  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Income
taxes   

The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of FASB ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  which requires
an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future
taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.  

FASB
ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. No amounts were
accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company is currently not aware of any issues
under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject
to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.  

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by U.S. federal, U.S. states or foreign jurisdiction authorities in the areas
of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income
among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign tax laws. The Company s management
does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Cash
and securities held in Trust Account   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury
Bills.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (continued)  

Deferred
offering costs   

Deferred
offering costs consisted of legal, underwriter and accounting fees incurred that were directly related to the Public Offering
and that were charged to stockholders  equity upon the completion of the Public Offering on July 29, 2015. Deferred Offering
costs amounting to $1,862,816 were charged to stockholders  equity upon completion of the Offering.  

Accrued
expenses and due to affiliate   

Accrued
expenses represents amount the Company owes to its vendors, for which service has been provided but the Company has not paid for
and state franchise tax. At September 30, 2016 there was approximately $61,000 accrued for state franchise tax in the Company s
accrued expenses. At December 31, 2015, there were approximately $4,000 of accrued travel expenses and $39,000 accrued state franchise
tax in the Company s accrued expenses. Due to affiliate represents entity costs and offering costs paid by an affiliate
on behalf of the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand.   

Redeemable
Common Stock   

As
discussed in Note 4, 4,000,000 of the 5,000,000 shares of common stock sold as part of the units in the Public Offering contain
a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of common stock under the Company s liquidation or tender offer/stockholder
approval provisions. In accordance with ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the
security to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation
of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify
a maximum redemption threshold, its charter provides that in no event will it redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would
cause its net tangible assets (stockholders  equity) to be less than $5,000,001.  

Accordingly,
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 4,000,000 of the 5,000,000 Public Shares were classified outside of permanent equity
at its redemption value.  

Recently
issued accounting standards   

The
Company complies with ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern   (  ASU 2014-15  ). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management s responsibility
in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related
footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that
raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial
statements are issued. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016,
and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the methodologies prescribed
by ASU 2014-15, and the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the Company s financial statements.

PUBLIC OFFERING   

On
July 29, 2015, the Company sold 5,000,000 units at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit ( Public Units ) in the Public
Offering. Each Public Unit consists of one share of the Company s common stock, $0.0001 par value, and one common stock
purchase warrant. The Company did not register the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time of
the Public Offering. However, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to file and have an effective registration statement
covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to maintain a current prospectus relating to those
shares of common stock until the earlier of the date the warrants expire or are redeemed and, the date on which all of the warrants
have been exercised and to qualify the resale of such shares under state blue sky laws, to the extent an exemption is not available.
Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per half
share ($11.50 per whole share). Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of common stock. No fractional shares
will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the consummation
of its initial Business Combination, or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering. The warrants will expire at 5:00
p.m., New York time, five years after the consummation of its initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the Trust Account. The
warrants will be redeemable by the Company at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon 30 days prior written notice after the warrants
become exercisable, only in the event that the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $24.00 per share for any
20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which notice of redemption
is given.  

The
Company paid an upfront underwriting discount of $1,250,000 (approximately 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering)
to the underwriters at the closing of the Public Offering. The amount was charged to the additional paid in capital account.  

The
Company sold to the underwriter (and/or its designees), for $100, as additional compensation, an option to purchase up to a total
of 400,000 units exercisable at $10.00 per unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $4,000,000) upon the closing of the Public
Offering. Since the option is not exercisable until the earliest on the closing the initial Business Combination, the option will
effectively represent the right to purchase up to 400,000 shares of common stock and 400,000 warrants to purchase 200,000 shares
at $11.50 per full share for an aggregate maximum amount of $6,300,000. The units issuable upon exercise of this option are identical
to those issued in the Public Offering. (See Note 5).

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Founder
shares   

In
April 2015, the Sponsor purchased 1,504,688 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Founder Shares ) for
$25,000, or $0.01662 per share, which included an aggregate of 192,188 Founder Shares that were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor
to the extent that the overallotment option was not exercised by the underwriter. In June 2015, our Sponsor transferred 164,063
Founder Shares to each of Tim Richerson, our Chief Executive Officer, and Peter Nathanial, our President, as well as 3,000 Founder
Shares to each of Messrs. Jetta and Qu, our independent directors. These 334,126 Founder Shares were not subject to forfeiture
in the event the underwriter s overallotment option was not exercised in full. The Founder Shares are identical to the shares
of common stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that (1) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer
restrictions, as described in more detail below, and (2) our initial stockholders have agreed: (i) to waive their redemption rights
with respect to their founder shares in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing
of the Public Offering. However, our initial stockholders will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares
they hold by way of public market purchase if we fail to consummate a Business Combination within such time period. If we submit
our initial Business Combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote theirshares
and any public shares held in favor of our initial Business Combination. The initial stockholders will own founder shares equal
to 20.0% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares.  

On
September 8, 2015, the Sponsor forfeited 192,188 Founder Shares since the overallotment was not exercised, so that the initial
stockholders own 20.0% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  

Our
initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until one year after our initial
Business Combination (the  lock up ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of our common stock equals
or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for
any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial Business Combination, or if
we consummate a transaction after our initial Business Combination which results in our stockholders having the right to exchange
their shares for cash or property, the Founder Shares will be released from the lock-up.  

The
Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 3,000,000 units in the Public Offering. The Sponsor has agreed that it will not seek redemption
of 1,000,000 shares included in such units.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  (continued)  

Private
Placement   

In
July 2015, the Sponsor purchased 250,000 placement units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase
one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75 per half share, at a price of $10.00 per unit ($2,500,000 in the aggregate,)
in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion of the Public Offering. In addition, possible working
capital loans by our Sponsor, management team, their affiliates and other third parties may be converted into warrants of the
post-business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant (a maximum of 1,000,000 warrants if up to $500,000 is loaned
and that amount is converted into warrants). The placement warrants, and the loan warrants, if any, are (or will be) identical
to the warrants sold in the Public Offering, except that, if held by our Sponsor or its permitted assigns, they (a) may be exercised
for cash or on a cashless basis; (b) are not subject to being called for redemption and (c) they (including the common stock issuable
upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders
until 30 days after the consummation of our initial Business Combination. The Sponsors have agreed that the warrants purchased
will not be sold or transferred until 30 days following consummation of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions.
If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, then the proceeds will be part of the liquidating distribution to the
public stockholders and the warrants issued to the initial stockholders will expire worthless.  

The
private placement warrants and the common shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants will not be transferable,
assignable or salable until 30 days after the consummation of our initial Business Combination and the placement warrants will
be non-redeemable so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees. If the private placement warrants are
held by someone other than the Sponsor, or its respective permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable
by us and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering.  

Due
to Affiliates   

For
the period from April 10, 2015 (inception) through September 30, 2016, the Company s Sponsor advanced to us a total, net
of repayments, of $140,500 which has been used for the payment of costs associated with the Public Offering. These advances are
non-interest bearing and unsecured. Total amounts due to the sponsor were $140,500 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.   

For
the period from April 10, 2015 (inception) through September 30, 2016, an officer of the Company advanced us approximately $53,000
for expenses related to the Public Offering. These advances were repaid as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of
our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate
an initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment, other than the interest income earned thereon. Up to $1,000,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of
the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants. The terms of such loans by our SponsorS, officers and directors,
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

The
underwriter was entitled to an underwriting discount of two and a half percent (2.5%), which was paid in cash.  

The
Company sold to the underwriter (and/or its designees), for $100, as additional compensation, an option to purchase up to a total
of 400,000 units exercisable at $10.00 per unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $4,000,000) upon the closing of the Public
Offering. Since the option is not exercisable until the earliest on the closing of our initial Business Combination, the option
will effectively represent the right to purchase up to 400,000 shares of common stock and 400,000 warrants to purchase 200,000
shares at $11.50 per full share for an aggregate maximum amount of $6,300,000. The units issuable upon exercise of this option
are identical to those offered in the Public Offering. This option may be exercised during the five-year period from the date
of the Public Offering commencing on the later of the consummation of an initial Business Combination and the one-year anniversary
of the date of the Public Offering. The Company accounts for the fair value of the unit purchase option, net of the receipt of
the $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders  equity. The
Company estimates the fair value of this unit purchase option is approximately $2.02 per unit (for a total fair value of approximately
$669,114) using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the unit purchase option granted to the underwriter is
estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 11.15%, (2) risk-free interest rate
of 1.36% and (3) expected life of 5 years. Because the Company s units do not have a trading history, the volatility assumption
is based on information currently available to management. The volatility assumption was calculated using the average volatility
of exchange-traded funds tracking various indices, which are representative of the sectors on which the company intends to focus
for the initial business transaction, including: Fidelity Select Consumer Staples Portfolio, Rydex Consumer Products Fund, Icon
Consumer Staples, Putnam Global Consumer Fund, and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF. The Company believes that the volatility estimate
is a reasonable benchmark to use in estimating the expected volatility of the units. Although an expected life of five years was
used in the calculation, if the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within the prescribed time period and it liquidates,
the option will become worthless. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a  cashless  basis, at
the holder s option, such that the holder may use the appreciated value of the unit purchase option (the difference between
the exercise prices of the unit purchase option and the underlying warrants and the market price of the Units and underlying shares
of common stock) to exercise the unit purchase option without the payment of cash.

TRUST ACCOUNT   

A
total of $50,000,000, which includes $47,500,000 of the net proceeds from the Public Offering and $2,500,000 from the sale of
the Private Warrants, has been placed in the Trust Account. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance in the
Trust Account was $50,076,860 and $50,023,363, respectively.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
Trust Account consisted of $50,061,822 in U.S. Treasury Bills, $6,542 in accrued interest and $8,496 in cash. As of December 31,
2015, the Company s Trust Account consisted of $49,994,122 in U.S. Treasury Bills, $21,485 in accrued interest and $7,756
in cash. The Company classifies its U. S. Treasury and equivalent securities as held-to-maturity in accordance with FASB ASC 320
 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities . Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has
the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 balance sheets and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

The
Company complies with ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement , for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured
and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported
at fair value at least annually.   

The
following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company
utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable
such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points
for the asset or liability, and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability:

STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

Common
stock   

On October 30, 2015, the Company entered
into a twelve-month consulting agreement (the  Agreement ) with FirsTrust China Ltd. (the  Consultant ),
pursuant to which the Consultant agreed to provide advisory services relating to potential business combination transactions and
the Company agreed to pay the Consultant a monthly fee of $20,000, payable quarterly in advance. In addition, the Company agreed
to issue to the Consultant 20,000 restricted shares of the Company s common stock upon the closing of the Company s
initial Business Combination. The Company estimated the fair value of the shares issuable to the Consultant to be $195,200 and
has expensed on a pro-rata basis over the term of the contract. The Consultant is entitled to piggy-back registration rights relating
to such shares similar to the piggy-back registration rights granted to the Company s initial stockholders. The Company recorded
$150,134 in its consulting expenses during the second quarter of 2016. 

On June 10, 2016, the Company and the Consultant entered into a termination agreement, pursuant to which the
Company and Consultant mutually agreed to terminate the Agreement in exchange for a $60,000 termination fee. Further, the Consultant
agreed that the Company shall have no further obligations to the Consultant, including but not limited to the Company s obligation
to issue shares to the Consultant upon the closing of the Company s initial business combination. Accordingly, the Company
wrote off the unamortized $65,066 prepaid consulting expenses. 

The
Company is authorized to issue 15,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Company s
common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock. At September 30, 2016, there were 6,562,500 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding (including 4,000,000 shares of common stock subject to redemption).  

Preferred
stock   

The
Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. At September 30, 2016,
there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The rights privileges, restrictions and conditions of the preferred
shares have not been determined.  

Options  

In July 2016, the board of directors of the
Company appointed two new directors. In August, the Sponsor has granted an option to each of the two new directors to
acquire 6,000 shares of common stock at a price of $9.79 per share exercisable commencing six months after closing of the
initial Business Combination and expiring five years from the closing of the initial Business Combination. The Company
estimates the fair value of the purchase options at $15,546 using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recorded $15,546
as compensation expenses accordingly.

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain information contained in the discussion
and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  

Overview   

We
are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We consummated our initial public offering
on July 29, 2015. We are currently in the process of evaluating and identifying targets for a business combination. We are evaluating
acquisition opportunities and, at any given time, may be in various stages of due diligence or preliminary discussions with respect
to a number of potential acquisitions. From time to time, we may enter into non-binding letters of intent, but we are currently
not subject to any definitive agreement with respect to any business combination. However, we cannot assure you that we will identify
any suitable target candidates or, if identified, that we will be able to complete the acquisition of such candidates on favorable
terms or at all. While we currently intend to consummate our initial business combination with a target business in the consumer
products industry in the United States, we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement of the placement
units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.  

The
issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination:  

may
    significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering;   

may
    subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common
    stock;   

could
    cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things,
    our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present
    officers and directors;   

may
    have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a
    person seeking to obtain control of us; and   

may
    adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and/or warrants.   

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities, it could result in:  

default
    and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our
    debt obligations;   

acceleration
    of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain
    covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;   

our
    immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand and the lender
    demands payment;   

limitations
    on our ability to obtain additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to incur debt;   

our
    inability to pay dividends on our common stock due to covenants limiting or prohibiting dividends;   

using
    a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce, or possibly eliminate,
    the funds available for use as dividends on our common stock, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general
    corporate purposes; and   

limitations
    on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate.   

As
indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at September 30, 2016, we had approximately $210,000 in cash. We expect to
incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business
combination will be successful.  

Results
of Operations   

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. For the period from April 10, 2015 (inception) through
September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $693,689 and incurred costs of $1,862,816 related to the our initial public offering
which have been charged to stockholders  equity.  

The Company s entire activity
from April 10, 2015 (inception) through July 29, 2015, was in preparation for our initial public offering, which was consummated
on July 29, 2015. Since that date, we have engaged in a search for a business combination. Our operating costs since then include
our search for an initial business combination and are largely associated with our governance and public reporting, consulting
fees, director fees, and state franchise taxes which aggregated approximately $737,000 through September 30, 2016. Investment income
of approximately $77,000 represents the realized and unrealized appreciation on our investment in U.S. treasury bills since our
initial public offering. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating costs included our search for an initial
business combination and are largely associated with our governance and public reporting, director fees and consulting fees of
approximately $96,000 and we recorded approximately $18,000 in investment income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
our operating costs included our search for an initial business combination and are largely associated with our governance and
public reporting, director fees and consulting fees of approximately $513,000 and we recorded approximately $53,000 in investment
income. We may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, stockholders, officers,
directors, or third parties. In order to fund transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates or other third parties may loan us additional amounts, provided any
such loans will not have any claim on the proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon completion
of an initial business combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use a portion of any working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts; however, no proceeds from the trust account may be used for
such repayment, other than interest income earned thereon. If such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts, the unpaid
amounts would be forgiven. Any part or all of such loans may be converted into additional warrants at $0.50 per warrant (a maximum
of 1,000,000 warrants if up to $500,000 is loaned and that amount is converted into warrants) of the post-business combination
entity at the option of such parties. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to our sponsor. None of
our sponsors, stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties, are under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest
in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be
required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing
operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new
financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, pursuant to Section
107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B) for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. We will therefore delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards
that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We may
take advantage of this extended transition period until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an  emerging growth
company  or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section
7(a)(2)(B). As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

Upon
the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial statements and has a different effective date
for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and
the date on which we will adopt the recently-issued accounting standard.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $210,434. Until the consummation of our initial public offering on July 29, 2015, the Company s
only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of our shares of common stock and a series of advances made by an affiliate of
the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing and unsecured.  

On
July 29, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 5,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Simultaneously with
the consummation of our initial public offering, we consummated the private sale of 250,000 placement units to our sponsor. Each
private placement unit consists of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock
at a price of $5.75 per half share, at a price of $10.00 per unit ($2,500,000 in the aggregate). We received net proceeds from
our initial public offering and the private placement of approximately $50,650,000, net of the underwriting commissions and fees
of $1,250,000 and offering costs and other expenses of approximately $600,000. $50,000,000 of the proceeds of our initial public
offering and the private placement have been deposited in the trust account and are not available to us for operations (except
amounts designated to pay taxes and working capital from the interest accrued). At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $210,000
of cash available outside of the trust account to fund our activities to search for an initial business combination.  

As
of September 30, 2016, $50,076,860 was held in the Trust Account and we had cash outside of trust of $ 210,434 and $737 in accounts
payable, $61,365 in accrued expenses and $140,500 in due to affiliates. Through September 30, 2016, the Company had not withdrawn
any funds from interest earned on the trust proceeds. Furthermore, no amounts are payable to the underwriters of our initial public
offering in the event of a business combination.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K
and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. We have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities
or entered into any options on non-financial assets.  

Contractual
Obligations   

We
do not have any long term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or purchase obligations.   

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of interim financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We
have identified the following as our critical accounting policies:  

Development
stage company   

The
Company complies with the reporting requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-10, which eliminates certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously
identified as  Development Stage Entities  (Topic 915). The amendments in this ASU simplify accounting guidance by
removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The amendments also reduce date maintenance
and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirements for development stage entities to present
inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders  equity. In accordance with adopting
ASU No. 2014-10, the Company does not present or disclose any information required by Topic 915.  

Net
loss per common share   

The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share.  Net loss
per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could,
potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss
per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the periods presented.  

Concentration
of credit risk   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution
which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these
accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

The
fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures,  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets, primarily
due to their short-term nature.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Income
taxes   

The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of FASB ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  which requires
an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future
taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.  

FASB
ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016. No amounts were accrued
for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2016. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review
that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income
tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.  

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by U.S. federal, U.S. states or foreign jurisdiction authorities in the areas
of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income
among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign tax laws. The Company s management
does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.   

Cash
and cash equivalents   

The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Cash
and securities held in Trust Account   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in cash and U.S.
Treasury Bills.  

Deferred
offering costs   

Deferred
offering costs consisted of legal, underwriter and accounting fees incurred that were directly related to the Public Offering
and that were charged to stockholders  equity upon the completion of the Public Offering on July 29, 2015. Offering costs
amounting to $1,862,186 were charged to stockholders  equity upon completion of the Offering.  

Accrued
expenses and due to affiliates   

Accrued
expenses represents amounts the Company owes to its vendors, for which service has been provided but the Company has not paid
for and state franchise tax. At September 30, 2016 there was approximately $$61,000 accrued for state franchise tax in the Company s
accrued expenses. At December 31, 2015, there were approximately $4,000 of accrued travel expenses and $39,000 accrued state franchise
tax in the Company s accrued expenses. Due to affiliates represents entity formation costs and offering costs paid by an
affiliate on behalf of the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand.  

Redeemable
Common Stock   

4,000,000
of the 5,000,000 common stock sold as part of the units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the
redemption of common stock under the Company s liquidation or tender offer/stockholder approval provisions. In accordance
with ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the security to be classified outside
of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity
instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold,
its charter provides that in no event will it redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (stockholders 
equity) to be less than $5,000,001.  

Accordingly,
at September 30, 2016, 4,000,000 of the 5,000,000 Public Shares were classified outside of permanent equity at its redemption
value.  

Recently
issued accounting standards    

The
Company complies with the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern   (  ASU 2014-15  ). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management s
responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern
and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the
date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for annual reporting periods ending after
December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the methodologies
prescribed by ASU 2014-15, and the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will not have a material effect on its financial position or results
of operations.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

All
activity through July 29, 2015 relates to our formation and the preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since then we have
been actively searching for a proposed business combination. We did not have any financial instruments that were exposed to market
risks at September 30, 2016.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.
Based upon his evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.  

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
