     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1   General 
 Allergan plc is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative branded pharmaceuticals ( brand ,  branded  or  specialty brand ) and select over-the-counter ( OTC ) products.  Prior to completing the Teva Transaction (defined below), the Company also sold high-quality generic and OTC medicines and biologic products for patients around the world. 
 Allergan markets a portfolio of best-in-class products that provide valuable treatments for the central nervous system, eye care, medical aesthetics, gastroenterology, women's health, urology, and anti-infective therapeutic categories, and operated the world's third-largest global generics business, providing patients around the globe with increased access to affordable, high-quality medicines. Allergan is an industry leader in research and development, with one of the broadest development pipelines in the pharmaceutical industry. 
 With commercial operations in over 100 countries, Allergan is committed to working with physicians, healthcare providers and patients to deliver innovative and meaningful treatments that help people around the world live longer, healthier lives. Warner Chilcott Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc and has the same principal business activities.  As a result of the Allergan Acquisition (defined below) which closed on March 17, 2015, the Company expanded its franchises to include ophthalmology, neurosciences and medical aesthetics/dermatology/plastic surgery, which complemented the Company s existing central nervous system, gastroenterology, women s health and urology franchises. The combined company benefits significantly from Allergan, Inc s. ( Legacy Allergan ) global brand equity and consumer awareness of key products, including Botox    and Restasis   . The Allergan Acquisition also expanded our presence and market and product reach across many international markets, with strengthened commercial positions across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. 
 On July 26, 2015 we entered into a master purchase agreement (the  Teva Agreement ), under which Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ( Teva ) agreed to acquire our global generic pharmaceuticals business and certain other assets (the  Teva Transaction ).  Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction on August 2, 2016, we received $33.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired by Teva,  which includes estimated working capital and other contractual adjustments,  and 100.3 million unregistered Teva ordinary shares (or American Depository Shares with respect thereto), which approximated $5.0 billion in value using the closing date Teva opening stock price discounted at a rate of 5.9 percent due to the lack of marketability.  The Company recognized a gain on the sale of our global generics business of $15,881.5 million as well as deferred liabilities relating to other elements of our arrangements with Teva of $518.9 million.  
 As part of the Teva Agreement, Teva acquired our global generics business, including the United States ( U.S. ) and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic research and development ( R D ) unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and certain established international brands.  
 On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva  for an additional $500.0 million . Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, brand, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offices across the U.S.   
 As a result of the Teva Transaction and the divestiture of the Company s Anda Distribution business, and in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) number 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity , the Company is accounting for the assets and liabilities divested as held for sale.  Further, the financial results of the businesses held for sale have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.  The results of our discontinued operations include the results of our generic product development, manufacturing and distribution of off-patent pharmaceutical products, certain established international brands marketed similarly to generic products and out-licensed generic pharmaceutical products primarily in Europe through our Medis third-party business through August 2, 2016, as well as our Anda Distribution business.   
   The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( Annual Report ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have  
 11 

been condensed or omitted from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accompanying year end consolidated balance sheet was derived from the audited financial statement  s included in the Annual Report as revised for discontinued operations treatment of our Anda Distribution business. The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for   a fair statement of the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. All intercompany trans  actions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows th  at it may achieve in future periods.  
 In connection with the Allergan Acquisition, the Company changed its name from Actavis plc to Allergan plc.  Actavis plc s ordinary shares were traded on the NYSE under the symbol  ACT  until the opening of trading on June 15, 2015, at which time Actavis plc changed its corporate name to  Allergan plc  and changed its ticker symbol to  AGN.   Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), Allergan plc is the successor issuer to Actavis plc s ordinary shares which are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Allergan plc is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 References throughout to  we,   our,   us,  the  Company  or  Allergan  refer to financial information and transactions of Allergan plc. References to  Warner Chilcott Limited  refer to Warner Chilcott Limited, the Company s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries. 

NOTE 2   Reconciliation of Warner Chilcott Limited results to Allergan plc results 
 Warner Chilcott Limited is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (together with other Warner Chilcott Limited parents, the  Parent ), the ultimate parent of the group. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan plc. Due to the deminimis activity between Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this filing relate to both Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. Warner Chilcott Limited representations relate only to itself and not to any other company. 
 Except where otherwise indicated, and excluding certain insignificant cash and non-cash transactions at the Allergan plc level, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both separate registrants, Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. In addition to certain inter-company payable and receivable amounts between the entities, the following is a reconciliation of the financial position and results of operations of Warner Chilcott Limited to Allergan plc ($ in millions): 

12 

The difference between accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2016 primarily relates to accruals for the Company s share repurchase program and dividends payable which are held by Allergan plc. The difference between general and administrative expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were due to corporate related expenses incurred at Allergan plc as well as transaction costs. Movements in equity are due to historical differences in the results of operations of the companies and differences in equity awards. 

NOTE 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 The following are interim updates to certain of the policies described in  Note 4  of the notes to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Annual Report. 
 Reclassifications  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the classification of debt issuance costs from being an asset on the balance sheet to netting the costs against the carrying value of the debt. As a result, the Company reclassified debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015 by decreasing  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and  current portion of long-term debt and capital leases  by $36.3 million as well as decreasing  investments and other assets  and  long-term debt and capital leases  by $159.5 million.  In addition, the Company made certain presentation reclassifications relating to segment results and guarantor financial statements.  
 Revenue Recognition  
 General 
 Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss to the product transfers to the customer, which is based on the transaction shipping terms. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds, the seller s price to the buyer to be fixed or determinable and the completion of all performance obligations. The Company warrants products against defects and for specific quality standards, permitting the return of products under certain circumstances. Product sales are recorded net of all sales-related deductions including, but not limited to: chargebacks, trade discounts, sales returns and allowances, commercial and government rebates, customer loyalty programs and fee-for-service arrangements with certain distributors, which we refer to in the aggregate as  SRA  allowances. 
 Royalty and commission revenue is recognized as a component of net revenues in accordance with the terms of their respective contractual agreements when collectability is reasonably assured and when revenue can be reasonably measured. 
 Provisions for SRAs 
   As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes gross revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which reduces the product revenues. Accounts receivable and/or accrued liabilities are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount depending on whether we have the right of offset with the customer. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship of the deductions to gross product revenues, government regulations, estimated utilization  
 13 

or redemption rates, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms. The estimation proc  ess used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on a consistent basis and no material revenue adjustments have been necessary to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company use  s a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of the SRA reserves to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated.  
 Chargebacks    A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference between the invoice price paid by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price that the wholesaler s customer pays for that product. The chargeback provision and related reserve varies with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at certain contract prices. The Company validates the chargeback accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent the vast majority of the recipients of the Company s chargeback payments. We continually monitor current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.  
 Rebates    Rebates include volume related incentives to direct and indirect customers, third-party managed care and Medicare Part D rebates, Medicaid rebates and other government rebates. Rebates are accrued based on an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into trade by the Company. Volume rebates are generally offered to customers as an incentive to use the Company s products and to encourage greater product sales. These rebate programs include contracted rebates based on customers  purchases made during an applicable monthly, quarterly or annual period. The provision for third-party rebates is estimated based on our customers  contracted rebate programs and the Company s historical experience of rebates paid. Any significant changes to our customer rebate programs are considered in establishing the provision for rebates. The provisions for government rebates are based, in part, upon historical experience of claims submitted by the various states / authorities, contractual terms and government regulations. We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on our provision.  
 Cash Discounts    Cash discounts are provided to customers that pay within a specific period. The provision for cash discounts is estimated based upon invoice billings and historical customer payment experience. The Company s experience of payment history is fairly consistent and most customer payments qualify for the cash discount.  
 Returns and Other Allowances    The Company s provision for returns and other allowances include returns, promotional allowances and loyalty cards.  
 Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows customers to return product for a credit. In accordance with the Company s policy, credits for customer returns of products are applied against outstanding account activity or are settled in cash. Product exchanges are not permitted. Customer returns of product are generally not resalable. The Company s estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience and current trends of actual customer returns. Additionally, we consider other factors when estimating the current period returns provision, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, as well as significant market changes which may impact future expected returns. 
 Promotional allowances are credits that are issued in connection with a product launch or as an incentive for customers to carry our product. The Company establishes a reserve for promotional allowances based upon contractual terms. 
 Loyalty cards allow the end user patients a discount per prescription and are accrued based on historical experience, contract terms and the volume of product and cards in the distribution channel. 
 Accounts receivable balances in the Company s consolidated financial statements are presented net of SRA estimates. SRA balances in accounts receivable were $243.8 million and $245.2 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. SRA balances within accounts payable and accrued expenses were $1,797.3 million and $1,570.0 million at September 30, 2016  and December 31, 2015, respectively. The movements in the SRA reserve balances for continuing operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows ($ in millions):  

14 

The provisions recorded to reduce   gross product sales to net product sales, excluding discontinued op  erations, were as follows ($ in   millions):  

The Company s divested generics business also had the following type of SRA s:  

Pricing adjustments, included shelf stock adjustments which are credits issued to reflect price decreases in selling prices charged to the Company s direct customers. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product our customers have in their inventory at the time of an agreed-upon price reduction. The provision for shelf stock adjustments was based upon specific terms with the Company s customers and includes estimates of existing customer inventory levels based upon their historical purchasing patterns.      

Billback adjustments are credits that are issued to certain customers who purchase directly from us as well as indirectly through a wholesaler. These credits are issued in the event there was a difference between the customer s direct and indirect contract price. The provision for billbacks was estimated based upon historical purchasing patterns of qualified customers who purchase product directly from us and supplement their purchases indirectly through our wholesale customers.       

 The Company s SRA reserves relating to discontinued operations were $15.5 million and $1,738.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite-Lives 
 General 
 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the second quarter by comparing the fair value of each of the Company s reporting units to the respective carrying value of the reporting units. Additionally, the Company may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units. 
 Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and this could result in a material impact to net income / (loss) and earnings / (loss) per share. 
 Acquired in-process research and development ( IPR D ) intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the date acquired, represent the right to develop, use, sell and/or offer for sale a product or other intellectual property that the Company has acquired with respect to products and/or processes that have not been completed or approved. The IPR D intangible assets are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of each project. Upon abandonment, the assets are impaired. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows for each year for each project or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, research and development ( R D ) costs, selling and marketing costs and other costs which may be allocated), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the IPR D projects include legal risk, market risk and regulatory risk. Changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment charges. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 
 15 

Upon successful c  ompletion of each project and approval of the product, we will make a separate determination of the useful life of the intangible, transfer the amount to currently marketed products ( CMP ) and amortization expense will be recorded over the estimated usefu  l life.  
 Annual Testing 
 In connection with the realignment of the Company s operating segments in the second quarter of 2016, goodwill was reallocated to reporting units under the new segment structure.  The Company evaluated goodwill for six reporting units during the second quarter of 2016.  The Company performed its annual impairment test utilizing long-term growth rates for its reporting units ranging from 0% to 2.5% in its estimation of fair value and discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.5%.  The factors used in evaluating goodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management. Changes in the key assumptions by management can change the results of testing. The Company determined there was no impairment associated with goodwill. 
 During 2016, the Company tested its indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets for impairment noting no impairment. 
 The Company performed its annual IPR D impairment test during 2016 noting the impairment of an international eye care pipeline project of $35.0 million based on a decrease in projected cash flows due to market conditions as well as an impairment of $20.0 million for a specified indication of a Botox therapeutic product based on a decrease in projected cash flows due to a decline in market demand assumptions.  In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company impaired IPR D projects relating to women s healthcare for $24.0 million and osteoarthritis for approximately $190.0 million based on clinical results and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company impaired a gastroenterology project for $42.0 million based on the lack of future availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients.   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a $197.6 million impairment related to IPR D for select projects as the Company revised its sales forecast of certain assets as well as the timing of the launch of certain projects in connection with the Company s annual review.  In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company made the decision to abandon a select IPR D asset (acquired in connection with the Allergan Acquisition) based on  review of research studies, resulting in an impairment of the full asset value of $300.0 million. 
 Litigation and Contingencies 
 The Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business, including product liability litigation, intellectual property litigation, employment litigation and other litigation. Additionally, the Company, in consultation with its counsel, assesses the need to record a liability for contingencies on a case-by-case basis in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 450  Contingencies  ( ASC 450 ). Accruals are recorded when the Company determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or as additional information becomes available. Acquired contingencies in business combinations are recorded at fair value to the extent determinable, otherwise in accordance with ASC 450. Refer to  NOTE 20   Commitments and Contingencies  for more information. 
 Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) 
 The Company computes EPS in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260 ) and related guidance, which requires two calculations of EPS to be disclosed: basic and diluted. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net (loss) / income by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding during a period. Diluted EPS is based on the treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of ordinary shares, such as shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units. Diluted EPS also includes the impact of ordinary share equivalents to be issued upon the mandatory conversion of the Company s preferred shares. Ordinary share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

A reconc  iliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted EPS consisted of the following ($ in millions, except per share amounts):  

Stock awards to purchase 4.4 million and 4.7 million ordinary shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because the awards were anti-dilutive for continuing operations and as such the treatment for discontinued operations is also anti-dilutive. The weighted average impact of ordinary share equivalents of 17.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which are anticipated to result from the mandatory conversion of the Company s preferred shares were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would be anti-dilutive.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has repurchased 12.8 million shares under the Company s share repurchase program.  The impact of the share repurchase on basic EPS was 3.2 million weighted average shares and 1.1 million weighted average shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Refer to  NOTE 16  Shareholder s Equity  for further discussion on the Company s Share Repurchase Program. 
 Stock awards to purchase 5.1 million and 5.2 million ordinary shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because the impact of the awards were anti-dilutive for continuing operations and as such the treatment for discontinued operations is also anti-dilutive. The weighted average impact of ordinary share equivalents of 17.6 million and 13.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which are anticipated to result from the mandatory conversion of the Company s preferred shares were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would be anti-dilutive.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), with an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within  
 17 

that reporting period, for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans. The   effective date for ASU 2014-09 was deferred by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date  , to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting   periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.   The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, t  he pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, which changes the requirement to require equity securities (including other ownership interests, such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures, and limited liability companies) to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, which states that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. This guidance eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when there is an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The amendments relate to when another party, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer. Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (i.e., the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (i.e., the entity is an agent). The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company is evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations .  
 In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations. 
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments do not change the core revenue recognition principle in Topic 606. The amendments provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients, which include assessing the specific collectability criterion and accounting for contracts that do not meet the criteria for Step 1 to determine whether a contract is valid and represents a genuine transaction; presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers; noncash consideration; contract modifications at transition; and completed contracts at transition. The amendments also clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption, however, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations.

In June 2016, the FASB   issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financi  al instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.     The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets including trade receivables held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current condit  ions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates.     The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fi  scal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.      Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the   pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on specific cash flow issues including: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4) Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and (9) Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the pronouncement will have on our statement of cash flows. 
 In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. The amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. Two common examples of assets included in the scope of the amendments are intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment. The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our financial positions and results of operations .

Acquisitions  
 ForSight VISION 5 
 On September 23, 2016, the Company acquired ForSight VISION 5 ( ForSight ), a privately held, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on eye care, in an all cash transaction of approximately $95.0 million. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired ForSight for an acquisition accounting purchase price of $74.5 million plus the payment of outstanding indebtedness of $14.8 million and other miscellaneous charges. ForSight shareholders are eligible to receive contingent consideration of up to $125.0 million, which has an initial estimated fair value of $79.8 million, relating to commercialization milestones (the  ForSight Acquisition ). The Company acquired ForSight for its lead development program, a peri-ocular ring designed for extended drug delivery and reducing elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in glaucoma patients.  
 Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed at Fair Value 
 The ForSight Acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.  
 The following table summarizes the final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date ($ in millions): 

IPR D and Intangible Assets 
 IPR D intangible assets represent the value assigned to acquired R D projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not established technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The IPR D intangible assets are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project and launch of the product, the Company will make a separate determination of the estimated useful life of the IPR D intangible asset and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life ( IPR D Acquisition Accounting ). 
 The estimated fair value of the IPR D intangible assets was determined using the  income approach,  which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R D costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/asset contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors (the  IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique ). 
 The fair value of the IPR D intangible assets was determined using the IPR D and Intangible Asset Valuation Technique. The discount rate used to arrive at the present value for IPR D intangible assets was 13.0% to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. The discount rate of the acquisition was driven by the early stage of the product and the therapeutic indication. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.   
 Goodwill 
 Among the reasons the Company acquired ForSight and the factors that contributed to the preliminary recognition of goodwill was the expansion of the Company s pipeline of eye care products.  Goodwill from the ForSight Acquisition of $54.2 million was assigned to the US Specialized Therapeutics segment and is non-deductible for tax purposes. 
 20 

Contingent Consideration  
 As part of the acquisition, the Company is required to pay the former shareholders of ForSight up to $125.0 million based on the timing of the first commercial sale, if any.  The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $79.8 million using a probability weighted average approach that considered the possible outcomes of scenarios related to the specified product. 
   Long-Term Deferred Tax Liabilities and Other Tax Liabilities 
 Long-term deferred tax liabilities and other tax liabilities result from identifiable intangible assets  fair value adjustments. These adjustments create excess book basis over the tax basis which is multiplied by the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the deferred taxes exist. 
 Licenses and Other Transactions Accounted for as Asset Acquisitions 
   
 RetroSense Therapeutics, LLC

The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business.  The total upfront net payment of $59.7 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded if the corresponding events become probable.

In addition, Heptares is eligible to receive contingent tiered royalties on net sales of all products resulting from the partnership. The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business. The total upfront payment of approximately $125.0 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded when the event becomes probable.

The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business.  The total upfront net payment of approximately $90.0 million was expensed as a component of R D expense and the future milestones will be recorded if the corresponding events become probable.

The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees and manufacturing as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business.  The Naurex Transaction expands our pipeline with Naurex s two leading product candidates GLYX-13 and NRX-1074, two compounds that utilize NMDA modulation as a potential new approach to the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ), a disease that can lead to suicidality among the most severe patients.

Migraine License  
 On August 17, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Merck   Co. ( Merck ) under which the Company acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to Merck s early development stage investigational small molecule oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, which are being developed for the treatment and prevention of migraines (the  Merck Transaction ). The Merck Transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company acquired these rights for an upfront charge of $250.0 million that was recorded as a component of R D expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees and manufacturing as well as certain other inputs and processes that the transaction did not qualify as a business.  The Company paid $125.0 million of the initial charge in the year ended December 31, 2015 and the remaining $125.0 million was paid in April 2016.

 Divestitures 
 Respiratory Business 
 As part of the Forest Acquisition (defined below), we acquired certain assets that comprised Legacy Forest s branded respiratory business in the U.S. and Canada (the  Respiratory Business ). During the year ended December 31, 2014, we held for sale respiratory assets of $734.0 million, including allocated goodwill to this unit of $309.1 million. On March 2, 2015, the Company sold the Respiratory Business to AstraZeneca plc ( AstraZeneca ) for consideration of $600.0 million upon closing, additional funds to be received for the sale of certain of our inventory to AstraZeneca and low single-digit royalties above a certain revenue threshold. AstraZeneca also paid Allergan an additional $100.0 million and Allergan has agreed to a number of contractual consents and approvals, including certain amendments to the ongoing collaboration agreements between AstraZeneca and Allergan (the  Respiratory Sale ).  As a result of the final terms of the agreement, in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an incremental charge in cost of sales (including the acquisition accounting fair value mark-up of inventory) relating to inventory that will not be sold to AstraZeneca of $35.3 million. The Company recognized a loss in other (expense) income, net of the sale of the business for $5.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 2014 Transactions 
 The following are the significant transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2014. 
 Durata Therapeutics, Inc.  
 On November 17, 2014, the Company completed its tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Durata Therapeutics, Inc. ( Durata ), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for patients with infectious diseases and acute illnesses (the  Durata Acquisition ). The Company purchased all outstanding shares of Durata, which were valued at approximately $724.5 million, including the assumption of debt. Additionally, there is one contingent value right ( CVR ) per share, entitling the holder to receive additional cash payments of up to $5.00 per CVR if certain regulatory or commercial milestones related to Durata s lead product Dalvance    are achieved. The CVR had an acquisition date fair value of $49.0 million. 
 Contingent Consideration  
 At the time of the Durata Acquisition, additional consideration was conditionally due to the seller based upon the approval of Dalvance    in Europe, the approval of a single dose indication and the product reaching certain sales milestones. The Company estimated the acquisition accounting fair value of the contingent consideration to be $49.0 million using a probability weighted approach that considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount rates matched to the timing of the payment, and probability of success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that the European Commission had granted Allergan s subsidiary Durata Therapeutics International B.V., marketing authorization for Xydalba  (dalbavancin) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. The approval triggered the first CVR payment in the quarter ended March 31, 2015 of $30.9 million. In January 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for an expanded label that will include a single dose of Dalvance   , which triggered a second CVR payment of $30.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The difference between the probability weighted fair value and the final payments are recorded as a component of cost of sales.

NOTE 5   Discontinued Operations 
 Global Generics Business  
 On July 27, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into the Teva Transaction, which closed on August 2, 2016.  Under the Teva Agreement, Teva acquired Allergan's global generics business, including the U.S. and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic R D unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and some established international brands.   Allergan retained its global branded pharmaceutical and medical aesthetics businesses, as well as its biosimilars development programs, and certain OTC products. The Company will also have continuing involvement with Teva after the close of the transaction.  As a result of the Teva Transaction, the Company holds equity in Teva and purchases product manufactured by Teva for sale in our US General Medicine segment as part of ongoing transitional service and contract manufacturing agreements. 
 The Company notes the following reconciliation of the proceeds received in the Teva Transaction to the gain recognized in income from discontinued operations ($ in millions): 

In October 2016, pursuant to the Teva Agreement, Teva provided its proposed estimated adjustment to the closing date working capital balance to the Company.  The final amount of any agreed contractual adjustment could vary materially from the adjustment calculated by the Company at the time of the closing of the Teva Transaction and any agreed adjustment to the Company s proceeds from the Teva Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and cash flows.  The Company expects the amount of the adjustment will be determined in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Teva Agreement. 
     
 The Teva Shares are recorded within  Marketable securities  on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a $664.2 million unrealized loss on the Teva Shares due to movements in the share price, which was recorded as a component of  Other comprehensive income.    
   On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business  for an additional $500.0 million . Teva acquired our Anda Distribution business, which distributes generic, brand, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from  
 27 

more than 300 manufacturers to retail independent and chain pharmacies, nursing homes, mail order pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and physician offi  ces across the United States.        
 Financial results of the global generics business through August 2, 2016 and the Anda Distribution business are presented as  Income from discontinued operations  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015; and assets and liabilities of the businesses are presented as  Current assets held for sale ,  Non current assets held for sale ,  Current liabilities held for sale  and  Long term liabilities held for sale  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as applicable. 
 The following table presents key financial results of the businesses included in "Income from discontinued operations" for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):   

Other (expense) income, net  included the gain on sale of the generics business to Teva.   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $5,985.4 million related to investments in certain subsidiaries. The recognition of this benefit has been reflected in  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax  with the deferred tax asset reflected in non-current  Deferred tax liabilities  on the December 31, 2015 balance sheet as adjusted for activity in the fourth quarter of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $474.7 million to adjust its deferred tax asset related to investments in certain subsidiaries. The recognition of this expense has been reflected in  Income from discontinued operations, net of tax.   Upon the closing of the Teva Transaction, the Company recorded the reversal of the corresponding deferred tax asset of $5,273.9 million against the current income taxes payable in continuing operations.

T  he following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities relate  d t  o the businesses ($ in   millions):  

Depreciation and amortization was ceased upon the determination that the held for sale criteria were met, which was the announcement date of the Teva Transaction and June 30, 2016 for the Anda Distribution business. The depreciation, amortization and significant operating and investing non-cash items of the discontinued operations were as follows ($ in millions):  

NOTE 6   Other Income/(Expense)  
 On November 23, 2015, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement (the  Pfizer Agreement ) under which Pfizer Inc. ( Pfizer ), a global innovative biopharmaceutical company, and Allergan plc would merge in a stock and cash transaction.  On April 6, 2016, the Company announced that its merger agreement with Pfizer was terminated by mutual agreement. In connection with the termination of the merger agreement, Pfizer has paid Allergan plc $150.0 million for expenses associated with the transaction which is included as a component of other income (expense) in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  In addition, as part of the then pending Pfizer Agreement, the Company incurred transaction related expenses of $18.0 million and $92.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
 As a result of the Teva Transaction, the Company acquired 100.3 million Teva ordinary shares.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received dividend income of $34.1 million. 

NOTE 7   Share-Based Compensation 
 The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. A summary of the Company s share-based compensation plans is presented below. 
 29 

Equity Award Plans  
 The Company has adopted several equity award plans which authorize the granting of options, restricted shares, restricted stock units and other forms of equity awards of the Company s ordinary shares, subject to certain conditions. 
 The Company granted/grants awards with the following features: 

Time-based vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units awards;     

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards measured to the EBITDA, as defined, of the Company or other performance-based targets defined by the Company;     

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards based on pre-established total shareholder returns metrics;     

Non-qualified options to purchase outstanding shares; and     

Cash-settled awards recorded as a liability. These cash settled awards are based on pre-established total shareholder returns metrics.     

 Option award plans require options to be granted at the fair value of the shares underlying the options at the date of the grant and generally become exercisable over periods ranging from three to five years. Each option granted expires ten years from the date of the grant. Restricted stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to ordinary shares, subject to certain terms. Restricted stock unit awards are grants that entitle the holder the right to receive an ordinary share, subject to certain terms. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (both time-based vesting and performance-based vesting) generally have restrictions lapsed over a one to four year vesting period. Restrictions generally lapse for non-employee directors after one year. Certain restricted stock units are performance-based awards issued at a target number with the actual number of ordinary shares issued ranging based on achievement of the performance criteria. The Company s equity awards include the acquired awards from the Allergan and Kythera acquisitions ( 2015 Acquired Awards ). 
 Fair Value Assumptions 
 All restricted stock and restricted stock units (whether time-based vesting or performance-based vesting), are granted and expensed, using the fair value per share on the applicable grant date, over the applicable vesting period. Non-qualified options to purchase ordinary shares are granted to employees at exercise prices per share equal to the closing market price per share on the date of grant. The fair value of non-qualified options is determined on the applicable grant dates using the Black-Scholes method of valuation and that amount is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. Using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the fair value of options is based on the following assumptions:  

Share-Based Compensation Expense 
 Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Company s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows ($ in millions):  

Included in the table above is stock-based compensation relating to discontinued operations of $3.2 million and $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 30 

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Company s   results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows ($ in millions):   

Included in the table above is stock-based compensation relating to discontinued operations of $16.0 million and $27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Included in the equity-based compensation awards for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is the impact of accelerations and step-ups relating to the acquisition accounting treatment of outstanding awards acquired in the Allergan and Forest acquisitions as follows ($ in millions): 

Unrecognized future stock-based compensation expense was $554.3 million as of September 30, 2016, including $178.2 million from the Allergan Acquisition and $44.4 million from the Forest Acquisition. This amount will be recognized as an expense over a remaining weighted average period of 1.4 years. Stock-based compensation is being amortized and charged to operations over the same period as the restrictions are eliminated for the participants, which is generally on a straight-line basis. 
 Share Activity 
 The following is a summary of equity award activity for unvested restricted stock and stock units in the period from December 31, 2015 through September 30, 2016:

The following is a summary of equity award activity for non-qualified options to purchase ordinary shares in the period from December 31, 2015 through September 3  0, 2016:  

NOTE 8   Reportable Segments  
 During 2016, Allergan announced a realignment of its businesses to streamline operations. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as four distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International and Anda Distribution. Under the new organizational structure being reported, and the decision to sell our Anda Distribution business, the Company organized its businesses into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs, and the results of corporate initiatives, are managed outside of the three segments.  Prior period results have been recast to align to the current segment presentation. 
 The operating segments are organized as follows: 

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US, including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology, Eye Care, Neurosciences and Urology therapeutic products.     

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women s Health, Anti-Infectives and Established Brands.     

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the US.     

 The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Included in segment revenues are products  sales that are sold through the Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business has sold the product to a third party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are reclassified into revenues from discontinued operations through a reduction of Corporate revenues which eliminates the sales made by our Anda Distribution business from results of continuing operations.  Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third party cost of sales for third party branded products distributed by Anda Distribution. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level: 

Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs.     

General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses located within the United States.     

Total assets including capital expenditures.     

Other select revenues and operating expenses including R D expenses, amortization, IPR D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net, as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.       

 The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis   , Lumigan   /Ganfort   , Alphagan   /Combigan   , Botox   , Fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products.  
 32 

Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs fo  r the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges.  Cost of sales included wi  thin segment contribution does not include non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortizat  ion or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.  
 Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  
 General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.  
 Segment net revenues, segment operating expenses and segment contribution information consisted of the following for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):

NOTE 9   Inventories 
 Inventories consist of finished goods held for sale and distribution, raw materials and work-in-process. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value). The Company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand, market conditions or other factors, which may differ from actual results. 
 Inventories consisted of the following ($ in millions):  

Included in finished goods was $46.1 million related to the fair-value step-up of acquired inventory as of December 31, 2015.

NOTE 10   Investments   and Other Assets  
 Investments in marketable securities, including those classified in cash and cash equivalents due to the maturity term of the instrument, other investments and other assets consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

Investments in securities as of September 30, 2016 included the following: 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair values determined based on Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined based on Level 2 inputs utilize observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and observable quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not very active. Fair values determined based on Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable inputs and include valuations of assets or liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity. A financial asset or liability s classification within the above hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
 Marketable securities and investments consist of available-for-sale investments in U.S. treasury and agency securities and publicly traded equity securities for which market prices are readily available. Unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities and investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) / income.  Realized gains or losses on marketable securities and investments are recorded in interest income.  The Company s marketable securities and other long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices using the specific identification method. These investments are classified as either current or non-current, as appropriate, in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and maturity management.  
   The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to  
 41 

any one issuer. The policy requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.   

NOTE 11   Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following ($ in millions):  

NOTE 12   Goodwill, Product Rights and Other Intangible Assets 
 During 2016, there was a strategic shift in the business to streamline our operations. Under the new organizational structure being reported, the Company organized its business into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. The Company recast goodwill by segment as a result of this change. 
 The Company s goodwill by segment consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the gross balance of goodwill, pre-impairments, was $46,643.1 million and $46,482.5 million, respectively.  Goodwill in discontinued operations was $86.3 million and $6,096.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 The following items had a significant impact on goodwill in the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

An increase in goodwill of $54.2 million resulting from the ForSight Acquisition.     

 42 

Product rights and other intangible assets consisted of the following ($ in millions):   

The following items had a significant impact on net product rights and other intangibles in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The Company acquired $158.0 million in IPR D assets in connection with the ForSight Acquisition;     

The Company recognized approximately $42.0 million in IPR D impairments on a gastroenterology project based on the lack of future availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients;     

 The following items had a significant impact on net product rights and other intangibles in the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The Company recognized approximately $190.0 million in IPR D impairments due to the termination of an osteoarthritis R D project due to clinical results;       

The Company impaired IPR D assets relating to an international eye care pipeline project of $35.0 million based on a decrease in projected cash flows due to market conditions;     

The Company impaired IPR D assets relating to a specified indication of a Botox    therapeutic product of $20.0 million based on a decrease in projected cash flows due to a decline in market demand assumptions;      

The Company recognized $24.0 million in IPR D impairments due to the termination of a women s healthcare R D project due to clinical results; and     

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reclassified certain intangible assets from IPR D to CMP primarily related to Aczone   , Juvederm   , Dalvance    and Botox   .     

 43 

Assuming no additions, disposals or adjustments are made to the carrying values and/or useful lives of the intangible assets, annual amortization expense on product rights and other related intangibles as of September 30, 2016 over the remainder of 2016 an  d each of the next five years is estimated to be as follows ($ in millions):   

The above amortization expense is an estimate. Actual amounts may change from such estimated amounts due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, additional intangible asset acquisitions, finalization of preliminary fair value estimates, potential impairments, accelerated amortization or other events. 

44 

NOTE 13   Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases  
 Total debt and capital leases consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

Fair market value in the table above is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ) under Level 2 based upon quoted prices for similar items in active markets. The book value of the outstanding term loan indebtedness approximates fair value as the debt is at variable interest rates and re-prices frequently. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, the remaining loan balances after the quarterly required payments are due upon maturity. 
 45

 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following ($ in millions):  

NOTE 15   Income Taxes  
 The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 48.0% compared to 40.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was impacted by income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate and U.S. losses tax benefited at rates greater than the Irish statutory rate. Additionally, the tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included, but is not limited to, the following items: an expense of $179.5 million primarily related to a change in a valuation allowance on a portion of U.S. capital loss carryforwards resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the global generics business, a benefit of $48.2 million related to the change in tax rates applicable to certain temporary differences, a benefit of $40.3 million for the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and a benefit of $37.9 million for the New Jersey Grow income tax credit. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was impacted by income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate and U.S. losses tax benefited at rates greater than the Irish statutory rate. Additionally, the tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included, but is not limited to, the following items: a benefit of $318.9 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance on a portion of U.S. capital loss carryforwards resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the generics business, a benefit of $36.8 million for the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, a benefit of $41.3 million for certain IPR D impairments and a benefit of $44.0 million for acquired tax attributes.  
 The increase in the effective tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily the result of a decrease in acquisition related expenses benefited at lower tax rates.  
 During the third quarter, the United States Department of the Treasury issued final and temporary regulations under Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code which are applicable to the federal income tax treatment of certain related party debt. The Company does not expect the regulations to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
 During the period ended September 30, 2016 the Company s non-current deferred tax liability increased by $4,842.7 million primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax assets related to investments in certain U.S. subsidiaries of $5,273.9 million partially offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities of $673.9 million related to investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.  Refer to  NOTE 5   Discontinued Operations  for further discussion and additional disclosures related to our income tax provision reported as part of discontinued operations. 
 The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, it files U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are in accordance with the accounting standard, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations with tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.

The Company has several concurrent audits still pending with the IRS as set forth below:

 A summary of the changes in shareholders  equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the following ($ in millions):    

Share Repurchase Program 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a $10.0 billion share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has repurchased/accrued for $3,089.9 million of ordinary shares. The Company completed the initial $5.0 billion share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income / (Loss) 
 For most of the Company s international operations, the local currency has been determined to be the functional currency. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Equity is translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the equity transaction. Translation adjustments are reflected in shareholders  equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive income / (loss). The effects of converting non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded as transaction gains/losses in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

NOTE 17   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 The Company s revenue, earnings, cash flows and fair value of its assets and liabilities can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange risks and interest rates, as applicable. The Company manages the impact of foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency derivatives. 
 Foreign Currency Derivatives 
 Overall, the Company is a net recipient of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company s consolidated revenues and favorably impact operating expenses in U.S. dollars. 
   The Company enters into foreign currency derivatives to reduce current and future earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating  
 51 

expenses. The Company enters into foreign currency derivativ  es in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures. The Company does not designate the current derivative instruments as accounting hedges.  
 The Company uses foreign currency derivatives, which provide for the sale or purchase or the option to sell or purchase foreign currencies to economically hedge the currency exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions that arise in the normal course of the Company s business. Probable but not firmly committed transactions are comprised primarily of sales of products and purchases of raw materials in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The foreign currency derivatives are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures. 
 The Company recognized realized and unrealized gains on such contracts of $9.1 million and $5.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company recognized realized and unrealized losses on such contracts of $6.4 million and $5.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
 The fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives are recorded in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  or  Investments and other assets  or  Accounts payable and accrued expenses.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, foreign currency derivative assets associated with the foreign exchange option contracts of $23.2 million and $25.0 million, respectively, were included in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, foreign currency derivative assets associated with the foreign exchange option contracts of $28.8 million and $48.5 million, respectively, were included in  Investments and other assets.  At December 31, 2015, there were $0.3 million in foreign currency derivative liabilities associated with the foreign exchange forward contracts included in  Accounts payable and accrued expenses.  

NOTE 18   Fair Value Measurement 
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair values determined based on Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined based on Level 2 inputs utilize observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and observable quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not very active. Fair values determined based on Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable inputs and include valuations of assets or liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity. A financial asset or liability s classification within the above hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

52 

Foreign Currency Contracts 
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notional principal and fair value of the Company s outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were as follows ($ in millions, except average contract rate or strike amount):  

The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and do not represent the amount of the Company s exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 
 Contingent Consideration Obligations 
 The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration obligations is determined using Level 3 inputs and is based on a probability-weighted income approach. The measurement is based upon unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity based on our own assumptions. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, including accretion, are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as follows ($ in millions):  

53 

The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the following activity in contingent consideration obligations was incurred ($ in millions):

NOTE 19   Business Restructuring Charges   
 During 2016, activity related to our business restructuring and facility rationalization activities primarily related to the cost optimization initiatives in conjunction with the Allergan Acquisition. Restructuring activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows ($ in millions): 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $37.7 million and $42.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $72.0 million and $674.8 million, respectively.   

NOTE  20    Commitments   Contingencies 
 The Company and its affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquires, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company s general practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal matters, and to accrue for liabilities when losses are probable and reasonably estimable. 
 The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s consolidated balance sheet includes accrued loss contingencies of approximately $115.0 million, which includes approximately $22.0 million which was assumed by Teva as part of the closing of the sale of the Anda Distribution business on October 3, 2016. 
 The Company s legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to mass tort actions and class actions with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, qui tam actions, antitrust, product liability, breach of contract, securities, patent infringement and trade practices), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss. In those proceedings in which plaintiffs do request publicly quantified amounts of relief, the Company does not believe that the quantified amounts are meaningful because they are merely stated jurisdictional limits, exaggerated and/or unsupported by the evidence or applicable burdens of proof. 
 As noted above, on October 3, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva.  At closing Teva assumed certain liabilities and claims of the Company described below under  Teva Assumed Liabilities.   
 Antitrust Litigation 
   Asacol      Litigation.  On June 22, 2015, two class action complaints were filed in federal court in Massachusetts on behalf of a putative class of indirect purchasers. In each complaint plaintiffs allege that they paid higher prices for Warner Chilcott s Asacol        HD and Delzicol        products as a result of Warner Chilcott s alleged actions preventing or delaying generic competition in the market for Warner Chilcott s older Asacol        product in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and/or state laws. Plaintiffs seek unspecified injunctive relief, treble damages and/or attorneys  fees. All of the actions were consolidated in the federal district court. On September 21, 2015, three additional complaints were filed on behalf of putative classes of indirect purchasers, each raising similar   
 55 

allegations to the complaints filed in June 2015. Defendants have moved to dismiss the indirect purchasers  complaint. A hearing was held   on the motion to dismiss on May   11, 2016.  On July 20, 2016, the court issued a decision granting   the motion in part, dismissing the indirect purchaser plaintiffs  claims based on purported reverse payments and dismissed several of indirect purchaser plaintiffs  claims based on state laws. On August 15, 2016,the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed a se  cond amended complaint .  The Company filed an answer to the second amended complaint on October 4, 2016.  A complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class of direct purchasers of Asacol        in federal court   in New York on April 26, 2016.    The direct purch  aser complaint makes similar allegations to the complaints filed by the indirect purchaser plaintiffs.  On May 25, 2016, defendants filed a motion to transfer the direct purchaser action to the federal court in Massachusetts where it could be consolidated   with the indirect purchaser cases.   Two additional direct purchaser putative class action complaints were filed in federal court in New York on June 29, 2016.  On September 7, 2016, direct purchaser plaintiffs agreed to transfer the cases filed in New Yor  k to the federal court in Massachusetts where they were consolidated.  On October 11, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the direct purchasers  consolidated complaint.  The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to de  fend itself vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Botox      Litigation . On February 24, 2015, a class action complaint was filed in federal court in California. The complaint alleges unlawful market allocation in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, agreement in restraint of trade in violation of 15 U.S.C.  1 of the Sherman Act, unlawful maintenance of monopoly market power in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  2 of the Sherman Act, violations of California s Cartwright Act, Section 16700 et seq. of Calif. Bus. and Prof. Code., and violations of California s unfair competition law, Section 17200 et seq. of Calif. Bus. and Prof. Code. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 29, 2015. On June 29, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 20, 2015, the Court denied the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 18, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment or adjudication. The Company filed a response to the motion for judgment on the pleadings on February 11, 2016. The court held oral argument on plaintiff s motion on March 4, 2016 and took the matter under submission. On May 31, 2016, the court denied plaintiffs  motion for partial judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment or adjudication.  On June 14, 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s denial of the motion.  On July 19, 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.  On October 14, 2016, the Company filed an opposition to plaintiffs  motion for class certification.  The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   
 Doryx      Litigation . In July 2012, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Mylan ) filed a complaint against Warner Chilcott and Mayne Pharma International Pty. Ltd. ( Mayne ) in federal court in Pennsylvania alleging that Warner Chilcott and Mayne prevented or delayed Mylan s generic competition to Warner Chilcott s Doryx        products in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with Mylan s prospective economic relationships under Pennsylvania state law. In the complaint, Mylan seeks unspecified treble and punitive damages and attorneys  fees. Following the filing of Mylan s complaint, three putative class actions were filed against Warner Chilcott and Mayne by purported direct purchasers, and one putative class action was filed by purported indirect purchasers. In addition, four retailers filed in the same court a civil antitrust complaint in their individual capacities.  In each of the class and individual cases the plaintiffs allege that they paid higher prices for Warner Chilcott s Doryx        products as a result of Warner Chilcott s and Mayne s alleged actions preventing or delaying generic competition in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws and/or state laws. Plaintiffs seek unspecified injunctive relief, treble damages and/or attorneys  fees. All of the actions were consolidated in the federal district court.  
 Warner Chilcott and Mayne s motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice by the court in June 2013. Thereafter, Warner Chilcott and Mayne reached agreements to settle the claims of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff class representatives, the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff class representatives and each of the individual retailer plaintiffs. Warner Chilcott and Mylan filed motions for summary judgment on March 10, 2014. On April 16, 2015, the court issued an order granting Warner Chilcott and Mayne s motion for summary judgment, denying Mylan s summary judgment motion and entering judgment in favor of Warner Chilcott and Mayne on all counts. Mylan  appealed the district court s decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  On September 28, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision and affirmed the ruling of the district court.  On October 12, 2016 Mylan petitioned the Third Circuit for a rehearing en banc. 
 The Company intends to vigorously defend its rights in the litigations. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation and whether any additional similar suits will be filed. 
               Loestrin      24 Litigation.  On April 5, 2013, two putative class   were filed in the federal district court against Warner Chilcott   and certain affiliates alleging that Warner Chilcott   s 2009 patent lawsuit settlements wi  th Watson Laboratories and Lupin related to Loestrin        24 Fe (norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets,  Loestrin          24 ) were unlawful. The complaints, both asserted on behalf of putative classes of end-payors, generally a  llege that Watson and Lupin improperly delayed   
 56 

launching generic versions of Loestrin        24 in exchange for substantial payments from Warner Chilcott in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws  . The complaints each seek declarato  ry and injunctive relief and damages. Additional complaints have been filed by different plaintiffs seeking to represent the same putative class of end-payors. In addition to the end-payor suits, two lawsuits have been filed on behalf of a class of direct   payors.      After a hearing on September 26, 2013, the JPML issued an order transferring all related Loestrin        24 cases to the federal court for the District of Rhode Island. On September 4, 2014, the court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss the compla  int. The plaintiffs appealed the district court s decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and oral argument was held on December 7, 2015. On February 22, 2016 the First Circuit issued its decision vacating the decision of, and remanding the matter t  o, the district court.  On June 11, 2016, defendants filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the claims of the direct purchaser class plaintiffs, end-payor class plaintiffs and individual direct purchaser plaintiffs.  
 Namenda      Litigation . On September 15, 2014, the State of New York, through the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Forest was acting to prevent or delay generic competition to Forest s immediate-release product Namenda        in violation of federal and New York antitrust laws and committed other fraudulent acts in connection with its commercial plans for Namenda        XR. In the complaint, the state seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 24, 2014, the state filed a motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Forest from discontinuing or otherwise limiting the availability of immediate-release Namenda        until the conclusion of the litigation. A hearing was held in November 2014 on the state s preliminary injunction motion. On December 11, 2014, the district court issued a ruling granting the state s injunction motion and issued an injunction on December 15, 2014. On May 22, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction. On June 5, 2015, Forest filed a petition with the Second Circuit for rehearing en banc which was denied. Forest and the New York Attorney General reached a settlement on November 24, 2015. On May 29, 2015, a putative class action was filed on behalf of a class of direct purchasers and on June 8, 2015 a similar putative class action was filed on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers. Since that time, additional complaints have been filed on behalf of putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers. The class action complaints make claims similar to those asserted by the New York Attorney General and also include claims that Namenda        patent litigation settlements between Forest and generic companies also violated the antitrust laws. On December 22, 2015, Forest and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss the pending complaints of the putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers. On September 13, 2016, the court issued a decision denying the Company s motion to dismiss.  On September 27, 2016 the Company filed an answer to the amended complaint. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend both its brand and generic defendant entities vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Zymar     /Zymaxid      Litigation . On February 16, 2012, Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. filed a complaint in the federal district court in Delaware against Senju Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. ( Senju ), Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ( Kyorin ), and Allergan, Inc. ( Allergan ) alleging monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, conspiracy to monopolize, and unreasonable restraint of trade in the market for gatifloxacin ophthalmic formulations, which includes Allergan s ZYMAR        gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% and ZYMAXID        gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% products. On May 24, 2012, Allergan filed a motion to dismiss the complaint to the extent it seeks to impose liability for alleged injuries occurring prior to August 19, 2011, which is the date Apotex obtained final approval of its proposed generic product. Allergan and the other defendants also moved to dismiss. Defendants also filed a motion to stay the action pending resolution of related patent actions in the federal court in Delaware and in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On February 7, 2013, the court granted defendants  motion to stay the proceedings pending resolution of the appeal in the patent dispute and denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice to renew. On September 18, 2014, defendants filed a new motion to dismiss the Apotex plaintiffs  complaint. The court dismissed Allergan s motion on May 2, 2015. Thereafter, Allergan filed an answer to Apotex s complaint on June 1, 2015. On June 6, 2014, a separate antitrust class action complaint was filed in the federal district court in Delaware against the same defendants as in the Apotex case. The complaint alleges that defendants unlawfully excluded or delayed generic competition in the gatifloxacin ophthalmic formulations market (generic versions of ZYMAR        and ZYMAXID       ). On September 18, 2014, Allergan filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and joined in co-defendants  motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On August 19, 2015, the court granted Allergan s motion to dismiss. On September 18, 2015, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit oral argument was held on June 13, 2016.  On September 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the District Court s granting of Allergan s motion to dismiss and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.  The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Commercial Litigation 
   Celexa     /Lexapro      Class Actions . Forest and certain of its affiliates were named as defendants in three federal court actions filed on behalf of individuals who purchased Celexa        and/or Lexapro        for pediatric use, all of which have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in an MDL proceeding in the federal district court Massachusetts (the  Celexa       /Lexapro        MDL ). These actions, two of   
 57 

which were originally filed as putative nationwide class actions, and one of which is a putative California-wide class action, allege that Forest marketed Celexa        and/or Lexapro        for off-label pediatric use an  d paid illegal kickbacks to physicians to induce prescriptions of Celexa        and Lexapro       . The complaints assert various similar claims, including claims under the state consumer protection statutes and state common laws. Plaintiffs in the various actions sou  ght to have certified California, Missouri, Illinois and New York state-wide classes. However, only the Missouri state class was certified. Forest subsequently reached an agreement with the MDL plaintiffs to settle the Missouri class claims, including clai  ms by both individuals and third party payors that purchased Celexa        or Lexapro        for use by a minor from 1998 to December 31, 2013, for $7.65 million with a potential to increase the amount to $10.35 million if settling plaintiffs meet certain thresholds.   On September 8, 2014 the court granted final approval for the settlement.  
 Additional actions relating to the promotion of Celexa      and/or Lexapro      have been filed all of which have been consolidated in the Celexa     /Lexapro      MDL. On May 3, 2013, an action was filed in federal court in California on behalf of individuals who purchased Lexapro      for adolescent use, seeking to certify a state-wide class action in California and alleging that our promotion of Lexapro      for adolescent depression has been deceptive. On March 5, 2014 the court granted Forest s motion to dismiss this complaint. Plaintiff then appealed the district court s decision to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and on February 20, 2015, the First Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, ruling that Plaintiffs  California state law claims were preempted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). On November 13, 2013, an action was filed in federal court in Minnesota seeking to certify a nationwide class of third-party payor entities that purchased Celexa      and Lexapro      for pediatric use. The complaint asserts claims under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, alleging that Forest engaged in an off-label marketing scheme and paid illegal kickbacks to physicians to induce prescriptions of Celexa      and Lexapro     . Forest moved to dismiss the complaint and on December 12, 2014, the court issued a ruling dismissing plaintiff s claims under Minnesota s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, but denying the remaining portions of the motion. A motion for class certification was filed in February, 2016, and denied on June 2, 2016.  Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a 23(f) petition with the First Circuit requesting leave to appeal the denial of class certification.  The district court judge entered an Order dated August 8, 2016, staying discovery in the case until the First Circuit renders a decision on plaintiffs  23(f) petition. On March 13, 2014, an action was filed in the federal court in Massachusetts by two third-party payors seeking to certify a nationwide class of persons and entities that purchased Celexa      and Lexapro      for use by pediatric use. The complaint asserts claims under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, state consumer protection statutes, and state common laws, alleging that Forest engaged in an off-label marketing scheme and paid illegal kickbacks to physicians to induce prescriptions of Celexa      and Lexapro     . The court granted Forest s motion to dismiss this complaint in its December 12, 2014 ruling. On August 28, 2014, an action was filed in the federal district court in Washington seeking to certify a nationwide class of consumers and subclasses of Washington and Massachusetts consumers that purchased Celexa      and Lexapro      for pediatric use. The complaint asserts claims under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, alleging that Forest engaged in off-label marketing scheme and paid illegal kickbacks to physicians to induce prescriptions of Celexa      and Lexapro     . Forest s response to the complaint was filed on December 19, 2014. On June 16, 2015, the court issued a ruling on the motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part. Plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint. Forest moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  On June 9, 2016, the court denied Forest s motion. 
 Forest and certain of its affiliates were also named as defendants in two actions filed on behalf of entities or individuals who purchased or reimbursed certain purchases of Celexa      and Lexapro      for pediatric use pending in the Missouri state court. These claims arise from similar allegations as those contained in the federal actions described in the preceding paragraphs. One action, filed on November 6, 2009, was brought by two entities that purchased or reimbursed certain purchases of Celexa      and/or Lexapro     . The complaint asserts claims under the Missouri consumer protection statute and Missouri common law, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys  fees. The other action, filed on July 22, 2009, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of a class of Missouri citizens who purchased Celexa      for pediatric use. The complaint asserts claims under the Missouri consumer protection statute and Missouri common law, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys  fees. In October 2010, the court certified a class of Missouri domiciliary citizens who purchased Celexa      for pediatric use at any time prior to the date of the class certification order, but who do not have a claim for personal injury. The Company reached agreements with both sets of plaintiffs in the Missouri actions to resolve each matter for payments that are not material to our financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against these actions. At this time, the Company does not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
   Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation.   In October 2012, Forest and certain of its affiliates were named as defendants, in a putative class action in federal court in Missouri. This suit alleges that Forest and another defendant violated the TCPA and was filed on behalf of a proposed class that includes all persons who, from four years prior to the filing of the action, were sent telephone facsimile messages of material advertising the commercial availability of any property, goods, or services by or on behalf of defendants, which did not display an opt-out notice compliant with a certain regulation promulgated by the FCC. On July 17, 2013, the district court granted Forest s motion to stay the action pending the administrative proceeding initiated by the pending FCC Petition and a separate petition Forest filed. On October 31, 2015, another class action complaint was filed in Missouri state court against Allergan USA, Inc., Warner Chilcott Corporation and Actavis, Inc. alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection   
 58 

Act, the Missouri Consumer Fraud and Protection A  ct and conversion on behalf of a putative nationwide class of plaintiffs to who defendant Warner Chilcott Corporation sent unsolicited facsimile advertisements. Defendants removed this action to the federal district court for the Western District of Missou  ri on December 10, 2015 and responded to the complaint on February 8, 2016. On February 17, 2016, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed defendants Allergan USA, Inc. and Actavis, Inc. from the litigation.  
 In a related matter, on June 27, 2013, Forest filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the FCC requesting that the FCC find that (1) the faxes at issue in the action complied, or substantially complied with the FCC regulation, and thus did not violate it, or (2) the FCC regulation was not properly promulgated under the TCPA. On January 31, 2014, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on Forest s and several other similar petitions. On October 30, 2014, the FCC issued a final order on the FCC Petition granting Forest and several other petitioners a retroactive waiver of the opt-out notice requirement for all faxes sent with express consent. The litigation plaintiffs, who had filed comments on the January 2014 Public Notice, have appealed the final order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Forest and other petitioners have moved to intervene in the appeal seeking review of that portion of the FCC final order addressing the statutory basis for the opt out/express consent portion of the regulation.  Warner Chilcott has filed a similar petition with the FCC. 
 Forest and Warner Chilcott believe they have substantial meritorious defenses to the putative class actions brought under the TCPA, and intend to defend the actions vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Prescription Drug Abuse Litigation . On May 21, 2014, the California counties Santa Clara and Orange filed a lawsuit in California state court on behalf of the State of California against several pharmaceutical manufacturers. Plaintiffs named Actavis plc in the suit. The California plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 9, 2014. On June 2, 2014, the City of Chicago also filed a complaint in Illinois state court against the same set of defendants, including Actavis plc, that were sued in the California Action. Co-defendants in the action removed the matter to the federal court in Illinois. Both the California and Chicago complaints allege that the manufacturer defendants engaged in a deceptive campaign to promote their products in violation of state and local laws. Each of the complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, penalties and injunctive relief. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in each action. On May 8, 2015, the court in the Chicago litigation granted the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 26, 2015, the City of Chicago filed a second amended complaint. On September 29, 2016, the court in the Chicago litigation granted in part and denied in part defendants  motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.  In the California action, on August 27, 2015, the court stayed the action based on primary jurisdiction arguments raised in the motions to dismiss. On June 3, 2016, the California plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  On July 1, 2016, the Company and codefendants filed joint oppositions to the California plaintiffs  motion to lift the stay and motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  On July 27, 2016, the court ordered the California plaintiffs to file another motion for leave to file an amended complaint along with a proposed amended complaint.  On October 19, 2016, the court in the California litigation lifted the stay in part permitting defendants to challenge the third amended complaint and for the parties to discuss settlement and maintaining the stay in all other respects.  On December 15, 2015, the State of Mississippi filed a lawsuit in Mississippi state court against several pharmaceutical manufacturers.  The Mississippi action parallels the allegations in the California and Chicago matters and seeks monetary and equitable relief.  In March and April 2016, the defendants filed motions to dismiss, stay, and transfer venue in the Mississippi action.  The Company anticipates that additional suits will be filed. The Company believes it has several meritorious defenses to the claims alleged. However, an adverse determination in these actions could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
   Testosterone Replacement Therapy Class Action . On November 24, 2014, the Company was served with a putative class action complaint filed on behalf a class of third party payers in federal court in Illinois. The suit alleges that the Company and other named pharmaceutical defendants violated various laws including the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and state consumer protection laws in connection with the sale and marketing of certain testosterone replacement therapy pharmaceutical products ( TRT Products ), including the Company s Androderm        product. This matter was filed in the TRT Products Liability MDL, described in more detail below, notwithstanding that it is not a product liability matter. Plaintiff alleges that it reimbursed third parties for dispensing TRT Products to beneficiaries of its insurance policies. Plaintiff seeks to obtain certain equitable relief, including injunctive relief and an order requiring restitution and/or disgorgement, and to recover damages and multiple damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the complaint, after which plaintiff amended its complaint. Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part on February 3, 2016. The Court dismissed plaintiff s substantive RICO claims for mail and wire fraud for failure to plead with particularity under Rule 9(b) but granted plaintiffs leave to replead. The court also dismissed plaintiff s state law statutory claims and common law claims for fraud and unjust enrichment. The Court declined to dismiss plaintiff s conspiracy claims pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   1962(d) and its claims for negligent misrepresentation. On March 2, 2016, the defendants jointly filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the court s ruling on plaintiff s claims under 18 U.S.C.   1962(d). Plaintiff filed its Third Amended Complaint on April 7, 2016.  Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint on May 5, 2016, plaintiffs filed opposition to same on June 20, 2016 and defendants jointly filed a reply on July 7, 2016.  On August 2, 2016, the Court dismissed all claims in the Third Amended Complaint against the   
 59 

Company except Count XXIV alleging conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.   1962(d).  O  n August 29, 2016, the Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration or, in the Alternative, Motion to Certify for Interlocutory Appeal, which the Court denied on the September 8, 2016.  Discovery is in the early stages.  The Company believes it has substanti  al meritorious defenses to the claims alleged and intends to vigorously defend the action. However, an adverse determination in the case could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 TNS Products Litigation . On March 19, 2014, a complaint was filed in the federal district court in California. The complaint alleges violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and the False Advertising Law, and deceit. On June 2, 2014, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. On June 23, 2014, Allergan filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. On September 5, 2014, the court granted-in-part and denied-in-part Allergan s motion to dismiss. On September 8, 2014, the court set trial for September 1, 2015. On November 4, 2014, Allergan and SkinMedica filed a motion to dismiss. On January 7, 2015, Allergan and SkinMedica s motion to dismiss was denied. On January 15, 2015, the court set a trial date of February 16, 2016. On February 19, 2015 Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. On May 27, 2015, the case was stayed pending the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in another matter involving similar legal issues. The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. However, these actions, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
   Xaleron Dispute.  On February 5, 2016, Xaleron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Allergan, Inc. and Actavis, Inc. in state court in New York. The complaint, filed on February 26, 2016, alleges Allergan misappropriated Xaleron s confidential business information and asserts claims for unfair competition, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and unjust enrichment. The company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on April 15, 2016.  On September 13, 2016 the cou  rt issued a decision denying the Company s motion.  The Company filed an answer to the complaint and the parties are now engaged in discovery.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against this action. However, this action, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Employment Litigation 
 In July 2012, Forest and certain of its affiliates were named as defendants in an action brought by certain former company sales representatives and specialty sales representatives in the federal district court in New York. The action is a putative class and collective action, and alleges class claims under Title VII for gender discrimination with respect to pay and promotions, as well as discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, and a collective action claim under the Equal Pay Act. The proposed Title VII gender class includes all current and former female sales representatives employed by the Company throughout the U.S. from 2008 to the date of judgment, and the proposed Title VII pregnancy sub-class includes all current and former female sales representatives who have been, are, or will become pregnant while employed by the Company throughout the U.S. from 2008 to the date of judgment. The proposed Equal Pay Act collective action class includes current, former, and future female sales representatives who were not compensated equally to similarly-situated male employees during the applicable liability period. The Second Amended Complaint also includes non-class claims on behalf of certain of the named Plaintiffs for sexual harassment and retaliation under Title VII, and for violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act. On August 14, 2014, the court issued a decision on the Company s motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part, striking the plaintiffs  proposed class definition and instead limiting the proposed class to a smaller set of potential class members and dismissing certain of the individual plaintiffs  claims. Plaintiffs filed a motion for conditional certification of an Equal Pay Act collective action on May 22, 2015 which the Company has opposed. On September 2, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs motion to conditionally certify a collective action. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against this action. At this time, the Company does not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
 Patent Litigation 
 Patent Enforcement Matters 
   Amrix      . In August 2014, Aptalis Pharmatech, Inc. ( Aptalis ) and Ivax International GmbH ( Ivax ), Aptalis s licensee for Amrix, brought an action for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,790,199 (the   199 patent ), and 7,829,121 (the   121 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively  Apotex ). Apotex has notified Aptalis that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market a generic version of Amrix before these patents expire. (The  199 and  121 patents expire in November 2023.) This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of Apotex s ANDA until no earlier than December 27, 2016 (unless there is a final court decision adverse to Forest sooner, and subject to any other exclusivities, such as a first filer 180 day market exclusivity). A bench trial concluded on November 17, 2015. Post-trial briefing concluded on April 8, 2016. On September 29, 2016, Adare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Ivax filed suit in U.S. District Court for the   
 60 

District of Delaware against Apotex asserting that Apotex s generic product will infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,399,025.  No schedule has been set.  The Company believes   it has meritorious claims to prevent the generic applicant from launching a generic version of Amrix. However, there can be no assurance a generic version will not be launched.   
 Bystolic      IPR . On December 23, 2015, Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited ( Forest ) received a notification letter that an Inter Partes Review of the USPTO ( IPR ) petition was filed by Lower Drug Prices for Consumers, LLC ( LDPC ) regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,545,040, expiring on December 17, 2021 (the   040 Patent ). LDPC filed the IPR petition on December 22, 2015, and refiled a corrected petition on January 20, 2016. Forest filed a Patent Owner s Preliminary Response on April 22, 2016. On July 1, 2016, the USPTO Patent and Trial Appeal Board ( PTAB ) filed their decision denying institution of the IPR.  Thereafter, LDPC filed a Request for Rehearing of the decision denying institution of the IPR.  On October 19, 2016, the PTAB denied the Request for Rehearing.  
 Canasa      . In July 2013, Aptalis Pharma US, Inc. and Aptalis Pharma Canada Inc. brought actions for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,217,083 (the   083 patent ) and 8,436,051 (the   051 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Mylan and Sandoz. These companies have notified Aptalis that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Canasa        before these patents expire. Amended complaints were filed against these companies in November 2013 adding claims for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,854,384 (the   384 patent ). The  083,  051, and  384 patents expire in June 2028. On November 11, 2015, Aptalis entered into a settlement agreement with Mylan. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mylan may launch its generic version of Canasa        on December 15, 2018, or earlier under certain circumstances. On March 22, 2016, Aptalis entered into a settlement agreement with Sandoz. On December 14, 2015, Aptalis brought an action for infringement of the  083,  051, and  384 patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Pharmaceutical Sourcing Partners, Inc. ( PSP ). PSP had notified Aptalis that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Canasa        before certain of these patents expire. This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of PSP s ANDA that expires no earlier than May 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Aptalis sooner). On December 23 and 27, 2015, Aptalis brought actions for infringement of the  083,  051, and  384 patents in the U.S. District Courts for the District of New Jersey and the District of Delaware, respectively, against Delcor Asset Corp., Renaissance Pharma, Inc. and Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC ( Delcor ).

Under the terms of the settlement agreements, and subject to review of the settlement terms by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Plaintiffs will provide licenses to Anchen and Par that will permit them to launch their generic versions of Namenda XR        as of the date that is the later of (a) two (2) calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the  209 patent, the  708 patent, the  379 patent, the  752 patent, the  085 patent, and the  233 patent, as well as the  009 patent for Par only, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b) the dates that Anchen and Par obtain final FDA approval of their respective ANDAs, or earlier in certain circumstances.

The Company entered into a settlement agreement with Lupin on December 22, 2015. On January 5, 2016, the district court issued a claim construction ruling that included findings of indefiniteness as to certain claim terms in the asserted patents. On February 11, 2016, the Company settled with Apotex. Trial began on February 16, 2016 with the remaining defendant Teva with respect to the  009 patent.

On August 24, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit docketed the appeal filed by the Company. The Company s opening brief is due on December 8, 2016.  The Company believes that its arguments on appeal are substantial and meritorious.  On September 29, 2016, the Company issued a press release following announcement of ANDA approvals, including FDA final approval by Lupin.  If the district court ruling is upheld on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, there is a possibility that generic entry for Namenda XR could occur following an adverse decision. On October 9, 2015, the Company also brought an action for infringement of the  009,  209,  708,  379,  752,  085, and  233 patents in the U.S.

 Rapaflo      . On June 17, 2013, Actavis, Inc., Watson Laboratories, Inc., (collectively,  Actavis ) and Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ( Kissei ) sued Hetero USA Inc., Hetero Labs Limited, and Hetero Labs Limited, Unit 3 (collectively,  Hetero ) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that sales of silodosin tablets, a generic version of Actavis  Rapaflo        tablets, would infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,387,603 (the   603 patent ). On June 17, 2013 Actavis and Kissei sued Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz ) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that sales of Sandoz s generic version of Rapaflo        would infringe the  603 patent. The complaint seeks injunctive relief. On December 22, 2014 the Parties completed a settlement agreement with Hetero. Actavis and Kissei s lawsuit against Sandoz have been consolidated and remain pending. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the generic applicants prior to April 8, 2016. The Company believes it has meritorious claims to prevent the generic applicants from launching a generic version of Rapaflo       . However, if a generic applicant prevails in the pending litigation or launches a generic version of Rapaflo        before the pending litigation is finally resolved, it could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

 On March 1, 2016, Allergan received a Paragraph IV letter from Famy Care Limited ( Famy Care ) notifying Allergan that they have filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Restasis      before the patents expire in August 2024, contending that the  111 patent, the  162 patent, the  556 patent, the  048 patent, the  930 patent, and the  191 patent are invalid and not infringed by their respective proposed generic products. In March 2016, the Court entered an order requesting supplemental briefs on the effect of the Federal Circuit s  Acorda  decision (No. 2014-1456) on Teva s and Mylan s pending motions to dismiss. In their supplemental briefs, Teva acknowledged that, under the  Acorda  decision, it is subject to specific personal jurisdiction in the Eastern District of Texas and that venue is proper, and Mylan requested that the District Court refrain from taking action on its pending motion until after Mylan has sought panel and  en banc  rehearing in the  Acorda  action. In April 2016, the Court issued a memorandum and opinion denying Mylan s and Teva s motions to dismiss. On April 12, 2016, Allergan filed a complaint for infringement of the  111 patent,  162 patent,  556 patent,  048 patent,  930 patent, and the  191 patent in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Famy Care. In March and April 2016, Allergan filed answers to Teva, Akorn and InnoPharma s counterclaims. On June 6, 2016, Famy Care filed an answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. In June 2016, Allergan filed a motion for consolidation and the Court entered an order consolidating the Famy Care matter,  C.A. 2:16-cv-00401-WCB , into  C.A. 2:15-cv-01455-WCB,  (the  Lead  case). 
 On July 20, 2016, Allergan filed a complaint for infringement of the  111 patent,  162 patent,  556 patent,  048 patent,  930 patent, and the  191 patent in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and, on July 21, 2016, a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and TWi Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ( TWi ). TWi notified Allergan that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Restasis      before these certain patents expire. While the Company intends to vigorously defend the patents at issue in this litigation, Allergan can offer no assurance as to whether the lawsuit will be successful and that a generic version will not be launched. 
 Restasis      IPR.  On June 6, 2016, Allergan, Inc. ( Allergan ) received  notification letters that Inter Partes Review of the USPTO ( IPR ) petitions were filed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Mylan ) regarding U.S. Patent Nos. 8,629,111 (the   111 patent ), 8,633,162 (the   162 patent ), 8,642,556 (the   556 patent ), 8,648,048 (the   048 patent ), 8,685,930 (the   930 patent ), and 9,248,191 (the   191 patent ), which patents expire on August 27, 2024. Mylan filed the IPR petition on June 3, 2016. On June 23, 2016, Allergan received a notification letter that a IPR petition and motion for joinder was filed by Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC ( Argentum ) regarding the  111 patent.  
   Saphris      . Between September 2014 and May 2015, Forest Laboratories, LLC, and Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd. (collectively,  Forest ) brought actions for infringement of some or all of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,763,476 (the   476 patent ), 7,741,358 (the   358 patent ) and 8,022,228 (the   228 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. Including a 6-month pediatric extension of regulatory exclusivity, the  476 patent expires in December 2020, and the  358 and  228 patents expire in October 2026. These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs that expires no earlier than February 13, 2017 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest sooner). On February 3, 2015, the District Court consolidated the then-pending actions for all purposes. On September 30, 2015, the District Court consolidated all pending actions. On March 28, 2016, the Court entered Forest and Hikma s proposed joint stipulation and order of adverse judgment and dismissal of claims related to the  358 and  228 patents. In April 2016, the Court granted the proposed consent judgment of non-infringement and order of dismissal of counterclaims related to the  358 and  228 patents, as well as a stipulation and order with respect to infringement of Claims 1, 2, and 6 of the  476 patent, between Plaintiffs and Breckenridge. The Court also granted the proposed stipulation of entry and proposed order of adverse judgment and dismissal of counterclaims related to the  358 and  228 patents between Plaintiffs and Sigmapharm. Trial is scheduled to begin in October 2016   
 65 

wit  h respect to the  476 patent, the only remaining patent-in-suit. In April, May and July 2016, the Court granted the proposed stipulations and orders of infringement of certain claims of the  476 patent as to Hikma, Breckenridge and Alembic. On October 13,   2016, the Court stayed trial as to Sigmapharm and extended the 30-month stay as to Sigmapharm.  Trial started on October 24, 2016.  The Company believes it has meritorious claims to prevent the generic applicants from launching a generic version of Saphris       . However, there can be no assurance a generic version will not be launched.  
 Savella      . Between September 2013 and February 2014, Forest Laboratories, Inc., Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd. (collectively,  Forest ) and Royalty Pharma Collection Trust ( Royalty ), Forest s licensor for Savella       , brought actions for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,602,911 (the   911 patent ), 7,888,342 (the   342 patent ), and 7,994,220 (the   220 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Amneal, Apotex, First Time US Generics, Glenmark, Hetero, Lupin, Mylan, Par, Ranbaxy, and Sandoz, and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. These companies have notified Forest and Royalty that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Savella before these patents expire. (The  342 patent expires in November 2021, the  911 patent expires in January 2023, and the  220 patent expires in September 2029.) These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs until July 14, 2016 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Royalty Pharma sooner). On March 7, 2014, Forest and Royalty voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against Sandoz. On March 20, 2014, the district court consolidated all of the remaining pending actions for all purposes and issued a scheduling order setting a trial date in January 2016. On May 12, 2014, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with First Time US Generics. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, and subject to review of the settlement terms by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Forest will provide a license to First Time that will permit it to launch its generic version of Savella        as of the date that is the later of (a) six (6) -calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the  911 patent, the  342 patent, and the  220 patent, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b) the date that First Time obtains final FDA approval of its ANDA, or earlier in certain circumstances. On December 15, 2014, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Ranbaxy. On April 8, 2015, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. On or about April 29, 2015, Forest entered into a settlement agreement with Par that will permit Par to launch its generic version of Savella        as of the date that is the later of (a) six (6) calendar months prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the  911 patent, the  342 patent, and the  220 patent, including any extensions and/or pediatric exclusivities; or (b) the date that Par obtains final FDA approval of its ANDA, or earlier in certain circumstances. On December 11, 2015, Forest and Royalty entered into settlement agreements with Hetero and Glenmark. On January 8, 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Amneal. On January 19, 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex. The defendants under these agreements may enter the market as of March 19, 2026. A bench trial concluded on January 26, 2016. Post-trial briefing concluded on April 26, 2016. In June 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Lupin. On July 11, 2016, the Court entered an order, opinion and judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Mylan, that Mylan infringes the asserted claims of the  911,  342 and  220 patents, and that the asserted claims of the  911,  342 and  220 patents are valid.  On August 9, 2016, Mylan filed a notice of appeal.  On September 30, 2016, Forest and Royalty entered into a settlement agreement with Mylan, and the appeal was dismissed.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Mylan may enter the market as of March 19, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances.  
 Teflaro      . In January 2015, Forest Laboratories, LLC, Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd., and Cerexa, Inc. (collectively,  Forest ) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ( Takeda ), Forest s licensor for Teflaro       , brought an action for infringement of some or all of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,417,175 (the   175 patent ), 6,906,055 (the   055 patent ), 7,419,973 (the   973 patent ) and 8,247,400 (the   400 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex and Sandoz, and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. These companies have notified Forest and Takeda that they have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Teflaro        before some or all of the  175,  055,  973 and  400 patents expire. (The  175 patent expires in April 2022, the  055 and  973 patents expire in December 2021, and the  400 patent expires in February 2031.) These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs until April 29, 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Takeda sooner). On June 24, 2015, the District Court issued a scheduling order setting a trial date in June 2017.   
 In April 2016, Forest filed a complaint for infringement of the  175 patent in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Apotex. Apotex had notified Forest and Takeda that they have filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Teflaro      before the  175 patent expires in April 2022. This lawsuit triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDA with respect to the  175 patent until September 8, 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Takeda sooner). In May 2016, Apotex filed an answer and counterclaim as to the  175 patent and Forest filed an answer to Apotex s counterclaims. On June 14, 2016, Allergan filed a motion for consolidation and the Court entered an order consolidating  C.A. 1:16-cv-00269-GMS , into  C.A. 1:15-cv-00018-GMS,  (the  Lead  case). On July 27, 2016, Forest and Takeda dismissed the  055 and  973 patents with respect to Sandoz.  On August 5, 2016, Forest and Takeda dismissed the  175 patent as to Sandoz, leaving the  400 patent as the only patent asserted against Sandoz.  The  175 patent and the  400 patent are still asserted against Apotex.  While the company intends to vigorously defend the patents at issue in this litigation, Forest can offer no assurance as to whether the lawsuit will be successful and that a generic version will not be launched.

Viibryd       .   In March 2015, Forest Laboratories, LLC, Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd., (collectively,  Forest ) and Merck KGaA and Merck Patent Gesellschaft Mit Beschr nkter Haftung (collectively,  Merck ), Forest s licensor for Viibryd, brought actions for infring  ement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,834,020 (the   020 patent ), 8,193,195 (the   195 patent ), 8,236,804 (the   804 patent ) and 8,673,921 (the   921 patent ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Accord Healthcare Inc. ( Accord ), Alemb  ic Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. ( Alembic ), Apotex, Inc. ( Apotex ), InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( InvaGen ), and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ( Teva ), and related subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. These companies have notified Forest and/or Merck that t  hey have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking to obtain approval to market generic versions of Viibryd before the  020,  195,  804 and  921 patents expire in June 2022. These lawsuits triggered an automatic stay of approval of the applicable ANDAs until July 2  1, 2018 (unless a court issues a decision adverse to Forest and Merck sooner). On August 24, 2015, the District Court consolidated the actions for all purposes and issued a scheduling order setting a trial date in January 2018. On November 23, 2015, Forest   and Merck brought an action for infringement of the  020,  195,  804 and  921 patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against InvaGen, which matter was consolidated with the earlier-filed action against InvaGen. While the Company i  ntends to vigorously defend the patents at issue in this litigation, Forest can offer no assurance as to whether the lawsuit will be successful and that a generic version will not be launched.  
 Product Liability Litigation 
 Actonel      Litigation . Warner Chilcott is a defendant in approximately 171 cases and a potential defendant with respect to approximately 374  unfiled claims involving a total of approximately 554 plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs relating to Warner Chilcott s bisphosphonate prescription drug Actonel       . The claimants allege, among other things, that Actonel        caused them to suffer osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ), a rare but serious condition that involves severe loss or destruction of the jawbone, and/or atypical fractures of the femur ( AFF ). All of the cases have been filed in either federal or state courts in the United States. Warner Chilcott is in the initial stages of discovery in these litigations. In addition, Warner Chilcott is aware of four purported product liability class actions that were brought against Warner Chilcott in provincial courts in Canada alleging, among other things, that Actonel        caused the plaintiffs and the proposed class members who ingested Actonel        to suffer atypical fractures or other side effects. It is expected that these plaintiffs will seek class certification. Plaintiffs have typically asked for unspecified monetary and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys  fees. Warner Chilcott is indemnified by Sanofi for certain Actonel claims pursuant to a collaboration agreement relating to the two parties  co-promotion of the product in the United States and other countries. In addition, Warner Chilcott is also partially indemnified by the Procter   Gamble Company ( P G ) for ONJ claims that were pending at the time Warner Chilcott acquired P G s global pharmaceutical business in October 2009. In May and September 2013, Warner Chilcott entered into two settlement agreements that resolved a majority of the then-existing ONJ-related claims which are subject to the acceptance by the individual respective claimants.  
 The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and intends to defend these claims vigorously. Warner Chilcott maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Benicar      Litigation.  The Company is named in approximately 1,740 actions involving allegations that Benicar       , a treatment for hypertension that Forest co-promoted with Daiichi Sankyo between 2002 and 2008, caused certain gastrointestinal injuries. Under Forest s Co-Promotion Agreement, Daiichi Sankyo is defending us in these lawsuits.  
 Celexa     /Lexapro      Litigation . Forest and its affiliates are defendants in approximately 179 actions alleging that Celexa        or Lexapro        caused various birth defects. Several of the cases involve multiple minor-plaintiffs. The majority of these actions have been consolidated in state court in Missouri where one case is set for trial in May 2017. There are also four matters pending in state court in New Jersey where one case is set for trial in February 2017.  There are birth defect cases pending in other jurisdictions, none of which are set for trial.   
 The Company believes it has substantial meritorious defenses to the Celexa     /Lexapro      cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful, or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
   Testosterone Litigation . Beginning in 2014, a number of product liability suits were filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates, as well as other manufacturers and distributors of testosterone products, for personal injuries including but not limited to cardiovascular events allegedly arising out of the use of Androderm       testosterone cypionate, AndroGel and/or testosterone enanthate. Actavis, Inc. and/or one or more of its subsidiaries have been served in approximately 547 currently pending actions, one of which is   
 67 

pending in state courts and the remainder of which are pending in federal court. The federal court actions have been consolidated in an MDL in federal court in Illinois. The defendants have responded to the plaintiffs  master complaint in th  e MDL. Plaintiffs have dismissed all claims relating to any of Actavis  generic TRT products from the cases. These cases are in the initial stages and discovery is ongoing. The Company anticipates that additional suits will be filed. The Company believes t  hat it has substantial meritorious defenses to these cases and maintains product liability insurance against such cases. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. These actions, if successful  , or if insurance does not provide sufficient coverage against such claims, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Government Investigations, Government Litigation and Qui Tam Litigation 
 Forest.  Forest received a subpoena dated August 5, 2013 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. The subpoena requests documents relating to the marketing and promotion of Bystolic       , Savella       , and Namenda       , including with respect to speaker programs for these products. In February 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin unsealed a  qui tam  complaint. The complaint asserts claims under the False Claims Act and contains allegations regarding off-label promotion of Bystolic        and Savella        and  kickbacks  provided to physicians to induce prescriptions of Bystolic       , Savella       , and Viibryd       . Forest moved to dismiss the complaint. On January 6, 2015, the court granted Forest s motion to dismiss the complaint. On February 5, 2016, the relator filed a second amended complaint. The U.S. Attorney s Office declined to intervene in this action but has reserved the right to do so at a later date. On February 23 and 24, 2016, the parties participated in a non-binding mediation. As a result of the mediation, a framework now exists for the parties to reach an agreement to settle this matter. The settlement, if approved, would include the dismissal of the action pending in federal court in Wisconsin.  The Company has recorded a contingent liability for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 under ASC 450, Contingencies, based on its analysis of this matter, however, there can be no assurance that the Company s estimate will not differ materially from the recorded contingent liability.  The Company continues to cooperate with this investigation and to discuss these issues with the government.  
 Forest received a subpoena, dated April 29, 2015, from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General ( OIG ). The subpoena requests documents relating to Average Manufacturer ( AMP ) and Best Price calculations for several of its products. Subsequently, Forest received a Civil Investigative Demand from the OIG, dated August 16, 2016 primarily related to the calculation of Best Price. The Company is cooperating fully with the OIG s requests. 
 In April 2014, the federal district court in Massachusetts unsealed a  qui tam  complaint which asserts claims under the False Claims Act and contains allegations regarding off-label promotion of Namenda     . The Company filed a motion to dismiss the relator s Second Amended Complaint and the court granted in part and denied in part Forest s motion, dismissing the False Claims Act conspiracy claim only. On October 7, 2016, the Company filed a second motion to dismiss the relator s Second Amended Complaint based on newly discovered evidence.  The U.S. Attorney s Office declined to intervene in this action but has reserved the right to do so at a later date.  The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this litigation. However, this case is in the early stages, it is impossible to predict with certain the outcome of this case, and the Company can offer no assurance as to when the lawsuit will be decided, whether the Company will be successful in its defense and whether any additional similar suits will be filed. If this claim is successful, such claim could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
 Forest and certain of its affiliates are defendants in three state court actions pending in Illinois, Utah and Wisconsin involving qui tam actions alleging generally that the plaintiffs (all government agencies) were overcharged for their share of Medicaid drug reimbursement costs. Discovery is ongoing in these actions.  Forest and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss Utah s amended complaint. This motion to dismiss was denied in part, and discovery is proceeding. On February 17, 2014, the Wisconsin state court granted defendants  motion to dismiss plaintiff s Second Amended Complaint. However, the relator filed a separate action making the same basic allegations as in its amended complaint in the original action. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against these actions. At this time, the Company does not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
 On December 28, 2015, a putative class action complaint was filed in state court in Pennsylvania on behalf of a putative class of private payers. Defendants removed the complaint to the federal court in Pennsylvania.  The complaint alleges that manufacturers of generic drugs including a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. that in the past had marketed generic products, caused plaintiffs to overpay for prescription drug products through the use of inflated AWPs. The complaint alleges violations of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, negligent misrepresentation/fraud, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting. Defendants removed this action to the federal court in Pennsylvania under the Class Action Fairness Act. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 29, 2016.  On May 3, 2016, the court issued an order staying all deadlines in this action.  An additional complaint then was filed in state court in Pennsylvania on behalf an individual indirect purchaser containing similar allegations to the class complaint.   
 68 

With regard to the remaining drug pricing actions, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself in those   actions. The Company continually monitors the status of these actions and may settle or otherwise resolve some or all of these matters on terms that the Company deems to be in its best interests. However, the Company can give no assurance that it will be   able to settle the remaining actions on terms it deems reasonable, or that such settlements or adverse judgments in the remaining actions, if entered, will not exceed the amounts of the liability reserves. Additional actions by other states, cities and/or   counties are anticipated. These actions and/or the actions described above, if successful, could adversely affect the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
 Allergan . In December 2011, the federal district court in Pennsylvania issued an order partially unsealing the second amended qui tam complaint, filed by relators Herbert J. Nevyas, M.D. and Anita Nevyas-Wallace, M.D., to be informally provided to Allergan, Inc. The complaint asserts claims under Federal and State False Claims Acts and Federal and State Anti-Kickback Acts. On December 16, 2013, the court entered an order to unseal this qui tam action. On April 1, 2014, Allergan filed a motion to dismiss. On May 26, 2015, the court issued a ruling granting, in part, the motion to dismiss and denying it in part. Allergan filed an answer to the remaining claims on June 25, 2015. On July 7, 2015, the court scheduled trial in this matter for October 31, 2016.  In May 2016, the parties reached a settlement, which remains subject to approval by various Federal and State agencies.  
 On November 25, 2014, prior to the completion of its merger with Actavis plc ( Actavis ), Allergan, Inc. received a request for documents and information from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) related to Actavis or Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Salix ).  On June 30, 2015, Allergan, Inc. received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to Actavis or Salix.  On June 30, 2015, Actavis received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to Allergan.  In January 2016, the SEC began meeting with current and former employees of Allergan and Actavis and indicated that its review focused on the content of Allergan, Inc. s disclosures during the pendency of the tender offer by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International for Allergan, Inc. s common stock. The company is cooperating fully with the SEC in responding to the subpoena. 
 The Company and its affiliates are involved in various other disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquires, investigations and proceedings that could result in litigation, and other litigation matters that arise from time to time. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
   
                 Teva Assumed Liabilities 
 The following matter was assumed by Teva as part of the completion of the divestiture of the Anda Distribution business to Teva on October 3, 2016. 
 Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation.  A putative class action complaint against Anda, Inc. ( Anda ), a subsidiary of the Company, was filed in Missouri state court alleging claims for conversion and alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ) and Missouri Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. An amended complaint alleges that by sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements, Anda misappropriated the class members  paper, toner, ink and employee time when they received the alleged unsolicited faxes, and that the alleged unsolicited facsimile advertisements were sent to the plaintiff in violation of the TCPA and Missouri Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. The complaint seeks to assert class action claims on behalf of the plaintiff and other similarly situated third parties. On May 19, 2011, the plaintiff s filed a motion seeking certification of a class of entities with Missouri telephone numbers who were sent Anda faxes for the period January 2004 through January 2008 but the court vacated the class certification hearing until the FCC Petition, described in more detail below, was addressed. On May 1, 2012, a separate action was filed in federal court in Florida, purportedly on behalf of the  end users of the fax numbers in the United States but outside Missouri to which faxes advertising pharmaceutical products for sale by Anda were sent.  On July 10, 2012, Anda filed its answer and affirmative defenses. The parties filed a joint motion to stay the action pending the resolution of the FCC Petition which the court granted.   
   In a related matter, in November 2010 Anda filed a petition with the FCC, asking the FCC to clarify the statutory basis for its regulation requiring  opt-out  language on faxes sent with express permission of the recipient (the  FCC Petition ). On May 2, 2012, the Consumer   Governmental Affairs Bureau of the FCC dismissed the FCC Petition. On May 14, 2012, Anda filed an application for review of the Bureau s dismissal by the full Commission, requesting the FCC to vacate the dismissal and grant the relief sought in the FCC Petition. The FCC did not rule on the application for review. On June 27, 2013, Forest filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the FCC requesting that the FCC find that (1) the faxes at issue in the action complied, or substantially complied with the FCC regulation, and thus did not violate it, or (2) the FCC regulation was not properly promulgated under the TCPA. On January 31, 2014, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on several other recently-filed petitions, all similar to the one Anda filed in 2010. On October 30, 2014, the FCC issued a final order on the FCC Petition granting Anda and several other petitioners a retroactive waiver of the opt-out notice requirement for all faxes sent with express consent.

The Company recognized a gain on the sale of our global generics business of $15,881.2 million as well as deferred liabilities relating to other elements of our arrangements with Teva of $518.9 million.  
 As part of the Teva Agreement, Teva acquired our global generics business, including the United States ( U.S. ) and international generic commercial units, our third-party supplier Medis, our global generic manufacturing operations, our global generic research and development ( R D ) unit, our international OTC commercial unit (excluding OTC eye care products) and certain established international brands.

 2014 Transactions 
 The following are the significant transactions that were completed in the year ended December 31, 2014. 
 Durata Therapeutics, Inc.  
 On November 17, 2014, the Company completed its tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Durata Therapeutics, Inc. ( Durata ), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for patients with infectious diseases and acute illnesses (the  Durata Acquisition ). The Company purchased all outstanding shares of Durata, which were valued at approximately $724.5 million, including the assumption of debt. Additionally, there is one contingent value right ( CVR ) per share, entitling the holder to receive additional cash payments of up to $5.00 per CVR if certain regulatory or commercial milestones related to Durata s lead product Dalvance    are achieved. The CVR had an acquisition date fair value of $49.0 million. 
 Contingent Consideration  
   At the time of the Durata Acquisition, additional consideration was conditionally due to the seller based upon the approval of Dalvance    in Europe, the approval of a single dose indication and the product reaching certain sales milestones. The Company estimated the acquisition accounting fair value of the contingent consideration to be $49.0 million using a probability weighted approach that considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount rates matched to the timing of the payment, and probability of success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that the European Commission had granted Allergan s subsidiary Durata Therapeutics International B.V., marketing authorization for Xydalba  (dalbavancin) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. The approval triggered the first CVR payment in the quarter ended March 31, 2015 of $30.9 million. In January 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for an expanded label that will include a single dose of  
 84 

Dalvance       , which triggere  d a second CVR payment of $30.9   million in the   quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The difference between the probability weighted fair value and the final payments are recorded as a component of cost of sales.   
 Forest Laboratories, Inc. 
 On July 1, 2014, the Company acquired Forest Laboratories, Inc. ( Legacy Forest ) for $30.9 billion including outstanding indebtedness assumed of $3.3 billion, equity consideration of $20.6 billion, which includes outstanding equity awards, and cash consideration of $7.1 billion (the  Forest Acquisition ). Under the terms of the transaction, Legacy Forest shareholders received 89.8 million Allergan plc ordinary shares, 6.1 million Allergan plc non-qualified stock options and 1.1 million Allergan plc share units.

Operating results 
 Segments  
   During 2016, Allergan announced a realignment of its businesses to streamline operations. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as four distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International  
 85 

and Anda Distribution. Under the new organizational structure being reported, and the decision to sell our Anda Distribution business, the Company organized its businesses   into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs, and the results of corporate initiatives, are managed outside of the three segments.  Prior period results hav  e been recast to align to the current segment presentation.  
 The operating segments are organized as follows: 

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US, including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology, Eye Care, Neurosciences and Urology therapeutic products.     

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the US that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women s Health, Anti-Infectives and Established Brands.     

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the US.     

 The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Included in segment revenues are products sales that are sold through the Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business has sold the product to a third party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are reclassified into revenues from discontinued operations through a reduction of Corporate revenues which eliminates the sales made by our Anda Distribution business from results of continuing operations.  Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third party cost of sales for third party brand products distributed by Anda Distribution. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level: 

Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs.     

General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses located within the United States.     

Total assets including capital expenditures.     

Other select revenues and operating expenses including R D expenses, amortization, IPR D impairments and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.       

 The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements. In March 2015, as a result of the Allergan Acquisition, we began to promote Restasis   , Lumigan   /Ganfort   , Alphagan   /Combigan   , Botox   , Fillers, other aesthetic products and other eye care products.  
 Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges.  Cost of sales included within segment contribution does not include non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles. 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  
 General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.

The following is a reconciliation of net   revenues for the operating segments to the Company s net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):  

No country outside of the United States represents ten percent or more of net revenues. The US Specialized Therapeutics and US General Medicine segments are comprised solely of sales within the United States. 
 The following table represents global net revenues for the top products for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

** Includes an adjustment of $31.7 million recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to International other product revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 that were reported in discontinued operations instead of continuing operations during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The impact of this out-of-period adjustment is not material to the six months ended June 30, 2015 or the three months ended September 30, 2015, and had no impact on the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

US Specialized Therapeutics Segment  
 The following table presents top product sales and net contribution for the US Specialized Therapeutics segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

(1)    
 
   Includes revenues earned that were distributed through the Anda Distribution business to third party customers.    

(2)    
 
   Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights, as well as indirect cost of sales not attributable to segment results .      

(3)    
 
   Defined as net revenues less segment related cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues.    

 Net Revenues 
 The increase in revenues was primarily driven by increases in total Eye Care, Facial Aesthetics and Neuroscience and Urology revenues. 
 Within Eye Care, Restasis    revenues increased $43.6 million, or 13.9%, versus the prior year period primarily due to net price appreciation and demand growth. Alphagan   /Combigan    revenues increased $12.0 million, or 14.7%, versus the prior year period primarily due to net price appreciation. 
 89 

The increase in Facial Aesthetics revenues was driven in part by Botox        Cosmetics which increased $15.2 million, or 9.5%, versus the prior year period primarily due to demand growth.  Also co  ntributing was an increase in Fillers revenues of $15.3 million, or 17.1% versus the prior year period driven primarily by demand growth offset, in part, by modest price depreciation, as well as the launch of Kybella       .  
 Within Medical Dermatology, Aczone    increased $21.0 million, or 43.8%, due to net price appreciation, as well as the launch of Aczone    7.5%. 
 Within Neuroscience and Urology, Botox    Therapeutics revenues increased $44.2 million, or 16.9%, versus the prior year period driven by demand growth. 
 Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to product mix.  Segment gross margins remained stable at 95.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 94.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 The increase in selling and marketing expenses primarily relates to an increase in selling and promotion costs associated with the Facial Aesthetics business driven in part by the launch of Kybella   . The Company also increased promotional effort for Restasis    and Botox    Therapeutics. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative costs is a result of the Company s new operating management structure wherein more costs are directly supporting the operating segments versus corporate functions. Consequently, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of this change.  In addition, there was also a period over period increase in compensation costs.

US General Medicine Segment  
 The following table presents top product sales and net contribution for the US General Medicine segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

(1)    
 
   Includes revenues earned that were distributed through the Anda Distribution business to third party customers.    

(2)    
 
   Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights, as well as indirect cost of sales not attributable to segment results .      

(3)    
 
   Defined as net revenues less segment related cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues.    

 91 

Net Revenues  
 The decrease in segment revenues is primarily due to a decrease in Central Nervous System revenues driven by the loss of exclusivity in July of 2015 for Namenda    IR, which declined by $52.0 million, or 94.7%, versus the prior year period.  Namenda XR    contributed revenues of $146.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decline of $67.6 million, or 31.5%, versus the prior year period due to a decrease in demand coupled with a lower average selling price to maintain formulary coverage.  Central Nervous System revenue declines were offset, in part, by the launch of Vraylar . 
 Growth within our Gastrointestinal franchise was primarily driven by Linzess    and newly launched Viberzi   .   Linzess    revenues increased $46.9 million, or 39.9%, versus the prior year period primarily due to strong demand growth coupled with net price appreciation. Our Asacol   / Delzicol    franchise revenues decreased $69.7 million, or 49.1%, primarily due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol      HD following the launch of an authorized generic in August. A decline in Delzicol      revenues was attributable to decreased demand due to lower promotion and some loss in formulary coverage, offset by net price appreciation.  Offsetting this decline, in part, is royalty revenue of $26.0 million relating to our authorized generic version of Asacol    HD, which is included within  Other revenues . 
 Our Women s Healthcare franchise increase versus the prior year period is primarily due to both price and volume increases within our top products.  Lo Loestrin    increased 17.7% due to strong demand growth and net price appreciation.  Estrace    Cream increased 12.8% as a result of demand growth and modest net price appreciation.  Minastrin    24 increased 14.1% as a result of net price appreciation. 
 The decline in Established Brands revenues is primarily due to loss of exclusivity on certain products and product divestitures.   
 Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in cost of sales was primarily a result of a decrease in product revenues.  Segment gross margins remained stable at 85.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 85.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 The increase in selling and marketing expenses relates to promotional spending associated with recently launched products, including Viberzi    and Vraylar . 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative costs is a result of the Company s new operating management structure wherein more costs are directly supporting the operating segments versus corporate functions. Consequently, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of this change.  In addition, there was also a period over period increase in compensation costs. 
 92 

International Segment  
 The following table presents top product sales and net contribution for the International segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):

   Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights, as well as indirect cost of sales not attributable to segment results .      

(2)    
 
   Defined as net revenues less segment related cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues.    

**    
 
 Includes an adjustment of $31.7 million recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to International other product revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 that were reported in discontinued operations instead of continuing operations during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The impact of this out-of-period adjustment is not material to the six months ended June 30, 2015 or the three months ended September 30, 2015, and had no impact on the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     

 Net Revenues 
 The increase in segment net revenues is primarily due to the performance of total Eye Care and Facial Aesthetics.  Within total Eye Care, Ozurdex    increased $9.4 million, or 27.6% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by demand growth.  Within Facial Aesthetics, Fillers revenues increased $18.9 million, or 24.3% versus the prior year period, primarily resulting from demand growth, offset in part, by unfavorable currency impacts.  Botox    Cosmetic sales also grew 16.9% driven by demand growth, offset in part, by unfavorable currency impacts.  Botox    Therapeutics sales also grew 11.3% driven by demand growth, offset in part, by unfavorable currency impacts. 
 93 

Cost of Sales  
 The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the increase in net revenues, offset, in part, by favorable product mix.  Segment gross margins improved to 86.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 83.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 The increase in selling and marketing expenses relates to promotional spending associated with Ozurdex   , Botox    Cosmetic and Fillers and recent product launches including Earfold   , Belkyra    and Constella   . 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The decrease in general and administrative costs is primarily due to the impact of corporate restructuring programs.   
 Corporate 
 Corporate represents the results of corporate initiatives as well as the impact of select revenues and shared costs.  The following represents the corporate amounts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): 

(1)    
 
 Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights.    

(1)    
 
 Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights.    

   In the three months ended September 30, 2016, integration and restructuring charges were primarily related to the integration of the Legacy Allergan business as well as charges incurred with the terminated merger with Pfizer, Inc. of $18.0 million. The Company  
 94 

incurred charges related to the purchase accounting impact on stock-based compensation related   to   the Allergan and Forest acquisitions, which increased cost of sales, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses.   Inclu  ded in other in the three months ended September 30, 2016 are mark-to-market unrealized losses for foreign currency option contracts that are entered into in order to offset future exposure to movements in currencies of $18.2 million as well as legal settl  ement charges of $40.8 million.   
 Shared costs primarily include above site and unallocated costs associated with running our global manufacturing facilities. The increase in shared cost of sales is primarily due to an increase in costs no longer attributable to the operating segments as the Company continues to streamline and centralize operations.  This has the impact of lowering segment cost of sales and increasing corporate cost of sales versus prior year periods.  In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2016 included higher costs for product validations and capacity expansions. Also, within shared costs are corporate general and administrative expenses.  The decrease in costs versus the prior year period is primarily due to more costs included within operating segments as part of our new management reporting structure, which reduced corporate expenses. 
  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, integration and restructuring charges primarily related to integration of the Allergan and Forest businesses.  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred purchase accounting effects of $292.9 million in cost of sales primarily related to fair value inventory step-up from the Allergan and Forest acquisitions as products were sold to the Company s third party customers. The Company also incurred charges related to the purchase accounting impact on stock-based compensation related to the Allergan and Forest acquisitions, which increased cost of sales, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses.  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred mark-to-market unrealized losses for foreign currency option contracts that are entered into to offset future exposure to movements in currencies of $4.5 million.

 R D expenses consisted of the following components in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions):  

The increase in ongoing operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in clinical trial activity primarily in the Ophthalmology and CNS therapeutic areas.  
 In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had brand related milestone payments relating to the Akarna Transaction of $48.2 million, the Retrosense Transaction of $59.7 million and the Merck Transaction of $100.0 million.

In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $42.0 million in IPR D impairments on a gastroenterology project as a result of the lack of future availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company made the decision to abandon a select IPR D asset (acquired in connection with the Allergan Acquisition) based on the review of research studies, resulting in an impairment of the full asset value of $300.0 million. 
 Asset sales and impairments, net in the three months ended September 30, 2016, included the gain on the sale of certain investments. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consisted of the following components in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased as a result of the Company fully repaying outstanding term loans with the cash proceeds from the Teva Transaction on August 2, 2016. 
   
 96 

Other (expense) income, net  
 Other (expense) income, net consisted of the following components in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 29.5% compared to 48.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was impacted by income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate and U.S. losses tax benefited at rates greater than the Irish statutory rate. Additionally, the tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included , but not limited to,  the following items: a benefit of $48.2 million related to the change in tax rates applicable to certain temporary differences, a benefit of $37.9 million for the New Jersey Grow income tax credit and a benefit of $15.7 million primarily related to a valuation allowance release in Ireland. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was impacted by income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate and U.S. losses tax benefited at rates greater than the Irish statutory rate. Additionally, the tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2015 included , but not limited to,  the following items: a benefit of $318.9 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance on a portion of U.S. capital loss carryforwards resulting from restructuring associated with the sale of the generics business, a benefit of $36.8 million for the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, a benefit of $41.3 million for certain IPR D impairments and a benefit of $44.0 million for acquired tax attributes. 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the period ended September 30, 2015 is the result of changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with rates other than the Irish statutory rate and the change in the valuation allowance recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015.

 100 

Cost of Sales  
 The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the contribution from the Allergan Acquisition, which contributed a full nine months in 2016 as opposed to six and a half months in 2015.  Segment gross margins remained stable at 94.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 94.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 The increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to the contribution from the Allergan Acquisition, which contributed a full nine months in 2016 as opposed to six and a half months in 2015 as well as costs incurred with recent product launches.  
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the contribution from the Allergan Acquisition, which contributed a full nine months in 2016 as opposed to six and a half months in 2015 and an increase due to the Company s new operating management structure wherein more costs are directly supporting the operating segments versus corporate functions. Consequently, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of this change.  In addition, there was also a period over period increase in compensation costs.

 102 

Net Revenues  
 The decrease in segment revenues is primarily driven by the loss of exclusivity on Namenda    IR, which declined $520.1 million, or 97.6%, versus the prior year period. Namenda XR    contributed revenues of $486.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decline of $83.3 million, or 14.6%, versus the prior year period due to a decline in average net selling price to maintain strong formulary, coupled with a decline in demand. The launches of Namzaric    and Vraylar    have partially offset the impact of the decline of Namenda    IR and XR. 
 Growth within our Gastrointestinal franchise was primarily driven by Linzess    and newly launched Viberzi   .  Linzess    revenues increased $126.9 million, or 39.0%, versus the prior year period primarily due to strong demand growth and price appreciation.  The Asacol    / Delzicol    franchise revenues decreased $109.9 million, or 26.9% primarily due to a reduction in demand as a result of lower promotion and some loss in formulary coverage, offset, in part, by net price appreciation.  In addition, an authorized generic of Asacol    HD was launched in August. Offsetting this decline, in part, is royalty revenue of $26.0 million relating to our authorized generic version of Asacol    HD, which is included within  Other Revenues . 
 Our Women s Healthcare franchise increased $148.4 million or 20.7%, versus the prior year period.  Lo Loestrin    increased 17.6% due to strong demand growth and modest net price appreciation. Estrace    Cream increased 20.5% as a result of net price appreciation and modest demand growth. Minastrin    24 increased 26.7% primarily as a result of net price appreciation. 
 The decline in Established Brands revenues is primarily due to loss of exclusivity on certain products and product divestitures.     
 Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decline in product revenues as well as an unfavorable product mix.  Segment gross margins declined to 85.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 86.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses  
 A modest decrease in selling and marketing expenses is attributable to the overall decline in revenues offset, in part, by redeployment of promotional efforts to key growth brands including newly launched products Viberzi    and Vraylar . 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative costs is a result of the Company s new operating management structure wherein more costs are directly supporting the operating segments versus corporate functions. Consequently, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of this change.  In addition, there was also a period over period increase in compensation costs.

 Borrowings under the AGN Term Loan bore interest at our choice of a per annum rate equal to either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin per annum varying from (x) 0.00% per annum to 1.00% per annum under the AGN Three Year Tranche and (y) 0.125% per annum to 1.250% per annum under the AGN Five Year Tranche, depending on the Debt Rating or (b) a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin varying from (x) 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum under the AGN Three Year Tranche and (y) 1.125% per annum to 2.250% per annum under the AGN Five Year Tranche, depending on the Debt Rating. The outstanding principal amount of loans under the AGN Three Year Tranche was not subject to quarterly amortization and was payable in full on the maturity date. The outstanding principal amount of loans under the AGN Five Year Tranche was payable in equal quarterly amounts of 2.50% per quarter prior to March 17, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on March 17, 2020.   
 Cash Bridge Loan Facility 
 On March 11, 2015, Allergan and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a 60-day senior unsecured bridge credit agreement (the  Cash Bridge Loan Facility ), among Actavis Capital, as borrower, Allergan plc, Warner Chilcott Limited, Actavis Finance, LLC Actavis Funding SCS, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the  Cash Bridge Lenders ), JPMCB, as administrative agent and the other financial institutions party thereto. Under the Cash Bridge Loan Facility, the Cash Bridge Lenders committed to provide, subject to certain conditions, unsecured bridge financing, of which $2.8 billion was drawn to finance the Allergan Acquisition on March 17, 2015. The outstanding balance of the Cash Bridge Loan Facility was repaid on April 9, 2015. 
 Borrowings under the Cash Bridge Loan Facility bore interest at our choice of a per annum rate equal to either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin per annum varying from 0.00% per annum to 1.00% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating or (b) a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin varying from 1.00% per annum to 2.00% per annum, depending on the Debt Rating. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

ITEM  3.   
 
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

 The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of our investments (Investment Risk), the impact of interest rate changes (Interest Rate Risk) and the impact of foreign currency exchange changes (Foreign Currency Exchange Risk). 
 We maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including both government and government agency obligations with ratings of A or better and money market funds. Our investments in marketable securities are governed by our investment policy which seeks to preserve the value of our principal, provide liquidity and maximize return on the Company s investment against minimal interest rate risk. Consequently, our interest rate and principal risk are minimal on our non-equity investment portfolio. The quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth below. 
 Investment Risk  
 As of September 30, 2016, our total investments in marketable and equity securities of other companies, including equity method investments, but excluding securities considered cash and cash equivalents were $19,936.1 million (included in marketable securities and investments and other assets). The fair values of these investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions. 
 As of August 2, 2016, the Company owns 100.3 million Teva ordinary shares, which are subject to changes in value based on the price of Teva shares.  The Company is subject to lock-up restrictions with the investment in Teva, and as such, is also subject to liquidity risk. 
 116 

We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and recognize losses, for income statement purposes, when events and circumstances indicate that any declines in the fai  r values of such investments below our accounting basis are other than temporary.  
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our non-equity investment portfolio and our floating rate debt. Our cash is invested in bank deposits and A-rated or better money market mutual funds. 
 Our portfolio of marketable securities includes U.S. treasury and agency securities classified as available-for-sale securities, with no security having a maturity in excess of two years. These securities are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Because of the short-term nature of these investments, we are subject to minimal interest rate risk and do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the realized value of our portfolio. 
 Floating Rate Debt 
 At September 30, 2016, borrowings outstanding under the floating rate notes were $1,000.0 million. Assuming a one percent increase in the applicable interest rate on the Company s floating rates notes, annual interest expense would increase by approximately $10.0 million over the next twelve months.  
 Fixed Rate Debt 
 The Company has outstanding borrowings under its fixed rate notes. Changes in market interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Overall, we are a net recipient of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect our consolidated revenues or operating costs and expenses as expressed in U.S. dollars. 
 From time to time, we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management to focus its attention on our core business issues. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to allow the Company at its option to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses. We enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures. 
 We use foreign currency option contracts, which provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies, if exercised, to economically hedge the currency exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions that arise in the normal course of our business. Probable but not firmly committed transactions are comprised primarily of sales of products and purchases of raw material in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The foreign currency option contracts are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily earnings denominated in the Euro. While these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures.   
 Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Other 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or operations, nor do we have any material commodity price risks.

ITEM 4.   
 
          CONTROLS   AND PROCEDURES     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective. 
 As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation and because of the material weakness described below the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016. 
 Material Weakness and Remediation Plans 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Our internal controls did not operate effectively to appropriately assess the tax implications of certain transactions between our subsidiaries. This control deficiency did not result in the material misstatement of our current or prior period consolidated financial statements. However, this control deficiency could have resulted in a misstatement to the income tax accounts and disclosures, which would have resulted in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.  
 Management has begun to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses above including adding resources and reassessing existing controls and income tax reporting policies and procedures.   
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Without prejudice to the authority conferred on the Directors pursuant to article 3 to issue preferred shares in the capital of the Company, if at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares the rights attached to any class may, whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the Holders of three-fourths of the issued shares in that class, or with the sanction of a Special Resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the Holders of the shares of that class, provided that, if the relevant class of Holders has only one Holder, that person present in person or by proxy, shall constitute the necessary quorum.

6.4   
 
 The issue of preferred shares or any class of preferred shares which rank junior to any existing preferred shares or class of preferred shares shall not constitute a variation of the existing preferred shares or class of preferred shares.

 If at any time the Directors are satisfied that any member, or any other person appearing to be interested in shares held by such member: (x) has been duly served with a Disclosure Notice and is in default for the prescribed period (as defined in article 13.6(b)) in supplying to the Company the information thereby required; or (y) in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which is false or inadequate in a material particular, then the Directors may, in their absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a " direction notice ") to such member direct that:    

(a)   
 
 in respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred (the " default shares ") the member shall not be entitled to attend or to vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the Company; and    

(b)   
 
 where the nominal value of the default shares represents at least 0.25 per cent. of the nominal value of the issued shares of the class concerned, then the direction notice may additionally direct that:    

(i)   
 
 except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any sums due from the Company on the default shares, whether in respect of capital or dividend or otherwise, and the Company shall not have any liability to pay interest on any such payment when it is finally paid to the member;    

(ii)   
 
 no other distribution shall be made on the default shares; and / or    

(iii)   
 
 no transfer of any of the default shares held by such member shall be registered unless:    

(1)   
 
 the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information requested and the transfer when presented for registration is accompanied by a certificate by the member in such form as the Directors may in their absolute discretion require to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the member is satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying such information is interested in any of the shares the subject of the transfer; or    

(2)   
 
 the transfer is an approved transfer (as defined in article 13.6(c)),    

 the Company shall send to each other person appearing to be interested in the shares the subject of any direction notice a copy of the notice, but the failure or omission by the Company to do so shall not invalidate such notice. 

13.2   
 
 Where any person appearing to be interested in the default shares has been duly served with a direction notice or copy thereof and the default shares which are the subject of such direction notice are held by an Approved Nominee, the provisions of this article shall be treated as applying only to such default shares held by the Approved Nominee and not (insofar as such person's apparent interest is concerned) to any other shares held by the Approved Nominee.    

13.3   
 
 Where the member upon whom a Disclosure Notice is served is an Approved Nominee acting in its capacity as such, the obligations of the Approved Nominee as a member of the Company shall be limited to disclosing to the Company such information as has been recorded by it relating to any person appearing to be interested in the shares held by it.    

 13 
 28805560.1 

13.4   
 
    Any direction notice shall cease to have effect:     

(a)   
 
 in relation to any shares which are transferred by such member by means of an approved transfer; or    

(b)   
 
 when the Directors are satisfied that such member, and any other person appearing to be interested in shares held by such member, has given to the Company the information required by the relevant Disclosure Notice.    

13.5   
 
 The Directors may at any time give notice cancelling a direction notice.     

13.6   
 
 For the purposes of this article:    

(a)   
 
 a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any shares if the member holding such shares has given to the Company a response to a Disclosure Notice which either (a) names such person as being so interested or (b) fails to establish the identities of all those interested in the shares and (after taking into account the said response and any other relevant information provided pursuant to a Disclosure Notice) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person in question is or may be interested in the shares;    

(b)   
 
   the prescribed period is 28 days from the date of service of the said Disclosure Notice unless the nominal value of the default shares represents at least 0.25 per cent of the nominal value of the issued shares of that class, when the prescribed period is 14 days from that date;     

(c)   
 
   a transfer of shares is an approved transfer if but only if:    

(i)   
 
 it is a transfer of shares to an offeror by way or in pursuance of acceptance of an offer made to all the Holders (or all the Holders other than the person making the offer and his nominees) of the shares in the Company to acquire those shares or a specified proportion of them; or    

(ii)   
 
 the Directors are satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a sale of the whole of the beneficial ownership of the shares the subject of the transfer to a party unconnected with the member and with other persons appearing to be interested in such shares; or    

(iii)   
 
 the transfer results from a sale made through a stock exchange on which the Company's shares are normally traded.    

13.7   
 
 Nothing contained in this article shall limit the power of the Company under section 1066 of the Act.    

13.8   
 
 For the purpose of establishing whether or not the terms of any notice served under this article shall have been complied with the decision of the Directors in this regard shall be final and conclusive and shall bind all persons interested.

The Directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this article. The Company's lien on a share shall extend to all dividends payable thereon.    

15   
 
 The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any shares on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is immediately payable, nor until the expiration of 14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is immediately payable, has been given to the Holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.    

16   
 
 To give effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the Holder of the shares comprised in any such     

 14 
 28805560.1 

transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale. Where a   s  hare, which is to be sold as provided for in article   26  , is held in uncertificated form, the Directors may authorise some person to do all that is necessary under the   Companies   Act 1990 (Uncertificated Securities) Regulations 1996   (  S.I. No. 68 of 1996  )     and /   or   under any   regulations made under section 1086 of the Act to change such share into certificated form prior to its sale.     

17   
 
 The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the Company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is immediately payable, and the residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not immediately payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.    

18   
 
 Whenever any law for the time being of any country, state or place imposes or purports to impose any immediate or future or possible liability upon the Company to make any payment or empowers any government or taxing authority or government official to require the Company to make any payment in respect of any shares registered in the Register as held either jointly or solely by any Holder or in respect of any dividends, bonuses or other moneys due or payable or accruing due or which may become due or payable to such Holder by the Company on or in respect of any shares registered as aforesaid or for or on account or in respect of any Holder and whether in consequence of:    

(  a  )   
 
 the death of such Holder;    

(  b  )   
 
 the non-payment of any income tax or other tax by such Holder;    

(  c  )   
 
 the non-payment of any estate, probate, succession, death, stamp, or other duty by the executor or administrator of such Holder or by or out of his estate; or    

(  d  )   
 
 any other act or thing,    

 in every such case (except to the extent that the rights conferred upon Holders of any class of shares render the Company liable to make additional payments in respect of sums withheld on account of the foregoing): 

(A)   
 
 the Company shall be fully indemnified by such Holder or his executor or administrator from all liability;    

(B)   
 
 the Company shall have a lien upon all dividends and other moneys payable in respect of the shares registered in the Register as held either jointly or solely by such Holder for all moneys paid or payable by the Company in respect of such shares or in respect of any dividends or other moneys as aforesaid thereon or for or on account or in respect of such Holder under or in consequence of any such law together with interest at the rate of fifteen percent per annum thereon from the date of payment to date of repayment and may deduct or set off against such dividends or other moneys payable as aforesaid any moneys paid or payable by the Company as aforesaid together with interest as aforesaid;    

(C)   
 
 the Company may recover as a debt due from such Holder or his executor or administrator wherever constituted any moneys paid by the Company under or in consequence of any such law and interest thereon at the rate and for the period aforesaid in excess of any dividends or other moneys as aforesaid then due or payable by the Company;    

(D)   
 
 the Company may, if any such money is paid or payable by it under any such law as aforesaid, refuse to register a transfer of any shares by any such Holder or his executor or administrator until such money and interest as aforesaid is set off or deducted as aforesaid, or in case the same exceeds the amount of any such dividends or other moneys as aforesaid then due or payable by the Company, until such excess is paid to the Company; and    

(E)   
 
 subject to the rights conferred upon the Holders of any class of shares, nothing herein contained shall prejudice or affect any right or remedy which any law may confer or purport to confer on the Company and as between the Company and every such Holder as aforesaid, his estate representative, executor, administrator and estate wheresoever constituted or situate, any right or remedy which such law shall confer or purport to confer on the Company shall be enforceable by the Company.    

 15 
 28805560.1 

Calls on   s  hares  

19   
 
 The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times or in accordance with such terms of allotment, and each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 days notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the Directors may determine.    

20   
 
 A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments.    

21   
 
 The joint Holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.    

22   
 
 If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.    

23   
 
 Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall for the purpose of these articles be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which, by the terms of issue, the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of these articles as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise, shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.    

24   
 
 The Directors may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the Holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the time of payment.    

25   
 
 The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced may (until the same would, but for such advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding (unless the Company in general meeting otherwise directs) fifteen per cent per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the member paying such sum in advance.    

 Transfer of Shares 

26.1   
 
 Subject to compliance with the Acts and to any applicable restrictions contained in these articles, applicable law, including U.S. securities laws, and any agreement binding on such Holder as to which the Company is aware, any Holder may transfer all or any of its shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual common form or in any other form or by any other method permissible under applicable law, as may be approved by the Directors. The instrument of transfer of any share may be executed for and on behalf of the transferor by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any duly authorised delegate or attorney of the Secretary or Assistant Secretary (whether an individual, a corporation or other body of persons, whether corporate or not, and whether in respect of specific transfers or pursuant to a general standing authorisation) and the Secretary or Assistant Secretary or a relevant authorised delegate shall be deemed to have been irrevocably appointed agent for the transferor of such share or shares with full power to execute, complete and deliver in the name of and on behalf of the transferor of such share or shares all such transfers of shares held by the members in the share capital of the Company. Any document which records the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, the class and number of shares agreed to be transferred and the date of the agreement to transfer shares, shall, once executed by the transferor or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary or relevant authorised delegate as agent for the transferor, be deemed to be a proper instrument of transfer for the purposes of section 94 of the Act. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the Holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered on the Register in respect thereof, and neither the title of the transferee nor the title of the transferor shall be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale should the Directors so determine.    

 16 
 28805560.1 

26.2   
 
    The Company, at its absolute discretion, may, or may procure that a subsidiary of the Company shall, pay Irish stamp duty arising on a transfer of   s  hares on behalf of the transferee of such   s  hares   of the Company  . If stamp duty resulting from the transfer of   s  hares in the Company which would otherwise be payable by the transferee is paid by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company on behalf of the transferee, then in those circumstances, the Company shall, on its behalf or on behalf of its subsidiary (as the case may be), be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement of the stamp duty from   either   the transferee   or, at the Company s sole discretion, the transferor  ;   (ii) set-off the stamp duty against any dividends payable to the transferee of those shares  ;   and (iii) claim a first and permanent lien on the   s  hares on which stamp duty has been paid by the Company or its subsidiary for the amount of stamp duty paid. The Company's lien shall extend to all dividends paid on those   s  hares.     

26.3   
 
 Notwithstanding the provisions of these articles and subject to any regulations made under section 239 of the Companies Act 1990 or section 1086 of the Act, title to any shares in the Company may also be evidenced and transferred without a written instrument in accordance with regulations made under section 239 of the Companies Act 1990 or under section 1086 of the Act.  The Directors shall have power to permit any class of shares to be held in uncertificated form and to implement any arrangements they think fit for such evidencing and transfer which accord with such regulations and in particular shall, where appropriate, be entitled to disapply or modify all or part of the provisions in these articles with respect to the requirement for written instruments of transfer and share certificates (if any), in order to give effect to such regulations.    

27   
 
 Subject to such of the restrictions of these articles and to such of the conditions of issue of any share warrants as may be applicable, any share warrant may be transferred by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or any other form which the Directors may approve.    

28   
 
 The Directors in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor may decline to register any transfer of a share which is not fully paid. The Directors may also decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless:    

28.1   
 
 the instrument of transfer is duly stamped (if required by law) and lodged with the Company, at such place as the Directors shall appoint for the purpose, accompanied by the certificate for the shares (if any has been issued) to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;    

28.2   
 
 the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; and    

28.3   
 
 they are satisfied that all applicable consents, authorisations, permissions or approvals required to be obtained pursuant to any applicable law or agreement prior to such transfer have been obtained or that no such consents, authorisations, permissions or approvals are required.    

29   
 
 If the Directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to the transferee notice of the refusal.    

30   
 
 In order that the Directors may determine the members entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of shares, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining members for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Directors adopt the resolution relating thereto.    

31   
 
 Registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such period, not exceeding in the whole 30 days in each year, as the Directors may from time to time determine subject to the requirements of section 174 of the Act.    

32   
 
 All instruments of transfer shall upon their being lodged with the Company remain the property of the Company and the Company shall be entitled to retain them.    

 17 
 28805560.1 

Transmission of Shares  

33   
 
 In the case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors, where the deceased was a joint Holder, and the personal representatives of the deceased where he was a sole Holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint Holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons. For greater certainty, where two or more persons are registered as joint Holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint Holder or Holders the remaining joint Holder or Holders shall be absolutely entitled to the said share or shares and the Company shall recognise no claim in respect of the estate of any joint Holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint Holders.    

34   
 
 Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the Directors and subject as herein provided, elect either to be registered himself as Holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof, but the Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the shares by that member before his death or bankruptcy, as the case may be. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects.  If he elects to have another person registered, he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these articles relating to the right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred and the notice of transfer were a transfer signed by that member.    

35   
 
 A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the Holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered Holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to the meetings of the Company, so, however, that the Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share, and if the notice is not complied with within 60 days, the Directors may thereupon withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other moneys payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.    

 Forfeiture of Shares 

36   
 
 If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the Directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued.    

37   
 
 The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that, in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.    

38   
 
 If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with any shares in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect.  Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture.    

39   
 
 A forfeited share shall be deemed to be the property of the Company and may be sold, re-offered or otherwise disposed of either to the person who was, before the forfeiture, the Holder thereof or entitled thereto or to any other person on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit.    

40   
 
 When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be served upon the person who was before forfeiture the Holder of the share, but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or neglect to give such notice.    

 18 
 28805560.1 

41   
 
    A person whose   s  hares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the Company all mon  eys   which, at the date of forfeiture, were payable by him to the Company in respect of the   s  hares, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company shall have received payment in full of all such mon  eys   in respect of the   s  hares.     

42   
 
 A statutory declaration that the declarant is a Director or the Secretary, and that a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on the date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.  The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on any sale or disposition thereof and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of and he shall thereupon be registered as the Holder of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.    

43   
 
 The provisions of these articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.    

44   
 
 The Directors may accept the surrender of any share which the Directors have resolved to have been forfeited upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed and, subject to any such terms and conditions, a surrendered share shall be treated as if it has been forfeited.    

 Financial assistance 

45   
 
 The Company may give any form of financial assistance which is permitted by the Acts for the purpose of or in connection with an acquisition by subscription, purchase, exchange or otherwise, made or to be made by any person of or for any shares in the Company or in the Company s holding company.    

 Alteration of Capital 

46   
 
 The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its authorised share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such amount, as the resolution shall prescribe.    

47   
 
   In addition, and without prejudice, to the Company s rights under section 83 of the Act, the Company may by Ordinary Resolution:    

47.1   
 
 reduce its authorised share capital;    

47.2   
 
 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares;    

47.3   
 
 subdivide its existing shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by this constitution;    

47.4   
 
 make provision for the issue and allotment of shares which do not carry any voting rights;    

47.5   
 
 cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and reduce the amount of its authorised share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled; and    

47.6   
 
 subject to applicable law, change the currency denomination of its share capital.    

 Where any difficulty arises in regard to any division, consolidation or sub-division under this article 47, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and in particular, may arrange for the sale of the shares representing fractions and the distribution of the net proceeds of sale in due proportion amongst the Holders who would have been entitled to the fractions, and for this purpose the Directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares representing fractions to the purchaser thereof, who shall not be bound to see to the application of purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings related to the sale. 
 19 
 28805560.1 

48   
 
      In accordance with section 84 of the Act, the Company may by Special Resolution reduce its issued share capital, any capital redemption reserve fund, any share premium account or any undenominated capital in any manner and with   and   subject to any incident authorised, and consent required, by law. Nothing in this Article 48 shall  ,     however,   prejudice or limit the Company s ability to perform or engage in any of the actions described in section 83(1) of the Act by way of Ordinary Resolution only.     

 General meetings 

49   
 
 The Company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meeting in that year, and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it.  Not more than 15 months shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of the Company and that of the next.  Subject to section 176 of the Act, all general meetings of the Company may be held outside of Ireland.    

50   
 
 All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary general meetings.    

51   
 
 The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting, and extraordinary general meetings shall also be convened on such requisition, or in default may be convened by such requisitionists, as provided in section 178(3) of the Act.    

52   
 
   All provisions of these articles relating to general meetings of the Company shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to every separate general meeting of the Holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, except that:    

52.1   
 
 the necessary quorum shall be two or more persons holding or representing by proxy (whether or not such Holder actually exercises his voting rights in whole, in part or at all at the relevant general meeting) more than 50% of the total issued-voting rights of the Company s shares, provided, however, that if the class of shares shall have only one Holder, one Holder present in person or by proxy shall constitute the necessary quorum;    

52.2   
 
 any Holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll; and    

52.3   
 
 on a poll, each Holder of shares of the class shall have one vote in respect of every share of the class held by him.    

53   
 
 A Director shall be entitled, notwithstanding that he is not a member, to attend and speak at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the Holders of any class of shares in the Company.    

 Notice of General Meetings 

54.1   
 
 Subject to the provisions of the Acts allowing a general meeting to be called by shorter notice, an annual general meeting, and an extraordinary general meeting called for the passing of a Special Resolution, shall be called by not less than 21 Clear Days' notice and all other extraordinary general meetings shall be called by not less than 14 Clear Days' notice.    

54.2   
 
 Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner permitted by these articles to all Shareholders (other than those who, under the provisions of these articles or the terms of issue of the shares which they hold, are not entitled to receive such notice from the Company) and to each Director and to the Auditors.     

54.3   
 
 Any notice convening a general meeting shall specify the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of that business and, in reasonable prominence, that a member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote in his place and that a proxy need not be a member of the Company.  It shall also give particulars of any Directors who are to retire at the meeting and of any persons who are recommended by the Directors for election or re-election as Directors at the meeting or in respect of whom notice has been duly given to the Company of the intention to propose them for election or re-election as Directors at the meeting.  Provided that the latter requirement shall only apply where the intention to propose the person has been received by the Company in accordance with the provisions of these articles.      

 20 
 28805560.1 

Subject to any restrictions imposed on any   s  hares, the notice of the meeting shall be given to all the   H  olders of any class of shares of the Company as of the record date set by the Directors other than   s  hares which, under the terms of these articles or the terms of allotment of such   s  hares, are not entitled to receive such notice from the Company, and to the Directors and the   A  uditors.     

54.4   
 
 The Board may fix a future time not exceeding 60 days preceding any meeting of Shareholders as a record date for the determination of the Shareholders entitled to attend and vote at any such meeting or any adjournments thereof, and, in such case, only Shareholders of record at the time so fixed shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meetings or any adjournment thereof.  Subject to section 174 of the Act, the Board may close the Register against transfers of Shares during the whole or part of the period between the record date so fixed and the date of such meeting or the date to which such meeting is adjourned.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining the Shareholders who are entitled to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be close of business on the date preceding the day on which notice is given.    

54.5   
 
 The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or, in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out without the notice, the accidental omission to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting or instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at the meeting.    

54.6   
 
 A Holder of shares present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the Company or of the Holders of any class of shares in the Company shall be deemed to have received notice of the meeting and, where required, of the purposes for which it was called.    

54.7   
 
 Upon request in writing of Shareholders holding such number of shares as is prescribed by section 178(3) of the Act, delivered to the Office, it shall be the duty of the Directors to convene a general meeting to be held within two months from the date of the deposit of the requisition in accordance with the section 178(3) of the Act.  If such notice is not given within two months after the delivery of such request, the requisitionists, or any one of them representing more than one half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves convene a meeting, but any meeting so convened shall not be held after the expiration of three months from the said date and any notice of such meeting shall be in compliance with these articles.    

55.1   
 
 The Directors may postpone a general meeting of the members (other than a meeting requisitioned by a member in accordance with section 178(3) of the Act or where the postponement of which would be contrary to the Acts or a court order pursuant to the Acts) after it has been convened, and notice of such postponement shall be served in accordance with article 54 upon all members entitled to notice of the meeting so postponed setting out, where the meeting is postponed to a specific date, notice of the new meeting in accordance with article 54.    

55.2   
 
 The Directors may cancel a general meeting of the members (other than a meeting requisitioned by a member in accordance with section 178(3) of the Act or where the cancellation of which would be contrary to the Acts or a court order pursuant to the Acts) after it has been convened, and notice of such cancellation shall be served in accordance with article 54 upon all members entitled to notice of the meeting so cancelled.    

 Proceedings at General Meetings 

56   
 
 No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.  Except as otherwise provided in these articles, a quorum shall be two or more persons holding or representing by proxy (whether or not such Holder actually exercises his voting rights in whole, in part or at all at the relevant general meeting) more than 50% of the total issued voting rights of the Company's shares, provided that if the Company has only one member, one member present in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum.    

57   
 
 If within five minutes from the time appointed for a general meeting (or such longer interval as the chairman of the meeting may think fit to allow) a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the     

 21 
 28805560.1 

requisition of members, shall be dissolved. In any other case it shall stand adjourned to such other day and such other time and place as the chairman of the meeting shall determine.      The Company shall give not less than five days  notice of any meeting adjourned through want of a quorum.     

58   
 
 All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting.  All business that is transacted at an annual general meeting shall also be deemed special, with the exception of:    

(a)   
 
 the consideration of the Company s statutory financial statements and the report of the Directors and the report of the Auditors on those statements and that report;    

(b)   
 
 the review by the members of the Company s affairs;    

(c)   
 
 the declaration of a dividend (if any) of an amount not exceeding the amount recommended by the Directors;    

(d)   
 
 the authorisation of the Directors to approve the remuneration of the Auditors;    

(e)   
 
 the election of Directors in place of those retiring (whether by rotation or otherwise); and    

59   
 
 A meeting of the members or any class thereof may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limitation of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence at such meeting.    

60   
 
 No business may be transacted at a meeting of members, other than business that is either proposed by or at the direction of the Directors; proposed at the direction of the High Court of Ireland; proposed on the requisition in writing of such number of members as is prescribed by, and is made in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the Acts and, in respect of an annual general meeting only, these articles; or the chairman of the meeting determines in his absolute and sole discretion that the business may properly be regarded as within the scope of the meeting.  For business or nominations to be properly brought by a member at any general meeting, the member proposing such business must be a Holder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in articles 54   and 55 and must be entitled to vote at such meeting and any proposed business must be a proper matter for member action.    

61.1   
 
 Subject to the Acts, a resolution may only be put to a vote at a general meeting of the Company if:     

(a)   
 
 it is specified in the notice of the meeting; or    

(b)   
 
 it is otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the chairman of the meeting or by or at the direction of the Board; or     

(c)   
 
 it is proposed at the direction of a court of competent jurisdiction; or    

(d)   
 
 it is proposed with respect to an extraordinary general meeting in the requisition in writing for such meeting made by such number of Shareholders as is prescribed by (and such requisition in writing is made in accordance with) section 178(3) of the Act; or    

(e)   
 
 in the case of an annual general meeting, it is proposed in accordance with article 70; or    

(f)   
 
 it is proposed in accordance with article 118; or    

(g)   
 
 the chairman of the meeting in his discretion decides that the resolution may properly be regarded as within the scope of the meeting.    

 22 
 28805560.1 

62   
 
    No amendment may be made to a resolution at or before the time when it is put to a vote unless the chairman of the meeting in his absolute discretion decides that the amendment or the amended resolution may properly be put to a vote at that meeting.     

63   
 
 If the chairman of the meeting rules a resolution or an amendment to a resolution admissible or out of order, as the case may be, the proceedings of the meeting or on the resolution in question shall not be invalidated by any error in his ruling.  Any ruling by the chairman of the meeting in relation to a resolution or an amendment to a resolution shall be final and conclusive, subject to any subsequent order by a court of competent jurisdiction.    

64   
 
 The Chairman, if any, of the Board, shall preside as chairman at every meeting of the Company, or if there is no such Chairman, or if he is not present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or is unwilling to act, the Directors present shall elect one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.    

65   
 
 If at any meeting no Director is willing to act as chairman of the meeting or if no Director is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the members present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.    

66   
 
 The chairman of the meeting may, with the consent of any meeting at which a quorum is present, and shall if so directed by the meeting, adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for three months or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of the original meeting.  Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting.    

67   
 
 The Board may, and at any general meeting or meeting of a class of members, the chairman of such meeting may, make any arrangement and impose any requirement or restriction it or he considers appropriate to ensure the security of the meeting including, without limitation, requirements for evidence of identity to be produced by those attending the meeting, the searching of their personal property and the restriction of items that may be taken into the meeting place.  The Board and, at any general meeting or meeting of a class of members, the chairman of such meeting, is entitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply with any such arrangements, requirements or restrictions.    

68.1   
 
   The Board may make such arrangements as it considers appropriate to enable the members to participate in any general meeting by means of two-way, audio-visual electronic facilities, so as to permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.    

68.2   
 
 The Board may, and at any general meeting or meeting of a class of members, the chairman of such meeting may make any arrangement and impose any requirement as may be reasonable for the purpose of verifying the identity of members participating by way of electronic facilities, as described in article 68.1.    

 23 
 28805560.1 

69   
 
      Subject to section   193   of the Act and the requirements of the Act  s  , anything which may be done by resolution in general meeting may, without a meeting and without any previous notice being required, be done by resolution in writing, signed by all of the Shareholders entitled generally to vote at general meetings who at the date of the resolution in writing would be entitled to attend a meeting and vote on the resolution and if described as a   Special Resolution   shall be deemed to be a Special Resolution or a Special Resolution of the class, as applicable.  Such resolution in writing may be signed in as many counterparts as may be necessary.  This article   69   shall not apply to those matters required by the Act  s   to be carried out in a meeting.         

69.1   
 
 For the purposes of any written resolution under this article 69, the date of the resolution in writing is the date when the resolution is signed by, or on behalf of, the last Shareholder to sign and any reference in any enactment to the date of passing of a resolution is, in relation to a resolution in writing made in accordance with this article 69, a reference to such date.    

69.2   
 
 A resolution in writing made in accordance with this article 69 is as valid as if it had been passed by the Company in general meeting.

If requested by the Company, the information required under clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the preceding sentence shall be supplemented by such member and any Member Associated Person not later than   ten   days after the later of the record date for the meeting or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed to disclose such information as of the record date;   and     

(c)

The chairman of such meeting shall, if the facts reasonably warrant, refuse to acknowledge that a proposal that is not made in compliance with the procedure specified in this article, and any such proposal not properly brought before the meeting, be considered. 

73.1   
 
 A member's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each person whom the member proposes to nominate for election as a Director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors in an election contest, or as otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as nominee and to serving as Director if elected); and    

(a)   
 
 the name and address, as they appear in the Register, of such member and any Member Associated Person covered by clause (b) below; and

 25 
 28805560.1 

73.2   
 
    The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require, including the completion of any questionnaires to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director   of the Company   and the impact that such service would have on the ability of the Company to satisfy the requirements of laws, rules, regulations and listing standards applicable to the Company or its Directors.     

73.3   
 
 The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article, and if any proposed nomination is not in compliance with this article, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded.  The chairman of such meeting shall, if the facts reasonably warrant, refuse to acknowledge a nomination that is not made in compliance with the procedure specified in this article, and any such nomination not properly brought before the meeting shall not be considered.    

74   
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of articles 72 and 73, unless otherwise required by law, if the member (or a qualified representative of the member) does not appear at the annual general meeting to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company.  For purposes of articles 72 and 73, to be considered a qualified representative of the member, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such member or must be authorized by a writing executed by such member or an electronic transmission delivered by such member to act for such member as proxy at the meeting of member and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the general meeting of members.    

75   
 
 In addition, if the member intends to solicit proxies from the members of the Company, such member shall notify the Company of this intent in accordance with Rule 14a-4 and / or Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Any references in these articles to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to member nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to these articles and compliance with these articles shall be the exclusive means for a member to make nominations or submit proposals for any other business to be considered at an annual general meeting (other than matters brought properly under and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, or any successor rule).  Nothing in these articles shall be deemed to affect any rights of members to request inclusion of proposals in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act.    

 Voting, proxies and corporate representatives 

76   
 
 Except where (i) a greater majority is required by the Acts or these articles; or (ii) where plurality voting is required pursuant to article 121.2, any question, business or resolution proposed at any general meeting shall be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast.     

77   
 
 Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any class of shares, at any meeting of the Company each member present in person shall be entitled to one vote on any question to be decided on a show of hands and each member in person or by proxy shall be entitled on a poll to one vote for each share held by him.    

78   
 
 At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by:    

78.2   
 
 by at least three members present in person or represented by proxy; or    

78.3   
 
 by any member or members present in person or represented by proxy and representing not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; or    

78.4   
 
 by a member or members holding shares in the Company conferring the right to vote at the meeting being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.    

 26 
 28805560.1 

Unless a poll is so demanded, a declaration by the chairman of the meeting that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in the book containing the minutes of the proceedings of the Company, shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.  
 The demand for a poll may be withdrawn. 

79   
 
 Except as provided in article 80, if a poll is duly demanded it shall be taken in such manner as the Chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.    

80   
 
   A poll demanded on the election of the Chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith.  A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken at such time as the Chairman of the meeting directs, and any business other than that on which a poll has been demanded may be proceeded with pending the taking of the poll.    

81   
 
 When there are joint Holders, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint Holders; and for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register.    

82   
 
 A member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction (whether in Ireland or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his committee, receiver, guardian or other person appointed by that court and any such committee, receiver, guardian or other person may vote by proxy on a show of hands or on a poll.  Evidence to the satisfaction of the Directors of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote shall be received at the Office or at such other address as is specified in accordance with these articles for the receipt of appointments of proxy, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised and in default the right to vote shall not be exercisable.    

83   
 
 No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting unless any calls or other sums immediately payable by him in respect of shares in the Company have been paid.    

84   
 
 No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered, and every vote not disallowed at such meeting shall be valid for all purposes.  Any such objection made in due time shall be referred to the Chairman of the meeting, whose decision shall be final and conclusive.    

85   
 
 A Holder entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.    

86.1   
 
 any objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter; or    

86.2   
 
 any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or which might have been rejected; or    

86.3   
 
 any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted,    

 the objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or adjourned meeting on any resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting or, as the case may be, the adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs.  Any objection or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and shall only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides that the same may have affected the decision of the meeting.  The decision of the chairman on such matters shall be final and conclusive. 

87   
 
 Votes may be given either personally or by proxy.    

 27 
 28805560.1 

88.1   
 
 Every member entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote on his behalf and may appoint more than one proxy to attend, speak and vote at the same meeting.  The appointment of a proxy shall be in any form consistent with the Acts which the Directors may approve and, if required by the Company, shall be signed by or on behalf of the appointor.  In relation to written proxies, a body corporate may sign a form of proxy under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer thereof or in such other manner as the Directors may approve.  A proxy need not be a member of the Company.  The appointment of a proxy in electronic or other form shall only be effective in such manner as the Directors may approve. An instrument or other form of communication appointing or evidencing the appointment of a proxy or a corporate representative (other than a standing proxy or representative) together with such evidence as to its due execution as the board may from time to time require, may be returned to the address or addresses stated in the notice of meeting or adjourned meeting or any other information or communication by such time or times as may be specified in the notice of meeting or adjourned meeting or in any other such information or communication (which times may differ when more than one place is so specified) or, if no such time is specified, at any time prior to the holding of the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting at which the appointee proposes to vote, and, subject to the Acts, if not so delivered the appointment shall not be treated as valid.     

88.2   
 
 Without limiting the foregoing, the Directors may from time to time permit appointments of a proxy to be made by means of an electronic or internet communication or facility and may in a similar manner permit supplements to, or amendments or revocations of, any such electronic or internet communication or facility to be made.  The Directors may in addition prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such electronic or internet communication or facility is to be treated as received by the Company.  The Directors may treat any such electronic or Internet communication or facility which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a Holder of a share as sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending that instruction to send it on behalf of that Holder.    

89   
 
 Any body corporate which is a member of the Company may authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of members of the Company and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the body corporate which he represents as that body corporate could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.  The Company may require evidence from the body corporate of the due authorisation of such person to act as the representative of the relevant body corporate.    

90   
 
 An appointment of proxy relating to more than one meeting (including any adjournment thereof) having once been received by the Company for the purposes of any meeting shall not require to be delivered, deposited or received again by the Company for the purposes of any subsequent meeting to which it relates.    

91   
 
   Receipt by the Company of an appointment of proxy in respect of a meeting shall not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting or at any adjournment thereof. An appointment proxy shall be valid, unless the contrary is stated therein, as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.  A standing proxy shall be valid for all meetings and adjournments thereof or resolutions in writing, as the case may be, until notice of revocation is received by the Company.  Where a standing proxy exists, its operation shall be deemed to have been suspended at any meeting or adjournment thereof at which the Holder is present or in respect to which the Holder has specially appointed a proxy.  The Directors may from time to time require such evidence as it shall deem necessary as to the due execution and continuing validity of any standing proxy and the operation of any such standing proxy shall be deemed to be suspended until such time as the Directors determine that they have received the requested evidence or other evidence satisfactory to it.    

92   
 
   A vote given or poll demanded in accordance with the terms of an appointment of proxy or a resolution authorising a representative to act on behalf of a body corporate shall be valid notwithstanding the death or insanity of the principal, or the revocation of the appointment of proxy or of the authority under which the proxy was appointed or of the resolution authorising the representative to act or transfer of the share in respect of which the proxy was appointed or the authorisation of the representative to act was given, provided that no intimation in writing (whether in electronic form or otherwise) of such death, insanity,     

 28 
 28805560.1 

revocation or transfer shall have been received by the Company at the Office before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the appointment of proxy is used or at which the representative acts PROVIDED HOWEVER, that where such intimation is given in electronic form it shall have been received by the Company before the commencement of the meeting.     

93   
 
 The Directors may send, at the expense of the Company, by post, electronic mail or otherwise, to the members forms for the appointment of a proxy (with or without stamped envelopes for their return) for use at any general meeting or at any class meeting, either in blank or nominating any one or more of the Directors or any other persons in the alternative.    

94   
 
 The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll.    

 Directors 

95   
 
   The number of Directors shall (subject to: (a) automatic increases to accommodate the exercise of the rights of Holders of any class or series of shares then in issue having special rights to nominate or appoint Directors in accordance with the terms of issue of such class or series of shares; and / or (b) any resolution passed in accordance with article 121.1) not be less than five nor more than fourteen, with the exact number of Directors (the   Actual Board Size  ) determined from time to time solely by the Board. The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, provided that if the number of the Directors is reduced below the prescribed minimum the remaining Director or Directors shall appoint forthwith an additional Director or additional Directors to make up such minimum or shall convene a general meeting of the Company for the purpose of making such appointment.    

96.1   
 
 Each Director shall be entitled to receive such fees for his services as a Director, if any, as the Board may from time to time determine.  Each Director shall be paid all expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the conduct of the Company s business or in the discharge of his duties as a Director, including his reasonable travelling, hotel and incidental expenses in attending and returning from meetings of the Board or any committee of the Board or general meetings.     

96.2   
 
 Each Director is expressly permitted (for the purposes of section 228(1)(d) of the Act) to use the Company s property subject to such conditions as may be approved by the Board or such conditions as may have been approved pursuant to such authority as may be delegated by the Board in accordance with these articles and including in each case for a Director s own benefit or for the benefit of another person.    

97   
 
 The Board may from time to time determine that, subject to the requirements of the Acts, all or part of any fees or other remuneration payable to any Director of the Company shall be provided in the form of shares or other securities of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or options or rights to acquire such shares or other securities, on such terms as the Board may decide.    

98   
 
 If any Director shall be called upon to perform extra services which in the opinion of the Directors are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a Director, the Company may remunerate such Director either by a fixed sum or by a percentage of profits or otherwise as may be determined by a resolution passed at a meeting of the Directors and such remuneration may be either in addition to or in substitution for any other remuneration to which he may be entitled as a Director.    

99   
 
 No shareholding qualification for Directors shall be required.  A Director who is not a member of the Company shall nevertheless be entitled to attend and speak at general meetings.    

100   
 
 Unless the Company otherwise directs, a Director of the Company may be or become a Director or other officer of, or otherwise interested in, any company promoted by the Company or in which the Company may be interested as Holder or otherwise, and no such Director shall be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or other benefits received by him as a Director or officer of, or from his interest in, such other company.    

 29 
 28805560.1 

Borrowing powers  

101   
 
 Subject to the Act, the Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow or raise money, and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property, assets and uncalled capital or any part thereof and to issue debentures, debenture stock, guarantees and other securities whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party, without any limitation as to amount.    

 Powers and duties of the Directors 

102   
 
 Subject to the provisions of the Acts and these articles, the Board shall manage the business and affairs of the Company and may exercise all of the powers of the Company as are not required by the Acts or by these articles to be exercised by the Company in general meeting.  No alteration of these articles shall invalidate any prior act of the Board which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made.  The powers given by this article shall not be limited by any special power given to the Board by these articles and, except as otherwise expressly provided in these articles, a meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present shall be competent to exercise all of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in or exercisable by the Board.    

103   
 
 The Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney appoint any company, firm or person or body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection of persons dealing with any such attorney as the Directors may think fit, and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him.    

104   
 
   The Company may exercise the powers conferred by the Act with regard to having an official seal for use abroad and such powers shall be vested in the Directors.

 A Director who to his knowledge is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract or proposed contract, transaction or arrangement with the Company and has complied with the Acts and these articles with regard to disclosure of his interest shall be entitled to vote in respect of any contract, transaction or arrangement in which he is so interested and if he shall do so his vote shall be counted, and he shall be taken into account in ascertaining whether a quorum is present, but the resolution with respect to the contract, transaction or arrangement will fail unless it is approved by a majority of the disinterested Directors voting on the resolution.    

106.2   
 
 Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment (including fixing or varying the terms of appointment) of two or more Directors to offices or employments with the Company or any company in which the Company is interested, such proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each Director separately and in such case each of the Directors concerned shall be entitled to vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own appointment.    

106.3   
 
 For the purposes of this article, an interest of a person who is the spouse or a minor child of a Director shall be treated as an interest of the Director.    

106.4   
 
 Nothing in section 228(1)(e) of the Act shall restrict a director from entering into any commitment which has been approved by the Board or has been approved pursuant to such authority as may be delegated by the Board in accordance with these Articles.  It shall be the duty of each Director to obtain the prior approval of the Board, before entering into any commitment permitted by section 228(1)(e)(ii) and 228(2) of the Act.

107   
 
 A Director may hold and be remunerated in respect of any other office or place of profit under the Company or any other company in which the Company may be interested (other than the office of auditor of the Company or any subsidiary thereof) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine, and no Director or intending Director shall be disqualified by his office from contracting or being interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or arrangement with the Company or any such other company either with regard to his tenure of any such other office or place of profit or as vendor, purchaser or otherwise nor shall any Director so contracting or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profits and advantages accruing to him from any such contract or arrangement by reason of such Director holding that office or of the fiduciary relationship thereby established.    

108   
 
 So long as, where it is necessary, a Director declares the nature of his interest at the first opportunity at a meeting of the Board or by writing to the Directors, a Director shall not by reason of his office be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from any office or employment to which these articles allow him to be appointed or from any transaction or arrangement in which these articles allow him to be interested, and no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the ground of any interest or benefit.    

109   
 
 To the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of Ireland, the Company renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to its Directors, officers or members or the affiliates of the foregoing, other than those Directors, officers or members or affiliates who are employees of the Company.  No amendment or repeal of this article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any such Director, officer or member or affiliate of the Company for or with respect to any opportunities of which such Director, officer or member or affiliate becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal.    

110   
 
 The Directors may exercise the voting powers conferred by shares of any other company held or owned by the Company in such manner in all respects as they think fit and in particular they may exercise their voting powers in favour of any resolution appointing the Directors or any of them as Directors or officers of such other company or providing for the payment of remuneration or pensions to the Directors or officers of such other company.    

111   
 
 Any Director may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company, and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director, but nothing herein contained shall authorise a Director or his firm to act as auditor for the Company.    

112   
 
   All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all receipts for money paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the case may be, by such person or persons and in such manner as the Directors shall from time to time by resolution determine.

113.1   
 
 of all appointments of officers made by the Directors;    

113.2   
 
 of the names of the Directors present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and    

113.3   
 
 of all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Company and of the Directors and of committees of Directors.    

114

Any Director shall be entitled to retain any benefit received by him under this article, subject only, where the Acts require, to disclosure to the members and the approval of the Company in general meeting.     

 Disqualification of Directors 

115   
 
 The office of a Director shall be vacated ipso facto if the Director:    

115.1   
 
 is restricted or disqualified to act as a Director under the provisions of Part 14 of the Act; or    

115.2

 At each annual general meeting of the Company, all the Directors shall retire from office and be re-eligible for re-election.    

117   
 
   Upon the resignation or termination of office of any Director, if a new Director shall be appointed to the Board he will be designated to fill the vacancy arising.    

118.1   
 
 No person shall be appointed a Director, unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of this article 118. Nominations of persons for appointment as Directors may be made:    

(a)   
 
 by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Board; or    

(b)   
 
 with respect to election at an annual general meeting, by any Shareholder who holds Ordinary Shares or other shares carrying the general right to vote at general meetings of the Company, who is a Shareholder at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in article 70   and at the time of the relevant annual general meeting, and who timely complies with the notice procedures set forth in articles 71 - 73; or    

(c)   
 
 with respect to election at an extraordinary general meeting requisitioned in accordance with section 178(3) of the Act, by a Shareholder or Shareholders who hold Ordinary Shares or other shares carrying the general right to vote at general meetings of the Company and who make such nomination in the written requisition of the extraordinary general meeting and in compliance with the other provisions of these articles and the Acts relating to nominations of Directors and the proper bringing of special business before an extraordinary general meeting; or    

(d)   
 
 by Holders of any class or series of shares in the Company then in issue having special rights to nominate or appoint Directors in accordance with the terms of issue of such class or series, but only to the extent provided in such terms of issue,     

 (sub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) being the exclusive means for a Shareholder to make nominations of persons for election to the Board). 
 32 
 28805560.1 

118.2   
 
      For nominations of persons for election as Directors at an extraordinary general meeting t  o   be in proper written form, a Shareholder s notice must comply with the requirements outlined in articles 72 and 73.      

118.3   
 
 The determination of whether a nomination of a candidate for election as a Director of the Company has been timely and properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this article 118 will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any nomination has not been timely and properly brought before such meeting, he or she will so declare to the meeting and such defective nomination will be disregarded.    

119   
 
 A retiring Director shall be eligible to be nominated for re-election at an annual general meeting.    

120   
 
 If a Director stands for re-election in circumstances other than a contested election (as such term is defined in article 121.2 below), he shall be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting the Ordinary Resolution for the re-election of such Director has been defeated.    

121.1   
 
 The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase the maximum number of Directors.    

121.2   
 
 Each Director shall be elected by an Ordinary Resolution at an annual general meeting (or an extraordinary general meeting called for that purpose), provided that if, at any general meeting, the election of all Director nominees in this manner would cause the Actual Board Size to be exceeded  (a " contested election "), each of those nominees shall be voted upon as a separate resolution and the Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors.      

 For the purposes of this article 121.2,  elected by a plurality of the votes  means the election of those Director nominees, equalling in number to the number of positions available to be filled at the relevant general meeting (i.e. such that the Actual Board Size is not exceeded), that received the highest number of votes cast in their favour. 

122   
 
 The Company may, by Ordinary Resolution, remove any Director before the expiration of his period of office notwithstanding anything in these articles or in any agreement between the Company and such Director.  Such removal shall be without prejudice to any claim such Director may have for damages for breach of any contract of service between him and the Company.    

123   
 
   The Directors may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director, provided that the appointment does not cause the number of Directors to exceed any number fixed by or in accordance with these articles as the maximum number of Directors.     

124   
 
 Subject to the requirements and restrictions contained in these articles (in particular, article 95), the Company may by Ordinary Resolution elect another person in place of a Director removed from office under article 122; and without prejudice to the powers of the Directors under article 123 the Company in general meeting may elect any person to be a Director either to fill a vacancy or (subject to not exceeding the Actual Board Size) an additional Director.    

 Officers 

125   
 
 The Board may elect a chairman of the Board and determine the period for which he is to hold office and may appoint any person (whether or not a Director) to fill the position of chief executive officer (who may be the same person as the chairman of the Board).  The chairman of the Board shall vacate that office if he vacates his office as a Director (otherwise than by the expiration of his term of office at a general meeting of the Company at which he is re-appointed).      

126   
 
 The Board may from time to time appoint one or more of its body to hold any office or position with the Company for such period and on such terms as the Board may determine and may revoke or terminate any such appointment.  Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for damages that such Director may have against the Company or the Company may have against such     

 33 
 28805560.1 

Director for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company that may be involved in such revocation or termination or otherwise.  Any person so appointed shall receive such remuneration, if any (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits or otherwise), as the Board may determine.     

127   
 
 In addition, the Board may appoint any person, whether or not he is a Director, to hold such executive or official position (except that of Auditor) as the Board may from time to time determine. The same person may hold more than one office or executive or official position.     

128   
 
   Any person elected or appointed pursuant to articles 125 to 127 (inclusive) shall hold his office or other position for such period and on such terms as the Board may determine and the Board may revoke or vary any such election or appointment at any time by resolution of the Board.  Any such revocation or variation shall be without prejudice to any claim for damages that such person may have against the Company or the Company may have against such person for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or variation.  If any such office or other position becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be filled by the Board.    

129   
 
   Except as provided in the Act or these articles, the powers and duties of any person elected or appointed to any office or executive or official position pursuant to articles 125 to 127 (inclusive) shall be such as are determined from time to time by the Board.    

130   
 
 The use or inclusion of the word  officer  (or similar words) in the title of any executive or other position shall not be deemed to imply that the person holding such executive or other position is an  officer  of the Company within the meaning of the Acts.    

131   
 
 The Secretary (including one or more deputy or Assistant Secretaries) shall be appointed by the Directors at such remuneration (if any) and upon such terms as it may think fit and any Secretary so appointed may be removed by the Directors.    

131.1   
 
 It shall be the duty of the Secretary to make and keep records of the votes, doings and proceedings of all meetings of the members and Board of the Company, and of its committees, and to authenticate records of the Company.    

131.2   
 
 A provision of the Acts or these articles requiring or authorising a thing to be done by or to a Director and the Secretary shall not be satisfied by its being done by or to the same person acting both as Director and as, or in place of, the Secretary.    

 Proceedings of Directors 

132.1   
 
 The Directors may meet together for the dispatch of business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings as they may think fit.  The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the Directors shall be a majority of the Directors in office at the time when the meeting is convened.  Questions arising at any meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. Each Director present and voting shall have one vote.    

132.2   
 
 Any Director may participate in a meeting of the Directors by means of telephonic or other similar communication whereby all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other speak, and participation in a meeting in this manner shall be deemed to constitute presence in person at such meeting and any Director may be situated in any part of the world for any such meeting.    

132.3   
 
 A meeting of the Directors or any committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is.    

 34 
 28805560.1 

133   
 
    The President or Chairman, as the case may be, or any four Directors, may, and the Secretary on the requisition of the President or Chairman, as the case may be, or any four Directors shall, at any time summon a meeting of the Directors.     

134   
 
   The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their number but, if and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors or Director may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number or of summoning a general meeting of the Company but for no other purpose.    

135   
 
 The Board may from time to time designate committees of the Board, with such powers and duties as the Board may decide to confer on such committees, and shall, for those committees and any others provided for herein, elect a Director or Directors to serve as the member or members, designating, if it desires, other Directors as alternate members who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.  Adequate provision shall be made for notice to members of all meetings of committees; a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum unless the committee shall consist of one or two members, in which event one member shall constitute a quorum; and all matters shall be determined by a majority vote of the members present.  Action may be taken by any committee without a meeting if all members thereof consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of such committees.    

136   
 
 A committee may elect a chairman of its meeting. If no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.    

137   
 
 All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director.    

138   
 
 Notwithstanding anything in these articles or in the Acts which might be construed as providing to the contrary, notice of every meeting of the Directors shall be given to all Directors either by mail not less than 48 hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone, email, or any other electronic means on not less than 24 hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate and which is reasonable in the circumstances.  Any Director may waive any notice required to be given under these articles, and the attendance of a Director at a meeting shall be deemed to be a waiver by such Director.    

139   
 
 A resolution or other document in writing (in electronic form or otherwise) signed (whether by electronic signature, advanced electronic signature or otherwise as approved by the Directors) by all the Directors entitled to receive notice of a meeting of Directors or of a committee of Directors shall be as valid as if it had been passed at a meeting of Directors or (as the case may be) a committee of Directors duly convened and held and may consist of several documents in the like form each signed by one or more Directors, and such resolution or other document or documents when duly signed may be delivered or transmitted (unless the Directors shall otherwise determine either generally or in any specific case) by facsimile transmission, electronic mail or some other similar means of transmitting the contents of documents.    

 Rights plan 

140   
 
 Subject to applicable law, the Board is hereby expressly authorised to adopt any shareholder rights plan or similar plan, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which, under circumstances provided therein, some or all Shareholders will have rights to acquire Shares or interests in Shares at a discounted price, upon such terms and conditions as the Board deems expedient and in the best interests of the Company.    

 The seal 

141   
 
 The Company, in accordance with article 104, may have for use in any territory outside Ireland one or more additional Seals, each of which shall be a duplicate of the Seal with or without the addition on its face of the name of one or more territories, districts or places where it is to be used and a securities seal as provided for in the Act.      

 35 
 28805560.1 

142   
 
      Any Authorised Person may affix the Seal of the Company over his signature alone to any document of the Company required to be authenticated or executed under Seal.  Subject to the Acts, any instrument to which a Seal is affixed shall be signed by one or more Authorised Persons.  As used in this article 142,  Authorised Person  means (i) any Director, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and (ii) any other person authorised for such purpose by the Board from time to time (whether, in the case of this clause (ii), identified individually or collectively and whether identified by name, title, function or such other criteria as the Board may determine).        

 Dividends and reserves 

143   
 
 The Company in general meeting may declare dividends, but no dividends shall exceed the amount recommended by the Directors.    

144   
 
 The Directors may from time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear to the Directors to be justified by the profits of the Company.    

145   
 
 No dividend or interim dividend shall be paid otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act.    

146   
 
 The Directors may, before recommending any dividend, set aside out of the profits of the Company such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied and pending such application may at the like discretion either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as the Directors may lawfully determine.  The Directors may also, without placing the same to reserve, carry forward any profits which they may think it prudent not to divide.    

147   
 
 Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to shares with special rights as to dividends, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid, but no amount paid or credited as paid on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of this article as paid on the share.  All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; but if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, such share shall rank for dividend accordingly.    

148   
 
 The Directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money (if any) immediately payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to the shares of the Company.    

149   
 
 Any general meeting declaring a dividend or bonus and any resolution of the Directors declaring an interim dividend may direct payment of such dividend, bonus or interim dividend wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stocks of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and the Directors shall give effect to such resolution, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any members upon the footing of the value so fixed, in order to adjust the rights of all the parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors.    

150   
 
 Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of any share may be paid by cheque or warrant sent by post, at the risk of the person or persons entitled thereto, to the registered address of the Holder or, where there are joint Holders, to the registered address of that one of the joint Holders who is first named on the members Register or to such person and to such address as the Holder or joint Holders may in writing direct.  Every such cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a good discharge to the Company.  Any joint Holder or other person jointly entitled to a share as aforesaid may give receipts for any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share.  Any such dividend or other distribution may also be paid by any other method (including payment in a currency other than US$, electronic funds transfer, direct debit, bank transfer or by means of a relevant system) which the Directors consider appropriate and any member who elects for such method of payment shall be deemed to have accepted all of the risks inherent therein.  The debiting of the Company's account in respect of the relevant amount shall be evidence of good discharge of the Company's obligations in respect of any payment made by any such methods.    

 36 
 28805560.1 

151   
 
    No dividend shall bear interest against the Company.     

152   
 
 If the Directors so resolve, any dividend which has remained unclaimed for six years from the date of its declaration shall be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment by the Directors of any unclaimed dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect thereof.    

 Accounting Records and Financial Statements 

153.1   
 
 The Directors shall, in accordance with Chapter 2 Part 6 of the Act, cause to be kept adequate accounting records, whether in the form of documents, electronic form or otherwise, that are sufficient to:    

(a)   
 
 correctly record and explain the transactions of the Company;    

(b)   
 
 enable, at any time, the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company to be determined with reasonable accuracy;    

(c)   
 
 enable the Directors to ensure that any financial statements of the Company, required to be prepared under section 290 or 293 of the Act, and any directors' report required to be prepared under section 325 of the Act, comply with the requirements of the Act and, where applicable, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and    

(d)   
 
 enable those financial statements of the Company so prepared to be audited.    

153.2   
 
 The accounting records shall be kept on a continuous and consistent basis, which is to say, the entries in them shall be made in a timely manner and be consistent from one period to the next. Adequate accounting records shall be deemed to have been maintained if they comply with the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the Act and explain the Company s transactions and facilitate the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company, and, if relevant, the group and include any information and returns referred to in Section 282(3) of the Act.    

153.3   
 
 The accounting records shall be kept at the Office or, subject to the provisions of the Act, at such other place as the Directors think fit and shall be open at all reasonable times to the inspection of the Directors.    

153.4   
 
 In accordance with the provisions of the Acts, the Directors shall cause to be prepared and to be laid before the annual general meeting of the Company from time to time such statutory financial statements of the Company and reports as are required by the Acts to be prepared and laid before such meeting.    

153.5   
 
 A copy of the statutory financial statements of the Company (including every document required by law to be annexed thereto) which is to be laid before the annual general meeting of the Company together with a copy of the Directors' report and Auditors' report, or, summary financial statements prepared in accordance with section 1119 of the Act, shall be sent by post, electronic mail or any other means of communication (electronic or otherwise), not less than 21 Clear Days before the date of the annual general meeting, to every person entitled under the provisions of the Acts to receive them; provided that in the case of those documents sent by electronic mail or any other means of electronic communication, such documents shall be sent with the consent of the recipient, to the address of the recipient notified to the Company by the recipient for such purposes; and provided, where the Directors elect to send summary financial statements to the members, any member may request that he be sent a copy of the statutory financial statements of the Company.    

 Capitalisation of profits 

154   
 
   The Directors may resolve to capitalise any part of the amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the Company's reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss account which is not available

All certificates or evidence of shares in book entry form representing the Company Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall hereinafter be referred to as the   Actavis Exchange Fund  .  After the Merger Effective Time, the Company caused the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder of record of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time represented outstanding Actavis Shares (the   Actavis Certificates   and to each Holder of record of non-certificated outstanding Actavis Shares represented by book entry (the   Actavis Book Entry Shares  ), which at the Merger Effective Time were converted into the right to receive, for each such Actavis Share, one Company Share (the   Merger Consideration  ):     

(a)   
 
 a letter of transmittal which specified that delivery would be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Actavis Certificates would pass, only upon delivery of the Actavis Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of the Actavis Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and     

(b)   
 
 instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Actavis Certificates and the Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable), in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor.    

158   
 
 Upon surrender of Actavis Certificates and / or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed  and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as were reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the Holder of such Actavis Certificates or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) was entitled to receive in exchange therefore (i) that number of Company Shares into which such Holder s Actavis shares represented by such Holder s properly surrendered Actavis Certificates or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) were converted pursuant to the Merger, and (ii) a cheque in an amount of US dollars equal to any cash dividends or other distributions that such Holder had a right to receive and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of any fractions of shares in the Company that such Holder had the     

 38 
 28805560.1 

right to receive pursuant to the Merger.  In the event of transfers of ownership of shares of Actavis common stock which were not registered in the transfer records of Actavis, the proper number of Company Shares were capable of being transferred to a person other than the person in whose name the Actavis Certificate or the Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) so surrendered were registered, if such Actavis Certificate or the Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) were properly endorsed or otherwise were in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such transfer paid any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the transfer of Company Shares to a person other than the registered Holder of such Actavis Certificate or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) or established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax was paid or was not applicable.  Any portion of the Actavis Exchange Fund which was not transferred to the Holders of the Actavis Certificates or the Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) as of the one year anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, was delivered to the Company or its designee, upon demand, and the Company Shares included therein were sold at the best price reasonably obtainable at that time.  Any Holder of Actavis Certificates or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) who has not complied with the applicable exchange procedures or duly completed and validly executed the applicable documents necessary to receive the Merger Consideration, prior to the one year anniversary of the Merger Effective Time shall now look only to the Company for payment of such Holder s claim for the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar applicable laws), such claim only being a claim for cash equal to the amount of monies received by the Company for sale of the Company Shares to which such Holder had been entitled pursuant to the Merger.

 28805560.1 

Winding up  

164   
 
 If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution among the members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up or credited as paid up share capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the members in proportion to the capital paid up or credited as paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them respectively.  And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution among the members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital paid up or credited as paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed among the members in proportion to the capital at the commencement of the winding up paid up or credited as paid up on the said shares held by them respectively.  Provided that this article shall not affect the rights of the Holders of shares issued upon special terms and conditions.    

165.1   
 
 In case of a sale by the liquidator under the Act, the liquidator may by the contract of sale agree so as to bind all the members for the allotment to the members directly of the proceeds of sale in proportion to their respective interests in the Company and may further by the contract limit a time at the expiration of which obligations or shares not accepted or required to be sold shall be deemed to have been irrevocably refused and be at the disposal of the Company, but so that nothing herein contained shall be taken to diminish, prejudice or affect the rights of dissenting members conferred by the said section.    

165.2   
 
 The power of sale of the liquidator shall include a power to sell wholly or partially for debentures, debenture stock, or other obligations of another company, either then already constituted or about to be constituted for the purpose of carrying out the sale.    

166   
 
 If the Company is wound up, the liquidator, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Acts, may divide among the members in specie or kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not), and, for such purpose, may value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of members. The liquidator, with the like sanction, may vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as, with the like sanction, he determines, but so that no member shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability.    

 Limitation on liability 

167   
 
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, no Director or officer of the Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its Shareholders for monetary damages for his or her acts or omissions save where such acts or omissions involve negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust.      

 Indemnity 

168.1   
 
 Subject to the provisions of and so far as may be admitted by the Acts, every Director and the Secretary of the Company shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company against all costs, charges, losses, expenses and liabilities incurred by him in the execution and discharge of his duties or in relation thereto including any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, civil or criminal, which relate to anything done or omitted or alleged to have been done or omitted by him as an officer or employee of the Company and in which judgment is given in his favour (or the proceedings are otherwise disposed of without any finding or admission of any material breach of duty on his part) or in which he is acquitted or in connection with any application under any statute for relief from liability in respect of any such act or omission in which relief is granted to him by the Court.    

168.2   
 
 The Directors shall have power to purchase and maintain for any Director, the Secretary or other employees of the Company insurance against any such liability as referred to in section 235 of the Act.    

 41 
 28805560.1 

168.3   
 
    As far as is permissible under the Act  s  , the Company shall indemnify any current or former executive officer of the Company (excluding any present or former Directors of the Company or Secretary of the Company), or any person who is serving or has served at the request of the Company as a   D  irector or executive officer of another company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including any Company subsidiary (each individually, a "  Covered Person  "), against any expenses, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to which he or she was, is, or is threatened to be made a party, or is otherwise involved (a "  proceeding  "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Covered Person; provided, however, that this provision shall not indemnify any Covered Person against any liability arising out of (a) any fraud or dishonesty in the performance of such Covered Person's duty to the Company, or (b) such Covered Party's conscious, intentional or wilful breach of the obligation to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company.      Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this section shall not extend to any matter which would render it void pursuant to the Act  s   or to any person holding the office of auditor in relation to the Company.     

168.4   
 
 In the case of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the name of the Company, the Company shall indemnify each Covered Person against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defence or the settlement thereof, except no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for fraud or dishonesty in the performance of his or her duty to the Company, or for conscious, intentional or wilful breach of his or her obligation to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company, unless and only to the extent that the High Court of Ireland or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such Covered Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this section shall not extend to any matter which would render it void pursuant to the Acts or to any person holding the office of Auditor in relation to the Company.    

168.5   
 
 Any indemnification under this article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorised in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this article.  Such determination shall be made by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Company.  To the extent, however, that any Covered Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defence of any proceeding, or in defence of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Covered Person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without necessity of authorisation in the specific case.    

168.6   
 
 As far as permissible under the Acts, expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in defending any proceeding for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to this article shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt by the Board of an undertaking by the particular indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company pursuant to these articles.    

168.7   
 
 It being the policy of the Company that indemnification of the persons specified in this article shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law, the indemnification provided by this article shall not be deemed exclusive (i) of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under these articles, any agreement, any insurance purchased by the Company, vote of members or disinterested Directors, or pursuant to the direction (however embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, or (ii) of the power of the Company to indemnify any person who is or was an employee or agent of the Company or of another company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise which he or she is serving or has served at the request of the Company, to the same extent and in the same situations and subject to the same determinations as are hereinabove set forth.  As used in this article, references to the "Company" include all constituent companies in a consolidation or merger in which the Company or a predecessor to the Company by consolidation or merger was involved.     

 42 
 28805560.1 

The indemnification provided by this article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Covered Person and shall inure to the benefit of their heirs, executors, and administrators.     

 Untraced Holders 

169.1   
 
   The Company shall be entitled to sell at the best price reasonably obtainable any share of a member or any share to which a person is entitled by transmission if and provided that:    

(a)   
 
 for a period of six years (not less than three dividends having been declared and paid) no cheque or warrant sent by the Company through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to the member or to the person entitled by transmission to the share or stock at his address on the Register or other the last known address given by the member or the person entitled by transmission to which cheques and warrants are to be sent has been cashed and no communication has been received by the Company from the member or the person entitled by transmission;     

(b)   
 
 at the expiration of the said period of six years the Company has given notice by advertisement in a leading Dublin newspaper and a newspaper circulating in the area in which the address referred to in article 169.1(a) is located of its intention to sell such share or stock;    

(c)   
 
 the Company has not during the further period of three months after the date of the advertisement and prior to the exercise of the power of sale received any communication from the member or person entitled by transmission; and    

(d)   
 
 if so required by the rules of any securities exchange upon which the shares in question are listed, notice has been given to that exchange of the Company's intention to make such sale.    

169.2   
 
   To the extent necessary in order to comply with any laws or regulations to which the Company is subject in relation to escheatment, abandonment of property or other similar or analogous laws or regulations (  Applicable Escheatment Laws  ), the Company may deal with any share of any member and any unclaimed cash payments relating to such share in any manner which it sees fit, including (but not limited to) transferring or selling such share and transferring to third parties any unclaimed cash payments relating to such share.    

169.3   
 
 The Company may only exercise the powers granted to it in this article 169 in circumstances where it has complied with, or procured compliance with, the required procedures (as set out in Applicable Escheatment Laws) with respect to attempting to identify and locate the relevant member of the Company.    

169.4   
 
 If during any six year period referred to in article 169.1, further shares have been issued in right of those held at the beginning of such period or of any previously issued during such period and all the other requirements of this article (other than the requirement that they be in issue for six years) have been satisfied in regard to the further shares, the Company may also sell the further shares.    

169.5   
 
 To give effect to any such sale the Company may appoint any person to execute as transferor an instrument of transfer of such share and such instrument of transfer shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the registered Holder of or person entitled by transmission to such share.    

169.6   
 
 The Company shall account to the member or other person entitled to such share for the net proceeds of such sale by carrying all moneys in respect thereof to a separate account which shall be a permanent debt of the Company and the Company shall be deemed to be a debtor and not a trustee in respect thereof for such member or other person. Monies carried to such separate account may either be employed in the business of the Company or invested in such investments (other than shares of the Company or its holding company if any) as the Directors may from time to time think fit.
