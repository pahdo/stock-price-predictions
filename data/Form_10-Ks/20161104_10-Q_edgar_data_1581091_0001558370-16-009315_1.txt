1. Business and Organizat  ion 

RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. ( RE/MAX Holdings ) was formed as a Delaware corporation on June 25, 2013 and was capitalized on July 8, 2013. On October 7, 2013, RE/MAX Holdings completed an initial public offering (the  IPO ) of 11,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. A portion of the proceeds received by RE/MAX Holdings from the IPO was used to acquire the net business assets of HBN, Inc. ( HBN ) and Tails, Inc. ( Tails ) in the Southwest and Central Atlantic regions of the United States ( U.S. ), respectively, which were subsequently contributed to RMCO, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries ( RMCO ), and the remaining proceeds were used to purchase common membership units in RMCO.  

After completion of the IPO, RE/MAX Holdings owned 39.56% of the common membership units in RMCO. During the fourth quarter of 2015, RIHI, Inc. ( RIHI ) redeemed 5,175,000 common units in RMCO in exchange for newly issued shares of RE/MAX Holdings  Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Immediately upon redemption, RIHI sold its 5,175,000 shares of Class A common stock at $36.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions (the  Secondary Offering ). As of September 30, 2016, RE/MAX Holdings owns 58.42% of the common membership units in RMCO. RE/MAX Holdings  only business is to act as the sole manager of RMCO.  RE/MAX Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, including RMCO, are referred to hereinafter as the  Company.  

The Company is one of the leading franchisors of residential and commercial real estate brokerage services throughout the U.S. and globally.  The Company, as a franchisor, grants each broker-owner a license to use the RE/MAX brand, trademark, promotional and operating materials and concepts.  Through 2015, the Company operated a small number of real estate brokerage offices in the U.S.  As discussed in Note 5,   Acquisitions and Dispositions  , the Company sold certain operating assets and liabilities of these brokerage offices during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 and, subsequent thereto, no longer operates any real estate brokerage offices and no longer recognizes brokerage revenue (which consisted of fees assessed by the Company s previously owned brokerages for services provided to their affiliated real estate agents).  Beginning in October 2016, the Compay also franchises mortgage brokerages under the  Motto Mortgage  brand, and in connection with launching this business, on September 12, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Full House Mortgage Connection, Inc. ( Full House ).  See Note 5,   Acquisitions and Dispositions  , for further detail.   

The Company s revenue is derived as follows:  

Continuing franchise fees which consist of fixed contractual fees paid monthly by regional franchise owners and franchisees based on the number of agents in the respective franchised region or office.      

Annual dues from agents.      

Broker fees which consist of fees paid by regional franchise owners and franchisees for real estate commissions paid by customers when an agent sells a home.     

Franchise sales and other franchise revenue which consist of fees from initial sales and renewals of franchises, regional franchise fees, preferred marketing arrangements, approved supplier programs and event-based revenue from training and other programs.      

Brokerage revenue prior to the sale of the Company s brokerage offices during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.       

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and with Article

Table of Contents  

RE/MAX HOLDINGS, INC. 

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

(Unaudited) 

10 of Regulation S-X. In compliance with those instructions, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of RE/MAX Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the results of its operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, changes in its stockholders  equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and results of its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Interim results may not be indicative of full year performance. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements within the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas in which management uses assumptions include, among other things, the establishment of the allowance for doubtful trade accounts and notes receivable, the determination of the estimated lives of intangible assets, the estimates for amounts accrued for litigation matters, the estimates for determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the estimates related to the accounting for income taxes, the estimates of the fair value of reporting units used in the annual assessment of goodwill, and the amounts due to RIHI and Oberndorf Investments LLC ( Oberndorf ) pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreements ( TRAs ) discussed in more detail in Note 3,   Non-controlling Interest  . Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Reclassifications 

In conjunction with the adoption of several recent accounting pronouncements, certain items in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation.  These reclassifications did not affect the Company s consolidated results of operations.  

Segment Reporting 

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company began to operate in one reportable segment, Real Estate Franchise Services.  All prior segment information has been reclassified to reflect the Company s new segment structure.  Prior to 2016, the Company operated in two reportable segments, (1) Real Estate Franchise Services and (2) Brokerages. The Real Estate Franchise Services reportable segment comprised the operations of the Company s owned and independent global franchising operations under the RE/MAX brand name, intersegment revenue from the Company s previously owned brokerages and corporate-wide professional services expenses. The Brokerages reportable segment contained the operations of the Company s previously owned brokerage offices in the U.S., the results of operations of a mortgage brokerage company in which the Company previously owned a non-controlling interest and reflected the elimination of intersegment revenue and other consolidation entries. During 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold its 21 previously owned brokerage offices, as discussed in Note 5,   Acquisitions and Dispositions  . These dispositions resulted in the cessation of operations for the Company s Brokerages reportable segment.

Principles of Consolidation  

As of September 30, 2016, RE/MAX Holdings owns 58.42% of the common membership units in RMCO and, as its managing member, RE/MAX Holdings controls RMCO s operations, management and activities. As a result, RE/MAX Holdings consolidates RMCO and records a non-controlling interest in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and records net income attributable to the non-controlling interest and comprehensive income attributable to the non-controlling interest in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, respectively.  

Emerging Growth Company Status  

Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act ), the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company. The Company irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act and the Company has not been subject to the requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( SOX ). The Company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of the end of 2016.  Therefore, pursuant to Section 404(b) of SOX, the Company will be required to include an opinion from an independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.    

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies classification for certain cash receipts and cash payments on the consolidated statement of cash flow.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual reporting period. The standard requires a retrospective transition method for each period presented. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, statutory tax withholding requirements, forfeitures and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual reporting period. The standard requires the guidance related to forfeitures and the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method, the guidance related to the accounting for income taxes to be applied prospectively, and the guidance related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2016 and elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.  As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $44,000 to  Retained earnings  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statement of Stockholders  Equity.  Furthermore, the Company elected to apply the retrospective transition method to the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statements of cash flows.  This resulted in an increase in cash flows provided by operating activities of $2,411,000 and a net increase of $2,411,000 in cash flows used in financing activities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a $201,000 income tax benefit relating to the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units in  Provision for income taxes  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Prior to 2016, such excess tax benefits were recorded in  Additional paid-in capital  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases on the consolidated balance sheets. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual reporting period. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or prospective transition method and permits early adoption as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company elected to early adopt this standard retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016 and $3,332,000 previously presented in  Other current assets  was reclassified to  Deferred tax assets, net  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and related disclosures as of December 31, 2015, but the Company s consolidated results of operations were not affected. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which eliminates the requirement for an entity to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is completed. ASU 2015-16 became effective prospectively for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10,   Technical Corrections and Improvements  , which both clarifies and simplifies content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and corrects unintended application of U.S. GAAP. ASU 2015-10 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Intangibles       Goodwill and Other       Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  , which provides guidance on fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement and clarifies the accounting for a software license element of a cloud computing arrangement. ASU 2015-05 became effective prospectively for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest   (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective retrospectively for the Company on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard resulted in $1,527,000 of net debt issuance costs previously reported as  Debt issuance costs, net  to be reclassified to  Debt, net of current portion    in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   and related disclosures as of December 31, 2015, but did not affect the Company s consolidated results of operations.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In   August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 by one year.   In   April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which provides clarification on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.    In   May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which provides clarification on assessing

collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition.    These standards are effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within such annual reporting periods.   The standard   permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

3. Non-controlling Interest 

RE/MAX Holdings is the sole managing member of RMCO and subsequent to the IPO, began to operate and control all of the business affairs of RMCO. As a result, RE/MAX Holdings began to consolidate RMCO on October 7, 2013, and because RE/MAX Holdings and RMCO are entities under common control, such consolidation has been reflected for all periods presented.  RE/MAX Holdings owns a 58.42% and 58.33% economic interest in RMCO as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and records a non-controlling interest for the remaining 41.58% and 41.67% economic interest in RMCO held by RIHI as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  RE/MAX Holdings  economic interest in RMCO increased due to an increase in common units, which were issued concurrently with the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon the exercise of 28,057 stock options and the vesting of 33,288 restricted stock units, net of shares withheld, as discussed in Note 10,   Equity-Based Compensation  .  RE/MAX Holdings  only sources of cash flow from operations are distributions from RMCO and management fees received pursuant to the management services agreement between RE/MAX Holdings and RMCO.  Net income attributable to non-controlling interest  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in RMCO held by the non-controlling unitholders. As of October 7, 2013,  Non-controlling interest  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represented the carryover basis of RIHI s capital account in RMCO. Subsequent thereto, the non-controlling interest balance has been and will continue to be adjusted to reflect tax and other cash distributions made to, and the income allocated to, the non-controlling unitholders, as well as future redemptions of common units in RMCO pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement ( RMCO, LLC Agreement ). The ownership of the common units in RMCO is summarized as follows:

(Unaudited) 

The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to calculate the net income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings.

A reconciliation of the  Provision for income taxes  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the periods indicated is detailed as follows (in thousands):  

(a) 

The provision for income taxes attributable to RE/MAX Holdings includes all U.S. federal and state income taxes as well as RE/MAX Holdings  proportionate share of the net assets of RMCO of the taxes imposed directly on RE/MAX, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries ( RE/MAX, LLC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RMCO, related primarily to tax liabilities in certain foreign jurisdictions of $537,000 and $346,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1,365,000 and $924,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      

(b) 

The provision for income taxes attributable to entities other than RE/MAX Holdings represents taxes imposed directly on RE/MAX, LLC related to tax liabilities primarily in certain foreign jurisdictions that are allocated to the non-controlling interest.     

Distributions and Other Payments to Non-controlling Unitholders  

As a limited liability company (treated as a partnership for income tax purposes), RMCO does not incur significant federal, state or local income taxes, as these taxes are primarily the obligations of its members.     As authorized by the RMCO, LLC Agreement, RMCO makes cash distributions to non-controlling unitholders.  Discretionary cash distributions may be made to non-controlling unitholders based on their ownership percentage in RMCO as determined in accordance with the RMCO, LLC Agreement.  These discretionary distributions are paid on a quarterly basis equal to the dividend payments to the stockholders of the Company s Class A common stock or otherwise on a discretionary

basis as necessary.  In addition, RMCO is generally required to distribute cash on a pro-rata basis to its members to the extent necessary to cover each member s estimated tax liabilities, if any, with respect to their allocable share of RMCO earnings, but only to the extent that any other discretionary distributions from RMCO for the relevant period were otherwise insufficient to enable each member to cover its estimated tax liabilities.  Upon completion of its tax returns with respect to the prior year, RMCO may make other discretionary true-up distributions to its members, if cash is available for such purposes, with respect to actual taxable income for the prior year. 

The distributions paid or payable to or on behalf of non-controlling unitholders under the RMCO, LLC Agreement are summarized as follows:  

The dividend distributions are discussed further in Note 4,   Earnings Per Share and Dividends  .  The tax and other discretionary distributions are recorded in  Non-controlling interest  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Stockholders  Equity and the paid portion is reported in  Distributions paid to non-controlling unitholders  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

On November 3, 2016, the Company declared a distribution to non-controlling unitholders of $1,884,000, which is payable on December 1, 2016.  

Payments Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements  

At the time of the IPO, RE/MAX Holdings entered into separate TRAs with RMCO s historical owners, RIHI and Weston Presidio V, L.P. ( Weston Presidio ). During the second quarter of 2015, Weston Presidio assigned, transferred and conveyed to Oberndorf all of its rights, title and interest in and to, and all of its liabilities and obligations under, the TRA dated as of October 7, 2013 by and between RE/MAX Holdings and Weston Presidio. In connection therewith, the Company entered into a joinder to the TRA on May 29, 2015 with Western Presidio and Oberndorf (the  Joinder Agreement ). Neither the assignment and transfer nor the Joinder Agreement impacted the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company reflected a liability of $98,782,000, representing the payments due to RIHI and Oberndorf, under the terms of the TRAs (see current and non-current portion of  Payable pursuant to tax receivable agreements  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets).   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company estimates that amounts payable pursuant to the TRAs within the next 12-month period will be approximately $7,225,000, of which $2,591,000 is related to RE/MAX Holdings  2014 federal and state tax returns and the remainder is related to RE/MAX Holdings  2015 federal and state tax returns. To determine the current amount of the payments due to RIHI and Oberndorf, the Company estimated the amount of taxable income that RE/MAX Holdings generated during 2015 and 2014 and the amount of the specified deductions subject to the TRAs which were realized by RE/MAX Holdings in its 2015 and 2014 federal and state tax returns. This amount was then used as a basis for determining the Company s increase in estimated tax cash savings as a result of such deductions on which a current TRA obligation became due (i.e. payable within 12 months of the Company s year-end). These calculations are performed pursuant to the terms of the TRAs. The Company paid $1,344,000 and $0 pursuant to the terms of the TRAs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(Unaudited) 

The timing and amount of the payments to be made under the TRAs are subject to certain contingencies, including RE/MAX Holdings having sufficient taxable income to utilize all of the tax benefits defined in the TRAs. If the Company elects to terminate the TRAs early, the Company would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the TRAs, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits.  

Obligations pursuant to the TRAs are obligations of RE/MAX Holdings. They do not impact the non-controlling interest. These obligations are not income tax obligations and have no impact on the  Provision for income taxes  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. In general, items of income, gain, loss and deduction are allocated on the basis of the members  ownership interests pursuant to the RMCO, LLC Agreement after taking into consideration all relevant sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  

4. Earnings Per Share and Dividends 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) measures the performance of an entity over the reporting period. Diluted EPS measures the performance of an entity over the reporting period while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period. The treasury stock method is used to determine the dilutive potential of stock options and restricted stock units.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations (in thousands, except share and per share information):  

There were no anti-dilutive shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The one share of Class B common stock outstanding does not share in the earnings of RE/MAX Holdings and is therefore not a participating security. Accordingly, basic and diluted net income per share of Class B common stock has not been presented.

Acquisitions 

Full House Mortgage Connection, Inc. 

Motto Franchising, LLC ( Motto ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RE/MAX, LLC, was formed and developed to franchise mortgage brokerages.    On September 12, 2016, Motto acquired certain assets of Full House, a franchisor of mortgage brokerages that created the concept behind Motto.    Motto, as a franchisor, grants each franchisee a license to use the Motto Mortgage brand, trademark, promotional and operating materials and  concepts.    The Company used $8,000,000 in cash generated from operations to initially fund the acquisition.  Additional cash consideration may be required based on future revenues generated, as discussed below.  The   assets acquired constitute a business and were accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method.  The total purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated acquisition date fair values.  The excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.  The goodwill recognized for Full House is attributable to expected synergies and projected long term revenue growth.  All of the goodwill recognized is tax deductible.   

Consideration 

The following table summarizes the estimated consideration transferred at the acquisition (in thousands): 

The Company is required to pay additional purchase consideration totaling eight percent of gross revenues generated by the acquired business each year for the next ten years with no limitation as to the maximum payout.  The consideration is payable following each anniversary, beginning October 1, 2017 and ending September 30, 2026.  The acquisition date fair value of the contingent purchase consideration of $6,300,000 represents the forecasted discounted cash payments that the Company expects to pay the former owner of Full House with respect to the acquired business. The cash flows were discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.  The Company will re-measure this liability each reporting period

On March 11, 2015, the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility was amended, providing for an increase to the maximum applicable margin for both London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) and Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) loans by 0.25%, and a modification of certain liquidity covenants in order to increase the amounts the Company may distribute in the form of dividends to its non-controlling unitholders and stockholders of its Class A common stock, referred to herein as the  First Amendment.  Interest rates with respect to the amended term loan facility and revolving loan facility are based, at the Company s option, on (a) adjusted LIBOR, provided that LIBOR shall be no less than 1% plus a maximum applicable margin of 3.25% or (b) ABR, provided that ABR shall be no less than 2%, which is equal to the greater of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. s prime rate; (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% or (3) calculated Eurodollar Rate for a one month interest period plus 1%, plus a maximum applicable margin of 2.25%.  The applicable margin is subject to quarterly adjustments based on the Company s total leverage ratio as defined in the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility. In connection with the First Amendment, the Company incurred costs of $1,086,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 of which $555,000 was recorded as an unamortized debt discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the remaining $531,000 was expensed as incurred.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company made an excess cash flow prepayment of $7,320,000. The Company accounted for the mandatory principal excess cash flow prepayments as early extinguishments of debt and recorded a loss of $136,000 and $94,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to unamortized debt discount and issuance costs. The Company may make optional prepayments on the term loan facility at any time; however, no such optional prepayments were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

As a result, the Company has classified the fair value of the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts of the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility are included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in  Current portion of debt  and  Debt, net of current portion.

Contingencies 

In connection with the Purchase of Full House, as described in Note 5,   Acquisitions and Dispositions  , the Company entered into an arrangement to pay additional purchase consideration based on Motto s future gross revenues over the next ten years.  As of September 30, 2016, this liability was estimated to be $6,300,000 and is recorded in  Other liabilities, net of current portion  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

In connection with the sale of the assets and liabilities related to the Company s previously owned brokerages as described in Note 5,   Acquisitions and     Dispositions  , the Company entered into three Assignment and Assumption of Lease Agreements (the  Assignment Agreements ) pursuant to which the Company assigned its obligations under and rights, title and interest in 21 leases to the respective purchasers. For certain leases, the Company remains secondarily liable for future lease payments over approximately the next 58-month period under the respective lease agreements and accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, the Company has outstanding lease guarantees of $6,953,000. This amount represents the maximum potential amount of future payments under the respective lease guarantees. In the event of default by the purchaser, the indemnity and default clauses in the Assignment Agreements govern the Company s ability to pursue and recover damages incurred, if any, against the purchaser. As of September 30, 2016, the likelihood of default by the purchaser on one of the Assignment Agreements was deemed to be reasonably possible and as such, the Company recognized a loss of $  243,000   in  (Gain) loss on sale or disposition of assets, net  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the short-term portion of the liability was $49,000 and is included in  Accrued liabilities  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The long-term portion of the liability was $163,000 and is recorded in  Other liabilities, net of current portion  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Litigation  

The Company is subject to litigation claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has adequately accrued for legal matters as appropriate. The Company records litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable and for related legal costs as incurred. The Company does not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries and any insurance recoveries are recorded in  Accounts and notes receivable, current portion  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reduction to  Selling, operating and administrative expenses  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

In connection with the IPO effective October 7, 2013, RE/MAX Holdings acquired the net assets, excluding cash, of HBN and Tails for consideration paid of $7,130,000 and $20,175,000, respectively. Regarding the acquisition of the net assets of HBN, several shareholders of HBN (the  Defendants ) dissented from the transaction and demanded payment for their shares in excess of consideration paid. Pursuant to the dissenters  rights statute in the State of Colorado, HBN petitioned the District Court of Denver County, Colorado (the  Court ) to determine the fair value of HBN.  The Court rendered a decision on December 28, 2015 and concluded that the fair value of HBN on October 7, 2013 was higher than the amount paid. Accordingly, the Court awarded the Defendants $3,153,000, which represents the amount of the Defendants  share of HBN s fair value as determined by the Court in excess of the consideration paid, as well as accrued interest from October 7, 2013 through the date of judgment. In addition,   the Court s decision provides for the payment of certain costs incurred in connection with the litigation and additional interest from the judgment date until the payment date.    As a result of this conclusion, the Company recorded an accrual of $3,251,000 as of December 31, 2015,   which was paid on February 2, 2016.   

In connection with the Company s acquisition of the net assets of Tails, several shareholders of Tails challenged the terms of the transaction and filed a shareholder action entitled Robert B. Fisher, Carla L. Fisher, Bradley G. Rhodes and James D. Schwartz v. Tails, Inc. in the Circuit Court of Henrico County, Virginia ("Tails I"). The Court dismissed Tails I on December 23, 2013. The shareholders appealed that decision. On January 8, 2015, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of Tails I.  On March 7, 2016, the same Tails I plaintiffs filed a shareholder derivative complaint and complaint for individual claims entitled Robert B. Fisher, Carla L. Fisher, Bradley G. Rhodes

and James D. Schwartz v. Gail Liniger, Dave Liniger, Bruce Benham, RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. and Tails Holdco, Inc. in Denver District Court ("Tails II"). The Tails II defendants, including the Company, filed a motion to dismiss the Tails II complaint in its entirety on April 15, 2016.  On July 26, 2016, the Denver District Court dismissed all of the Tails II plaintiffs  shareholder derivative claims.  The Court did not dismiss the Tails II plaintiffs  individual claims seeking $384,000 in total for interest allegedly owed.  On August 24, 2016, the Plaintiffs moved to amend their Complaint to add additional individual claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty.  The Tails II defendants intend to vigorously defend their position that the Tails II plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought.  The Company believes a range for the potential impact to its financial position and results of operation is not determinable as of September 30, 2016.  Accordingly, the Company currently has not recorded an accrual in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

Except for the ongoing litigation concerning the acquisition of the net assets of Tails, management of the Company believes other such litigation matters involving a reasonably possible chance of loss will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

13. Related-Party Transactions  

The Company s previously owned real estate brokerage operations paid advertising fees to regional and national advertising funds, which promote the RE/MAX brand. These advertising funds are corporations owned by a majority stockholder of RIHI, who is also the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder. This individual does not receive any compensation from these corporations, as all funds received by the corporations are, as a result of contractual commitments in our franchise agreements, required to be spent on advertising for the respective regions. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s previously owned real estate brokerage operations paid $210,000 to these advertising funds.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s previously owned real estate brokerage operations paid $11,000 and $705,000, respectively, to these advertising funds.  These payments are included in  Selling, operating and administrative expenses  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  

The majority stockholders of RIHI, including the Company s current Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder have made and continue to make a golf course they own available to the Company for business purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company used the golf course for business purposes at minimal charge.  

The Company provides services, such as accounting, legal, marketing, technology, human resources and public relations services, to certain affiliated entities, and it allows these companies to share its leased office space. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total amounts allocated for services rendered and rent for office space provided on behalf of affiliated entities were $507,000 and $446,000, respectively. During the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total amounts allocated for services rendered and rent for office space provided on behalf of affiliated entities were $1,459,000 and $1,293,000 respectively. Such amounts are generally paid within 30 days and no such amounts were outstanding at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  In addition, affiliated regional franchisors have current outstanding continuing franchise fees, broker fees and franchise sales revenue amounts due from the Company of $35,000 and $66,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Such amounts are included in  Accounts payable to affiliates  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The results of operations discussed in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  are those of RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. ( RE/MAX Holdings ) and its consolidated subsidiaries, including RMCO, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries ( RMCO ), collectively, the  Company,   we,   our  or  us.  

Business Overview  

We are one of the world s leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services. Our business strategy is to recruit and retain real estate professionals and sell franchises. As of September 30, 2016, our franchisees operate under the RE/MAX brand name which has held the number one market share in the U.S. and Canada since 1999 as measured by total residential transaction sides completed by our agents.  

Historically, our financial results are driven by the number of agents in our global network. The majority of our revenue is derived from fixed, contractual fees and dues paid to us based on the number of agents in our franchise network.  

Our current growth strategies include the following initiatives:  

Capitalize on the gradual improvement in the U.S. residential real estate market and increase our total agent count;      

Continue to drive franchise sales growth and agent recruitment and retention;     

Reacquire select RE/MAX regional franchises in the U.S. and Canada;     

Grow our recently introduced mortgage franchise business, Motto Mortgage; and     

Reinvest in the business to create more profitable brokerages, more productive agents, and an enhanced consumer experience with the RE/MAX brand.     

As a franchisor, we maintain a low fixed-cost structure which enables us to generate high margins and helps us drive significant operating leverage through incremental revenue growth as reflected in our financial results.  

During the first quarter of 2016, we began to operate in one reportable segment, Real Estate Franchise Services. Prior to 2016, we operated in two reportable segments, (1) Real Estate Franchise Services and (2) Brokerages. The Real Estate Franchise Services reportable segment comprised the operations of our owned and independent global franchising operations under the RE/MAX brand name, intersegment revenue from our previously owned brokerages and corporate-wide professional services expenses. The Brokerages reportable segment contained the operations of our previously owned brokerage offices in the U.S., the results of operations of a mortgage brokerage company in which we previously owned a non-controlling interest and reflected the elimination of intersegment revenue and other consolidation entries.  As of January 1, 2015, we owned 21 brokerages (which represented less than 1% of RE/MAX total brokerages in the U.S.).  However, during 2015, we sold 18 brokerage offices and in January 2016, we sold the remaining three offices.  These dispositions resulted in the cessation of operations for our Brokerages reportable segment.  

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business  

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results, including agent count, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.  

30 

Table of Contents  

Agent Count  . Agent count reflects the number of licensed agents who have active, independent contractual relationships with RE/MAX offices at a particular time. The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring fixed fee streams we receive from our franchisees and agents that are tied to our aggregate agent count.  We also consider the breakdown of agent count in Company-owned Regions in the United States and Canada versus Independent Regions in the United States and Canada and elsewhere, because our average annual revenue per agent for our Company-owned Regions in the United States and Canada is nearly three times greater than for Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada and revenue per agent for regions outside the U.S. and Canada is even lower.  

The following table shows our agent count at the end of the periods indicated:  

(1) 

As of each quarter end since June 30, 2016, U.S. Company-owned Regions include agents in the Alaska region, which converted from an Independent Region to a Company-owned Region in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of RE/MAX of Alaska, Inc. ( RE/MAX of Alaska ), including the regional franchise agreements issued by us permitting the sale of RE/MAX franchises in the state of Alaska, on April 1, 2016.  As of the acquisition date, the Alaska region had 245 agents.  In addition, as of each quarter end since March 31, 2016, U.S. Company-owned Regions include agents in the New York region, which converted from an Independent Region to a Company-owned Region in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of RE/MAX of New York, Inc. ( RE/MAX of New York ), including the regional franchise agreements issued by us permitting the sale of RE/MAX franchises in the state of New York, on February 22, 2016.  As of the acquisition date, the New York region had 869 agents.       

(2) 

As of each quarter end since March 31, 2015, Independent Regions outside of the U.S. and Canada include agents in the Caribbean and Central America regions, which converted from Company-owned Regions to Independent Regions in connection with the regional franchising agreements we entered into with new independent owners of the Caribbean and Central America regions on January 1, 2015.  As of the disposition date, the Caribbean and Central America regions had 328 agents.       

Revenue  .  The majority of our revenue is derived from operations in the U.S. and Canada.  In connection with our revenue analysis, we consider the breakdown of agent count in the U.S. and Canada versus regions outside the U.S. and Canada as our average annual revenue per agent in the U.S. and Canada is greater than for regions outside the U.S. and Canada.   

31 

Table of Contents  

The following table shows revenue and agent count by geography on a consolidated basis: 

The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring, fixed contractual fees derived from continuing franchise fees (which consist of fees paid monthly by regional franchise owners and franchisees based on the number of agents in the respective franchised region or office) as well as annual dues from agents.  A smaller percentage of our revenue is based on transaction activity derived from broker fees (which consist of fees paid by regional franchise owners and franchisees for real estate commissions earned when an agent sells a home).  The remaining portion of our revenue is derived from franchise sales and other franchise revenue (which consist of fees from initial sales and renewals of franchises, regional franchise fees, preferred marketing arrangements, approved supplier programs and event-based revenue from training and other programs) and, prior to the sale of the our brokerage offices during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, brokerage revenue.  

The following table shows revenue by transaction type on a consolidated basis:   

The increase in the percentage of our recurring fixed fee revenue (i.e. continuing franchise fees and annual dues) and transaction based revenue (i.e. broker fees) is primarily related to the divestitures of our previously owned brokerages and secondarily the result of our organic agent count growth.   

Adjusted EBITDA  . We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of our business. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. See   Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and for further discussion of our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most comparable GAAP measure for operating performance.  Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.  

The following table shows our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins on a consolidated basis:  

32 

Table of Contents  

We generally experience lower Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year primarily due to lower home sale transactions in the residential housing market in the U.S. and Canada, which result in lower broker fee revenue recognized during these quarters. In addition, generally, our margins in the first quarter are lower because of higher selling, operating and administrative expenses incurred in connection with our annual convention. 

The following table shows this seasonality in our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins on a consolidated basis:  

As discussed elsewhere in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  our real estate brokerage operations ceased during January 2016, at which point we began operating in one reportable segment. We no longer incur fixed costs associated with our previously owned brokerage offices and will receive ongoing monthly continuing franchise fees, broker fees and franchise sales revenue from the 21 brokerage offices that we sold in 2015 and 2016.  

Significant Transactions and Factors Affecting Our Consolidated Operating Results  

Various factors affected our results for the periods presented in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  including the following:  

Changes in Agent Count  .    The majority of our revenue is derived from fees and dues based on the number of agents in the RE/MAX network. Due to the low fixed cost structure of our franchise model, the addition of new agents generally requires nominal incremental investment in capital or infrastructure. Accordingly, the number of agents in our network (particularly in our Company-owned Regions in the U.S. and Canada) is the most important factor affecting our results of operations and the addition of new agents can favorably impact our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Historically, the number of agents in the residential real estate industry has been highly correlated with overall home sale transaction activity. Our agent count decreased during the downturn in the U.S. housing sector, but has returned to growth as the markets have improved. However, we do not use our overall home sale transaction activity on a per agent or aggregate basis in order to evaluate our results of operations. We believe that the number of agents in our network is the primary statistic that drives our revenue. 

Changes in Aggregate Fee Revenue Per Agent  .    A significant portion of our revenue is tied to various fees that are ultimately tied to the number of agents in our franchise system, including annual dues, continuing franchise fees and certain transaction or service-based fees. Our average annual revenue per agent for our Company-owned Regions in the U.S. and Canada is nearly three times greater than for Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada. Our average revenue per agent in regions outside of the U.S. and Canada is substantially lower than the average revenue per agent in the U.S. and Canada. We have expanded our owned regional franchising operations through acquisitions of Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada, and intend to pursue reacquisitions of other regions in the future.  

33 

Table of Contents  

In addition, other changes in our aggregate revenue per agent are derived from changes in our fee arrangements, which can take the form of fee waivers or fee deferrals, with our franchisees and agents over time.  We implemented Momentum       , a comprehensive training, development and recruiting program for the broker owners in our network (the  Momentum Program ), which is specifically designed to educate our broker owners on how to manage their businesses more effectively and profitably, as well as plan for future business growth. We provide certain fee waivers in order to incentivize our broker owners to participate in the program, which in turn impacts the comparability of our results of operations. We expect to continue the Momentum Program in the future. Our revenue per agent also increases in other ways, including when transaction sides and sales volume increases. This is because a portion of our revenue comes from fees tied to the number and sales price of real estate transactions closed by the agents in our network. Due to the low fixed cost structure of our franchise model, modest increases in revenue per agent impact the comparability of our operating results.  Beginning July 1, 2016, we implemented a $5.00 and $2.50 per month per agent increase in continuing franchise fees in our Company-owned Regions in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, which will impact the comparability of our future operating results. Subsequent thereto, we will evaluate the appropriateness of inflationary fee increases. 

Acquisitions.   Our growth strategies include the pursuit of reacquiring regional franchise rights in Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada.   We receive a higher amount of revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions than in our Independent Regions. While both Company-owned Regions and Independent Regions charge relatively similar fees to RE/MAX brokerages and agents, we receive the entire amount of the continuing franchise fee, broker fee, initial franchise fee and franchise renewal fee in Company-owned Regions, whereas we receive only a portion of these fees (generally 15%, 20% or 30%) in Independent Regions.  We also pursue other acquisitions in related areas that build on our core competencies in franchising and real estate brokerage support in order to grow our business.   

Effective November 3, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we intend to acquire certain assets of RE/MAX of New Jersey, including the regional franchise agreements issued by us permitting the sale of RE/MAX franchises in the state of New Jersey.  We expect to use $45 million in cash generated from operations to fund the acquisition.     

Effective September 12, 2016, we acquired certain assets of Full House Mortgage Connection, Inc., ( Full House ) a franchisor of mortgage brokerages.  We used $8.0 million in cash generated from operations to fund the acquisition.  In addition to the initial cash consideration, each year for the first ten years after closing we are required to pay a revenue share payment equal to 8% of gross revenue of the acquired business.  

Effective April 1, 2016, we acquired certain assets of RE/MAX of Alaska, including the regional franchise agreements issued by us permitting the sale of RE/MAX franchises in the state of Alaska.  We used $1.5 million in cash generated from operations to fund the acquisition.     

Effective February 22, 2016, we acquired certain assets of RE/MAX of New York, including the regional franchise agreements permitting the sale of RE/MAX franchises in the state of New York. We used $8.5 million in cash generated from operations to fund the acquisition.  

The comparability of our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is affected by the aforementioned acquisitions. 

Divestitures.   Effective January 20, 2016, we sold certain operating assets and liabilities related to three owned brokerage offices located in the U.S., of STC Northwest, LLC d/b/a RE/MAX Northwest Realtors ( RE/MAX Northwest )  and transferred separate office franchise agreements to the purchaser. We recognized a loss on the sale of the assets and the liabilities transferred of $0.1 million during the first quarter of 2016. 

Effective December 31, 2015,   we sold certain operating assets and liabilities related to 12 owned brokerage offices located in the U.S., of Sacagawea, LLC d/b/a RE/MAX Equity Group ( RE/MAX Equity Group ) and transferred separate office franchise agreements to the purchaser. In connection with this sale, we sold our entire interest in, and transferred all of our obligations related to, our equity-method investments and as a result beginning on January 1, 2016, we no longer record equity in earnings of investees.

Effective April 10, 2015,   we sold certain operating assets and liabilities related to six owned brokerage offices located in the U.S., of RB2B, LLC d/b/a RE/MAX 100 ( RE/MAX 100 ) and transferred separate office franchise agreements to the purchaser.  

Subsequent to the aforementioned dispositions, we no longer receive fees for services provided to affiliate real estate agents and discontinued the recognition of brokerage revenue and all related expenses. The comparability of our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is affected by these dispositions. 

Secondary Offering.   During the fourth quarter of 2015, RIHI redeemed 5,175,000 common units in RMCO in exchange for newly issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Upon redemption, RIHI sold 5,175,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $36.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions of $1.53 per share (the  Secondary Offering ). As of September 30, 2016, we owned 58.42% of the common units in RMCO and RIHI owned the remaining 41.58% of the common units in RMCO. We incurred additional selling, operating and administrative expenses of $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the Secondary Offering primarily for accounting and other professional services performed during the first quarter of 2016, which will impact the comparability of our financial results to the prior year. We did not receive any proceeds from the Secondary Offering, but the change in economic interest in RMCO held by us and RIHI have and will impact the amount of RMCO s net income allocated to RE/MAX Holdings and to the non-controlling interest. Increases in the amount of RMCO s net income allocated to RE/MAX Holdings will directly impact the corporate tax obligations of RE/MAX Holdings and consequently increase the provision for income taxes.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Total Revenue  

A summary of the components of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Continuing Franchise Fees  

Revenue from continuing franchise fees was $20.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $2.0 million or 10.8% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to agent count growth in the U.S. and Canada, rate increases in our Company-owned Regions in the U.S. and Canada which were implemented on July 1, 2016 and the acquisitions of RE/MAX of New York and RE/MAX of Alaska.   

Annual Dues  

Revenue from annual dues increased $0.3 million from the overall increase in total agent count of 7,697 from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016, of which 3,512 agents were located in the U.S. and Canada.  

Broker Fees  

Revenue from broker fees increased $1.2 million primarily due to increased agent count in the U.S. and Canada and the acquisition of RE/MAX of New York.   

Franchise Sales and Other Franchise Revenue  

Franchise sales and other franchise revenue increased $0.2 million primarily due to an increase in the number of franchise renewals in the current year.    

Brokerage Revenue  

Brokerage revenue, which principally represents fees assessed by our previously owned brokerages for services provided to their affiliated real estate agents, decreased $3.3 million due to th  e dispositions of such brokerages.

Operating Expenses  

A summary of the components of our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

Selling, Operating and Administrative Expenses  

A summary of the components of our selling, operating and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Total selling, operating and administrative expenses decreased as follows:  

Personnel costs decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in overall headcount as a result of the dispositions of our previously owned brokerages, partially offset by an increase in benefit related expenses.     

Professional fees increased primarily due to an increase in consulting fees associated with our compliance and strategic initiatives.      

Rent and related facility operations expense decreased primarily due to the sale of our previously owned brokerages.      

Other selling, operating and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense related to a preferred marketing arrangement, partially offset by a decrease of administrative expenses as a result of the sale of our previously owned brokerages.      

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.1 million primarily due to the increase in amortization expense related to the franchise agreements acquired with the acquisitions of RE/MAX of New York and RE/MAX of Alaska.

Table of Contents  

Other Expenses, Net  

A summary of the components of our other expenses, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, is as follows:   

Other expenses, net increased primarily due to the sale of RE/MAX Equity Group on December 31, 2015 and thus no longer recognizing equity in earnings of investees beginning in 2016.  This was offset by a decrease in interest expense primarily due to the reduction in principal balance as a result of the $12.7 million excess cash flow prepayment made on March 31, 2016 pursuant to the terms of our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility.   

Provision for Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes increased $1.4 million primarily due to the Secondary Offering, which resulted in RE/MAX Holdings  weighted average economic interest in RMCO increasing to 58.42% from 41.02% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and due to the increase in RMCO s income before the provision for income taxes.  As a result of the aforementioned factors, our effective income tax rate increased to 24.2% from 17.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective income tax rate depends on many factors, including a rate benefit attributable to the fact that the portion of RMCO s earnings attributable to the non-controlling interests are not subject to corporate-level taxes because RMCO is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore is treated as a  flow through entity,  as well as annual changes in state income tax rates.  

Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest, which represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in RMCO held by RIHI, decreased $2.8 million primarily due to the Secondary Offering, which resulted in a decrease of the non-controlling unitholders weighted average economic interest in RMCO to 41.58% from 58.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in RMCO s net income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015.  

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA was $26.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.8 million from the comparable prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA primarily increased due to an increase in revenue as a result of organic agent count growth and contributions from the acquired New York and Alaska regions.  These aforementioned increases were offset by a decrease due to the sale of our previously owned brokerages.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Total Revenue  

A summary of the components of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Continuing Franchise Fees  

Revenue from continuing franchise fees was $59.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $4.9 million or 8.9% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to agent count growth in the U.S. and Canada, the acquisitions of RE/MAX of New York and RE/MAX of Alaska and a rate increase in continuing franchise fees in our Company-owned Regions in the U.S. and Canada which was implemented on July 1, 2016.  The aforementioned increases were partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.       

Annual Dues  

Revenue from annual dues increased $0.6 million from the overall increase in total agent count of 7,697 from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016, of which 3,512 agents were located in the U.S. and Canada. The aforementioned increase was partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.  

Broker Fees  

Revenue from broker fees increased $3.1 million primarily due to increased agent count in the U.S. and Canada, an increase in home-sales volume and the acquisition of RE/MAX of New York.  The aforementioned increases were partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. 

Franchise Sales and Other Franchise Revenue  

Franchise sales and other franchise revenue increased $0.2 million due to an increase in the number of franchise renewals in the current year and revenue recognized from our preferred marketing arrangements, offset by a reduction in franchise sales revenue related to global sub-regional franchise sales and office franchise sales in U.S. Company-owned Regions. 

Brokerage Revenue  

Brokerage revenue, which principally represents fees assessed by our previously owned brokerages for services provided to their affiliated real estate agents, decreased $10.4 million due to th  e dispositions of such brokerages.

A summary of the components of our selling, operating and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Total selling, operating and administrative expenses decreased as follows:  

Personnel costs decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in overall headcount as a result of the dispositions of our previously owned brokerages, partially offset by an increase in benefit related expenses.     

Professional fees increased primarily due to an increase of costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation-operation stages for purchased and developed software in our information technology infrastructure and an increase in consulting fees associated with our compliance and strategic initiatives.  The aforementioned increases were offset by a decrease due to the sale of our previously owned brokerages.       

Rent and related facility operations expense decreased primarily due to the sale of our previously owned brokerages.

Table of Contents  

The aforementioned increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation expense due to the sale of our previously owned brokerages.  

Sale or Disposition of Assets, Net 

The decrease in the gain on sale or disposition of assets, net is due to the gain of $0.6 million recognized for the sale of RE/MAX 100 during the second quarter of 2015, offset by the loss of $0.1 million recognized for the sale of RE/MAX Northwest during the first quarter of 2016.   

Other Expenses, Net  

A summary of the components of our other expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, is as follows:   

Other expenses, net decreased primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses driven primarily by the repatriation of cash generated from our Canadian operations in February 2015.  Interest expense also contributed to a decrease in other expenses, net due primarily to costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 associated with an amendment to our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility, as discussed in   Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as a reduction in principal balance of the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility as a result of the $12.7 million excess cash flow prepayment made on March 31, 2016.  Other expenses, net increased due to the sale of RE/MAX Equity Group on December 31, 2015 and thus no longer recognizing equity in earnings of investees beginning in 2016.   

Provision for Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes increased $3.3 million primarily due to the Secondary Offering, which resulted in RE/MAX Holdings  weighted average economic interest in RMCO increasing to 58.39% from 40.61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and due to the increase in RMCO s income before the provision for income taxes.  As a result of the aforementioned factors, our effective income tax rate increased to 23.7% from 18.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective income tax rate depends on many factors, including a rate benefit attributable to the fact that the portion of RMCO s earnings attributable to the non-controlling interests are not subject to corporate-level taxes because RMCO is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore is treated as a  flow through entity,  as well as annual changes in state income tax rates.  

Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest, which represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in RMCO held by RIHI, decreased $7.4 million primarily due to the Secondary Offering, which resulted in a decrease of the non-controlling unitholders weighted average economic interest in RMCO to 41.61% from 59.39% for

Table of Contents  

the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.2 million in RMCO s net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over September 30, 2015.  

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA was $72.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $2.7 million from the comparable prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA primarily increased due to agent count growth, contributions from our acquired New York and Alaska regions, and the positive impact from foreign currency transaction gains and losses driven primarily by the repatriation of cash generated from our Canadian operations in February 2015.  The aforementioned increases were offset by a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from the sale of our previously owned brokerages and an increase in costs incurred during preliminary project and post-implementation-operation stages for purchased and developed software in our information technology infrastructure.     

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), such as Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and the provision for income taxes, each of which is presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), adjusted for the impact of the following items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance: loss or gain on sale or disposition of assets and sublease, loss on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash straight-line rent expense, professional fees and certain expenses incurred in connection with the initial public offering and subsequent Secondary Offering, acquisition related expenses and severance related expenses.  

Because Adjusted EBITDA omits certain non-cash items and other non-recurring cash charges or other items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances that affect our operating performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other non-cash and non-recurring cash charges or other items, and is more reflective of other factors that affect our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of our business.  

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:  

this measure does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;      

this measure does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;      

this measure does not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;      

this measure does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;      

this measure does not reflect the cash requirements to pay dividends to stockholders of our Class A common stock and tax and other cash distributions to our non-controlling unitholders;      

this measure does not reflect the cash requirements to pay RIHI and Oberndorf pursuant to the TRAs;      

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and      

43 

Table of Contents  

other companies may calculate this measure differently, so similarly named measures may not be comparable.      

A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for our consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is set forth in the following table: 

(1) 

Represents gains on the sale or disposition of assets as well as the gains on the sublease of a portion of our corporate headquarters office building.      

(3) 

Represents the non-cash charge to appropriately record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement taking into consideration escalation in monthly cash payments.      

(4) 

Represents costs incurred for compliance services performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the Secondary Offering.      

(5) 

Includes severance and other related expenses due to organizational changes in our executive leadership.       

(6) 

Acquisition related expenses include fees incurred in connection with our acquisitions of certain assets of HBN, Inc. ( HBN ) and Tails, Inc. ( Tails ) in October 2013, of RE/MAX of New York in February 2016 and of RE/MAX of Alaska in April 2016. Costs include legal, accounting and advisory fees as well as consulting fees for integration services.      

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Overview of Factors Affecting Our Liquidity  

Our liquidity position has been positively affected by the growth of our agent base and improving conditions in the real estate market, which have contributed to increasing annual operating cash flows. In this regard, our short-term liquidity position has been, and will continue to be, affected by the number of agents in the RE/MAX network.   Our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash balances and credit availability under our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our cash flows are primarily related to the timing of (i) cash receipt of revenues, (ii) payment of selling, operating and administrative expenses, (iii) principal and related interest payments on our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility, (iv) distributions and other payments to non-controlling unitholders, (v) corporate tax payments paid by us, (vi) cash consideration for acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses, (vii) dividend payments to stockholders of our Class A common stock and (viii) payments to RIHI and Oberndorf pursuant to the TRAs. See Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details on the TRA assignment from Weston Presidio V, L.P. to Oberndorf. We have satisfied these needs with cash flows from operations and funds available under our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Table of Contents  

We will continue to evaluate potential financing transactions, including refinancing our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility and extending maturities. There can be no assurance that financing or refinancing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Future indebtedness may impose various additional restrictions and covenants on us which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments, to make dividend payments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Our ability to make payments to fund debt service obligations and strategic acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control.  

Sources and Uses of Cash  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $102.0 million and $110.2 million, respectively, of which approximately $11.0 million and $7.0 million were denominated in foreign currencies, respectively.  During the first quarter of 2015, we began to repatriate cash generated by our Canadian operations on a regular basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we repatriated $12.2 million and $33.6 million in Canadian dollars, respectively, or $9.3 million and $26.8 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. Of these amounts, $23.9 million in Canadian dollars, or $19.2 million in U.S. dollars, was repatriated in February 2015. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the payments in February 2016 of $3.3 million resulting from a litigation judgment and $1.3 million pursuant to the TRAs, neither of which occurred in the comparable prior year period as well as changes in other working capital.  Cash provided by operating activities also decreased due to an increase in cash paid for income taxes of $5.4 million as a result of changes in our ownership structure, timing of tax payments and a decrease in excess tax benefit realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 upon the exercise of stock options.  Cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by a reduction in cash paid for interest of $0.9 million primarily related to fees incurred in connection with amending our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility on March 11, 2015. 

Cash used in investing activities increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of RE/MAX of New York in February 2016 for a net purchase price of $8.4 million, the acquisition of RE/MAX of Alaska in April 2016 for a net purchase price of $1.5 million, the acquisition of Full House in September 2016 with an initial cash consideration payment of $8.0 million and an increase in the purchases of property, equipment and software of $1.0 million primarily related to investments in our information technology infrastructure. 

45 

Table of Contents  

The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $24.7 million in distributions paid to our non-controlling unitholders and a decrease of $14.5 million in dividends paid to Class A common stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding amounts paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These decreases were primarily attributable to the declaration and payment of a special dividend of $1.50 per share on all outstanding shares of Class A common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which contributed to a $26.6 million decrease in distributions paid to our non-controlling unitholders and a $17.9 million decrease in dividends paid to Class A common stockholders.  In addition, cash used in financing activities decreased due to $0.6 million paid in connection with amending our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility on March 11, 2015.  The aforementioned decreases were offset by an increase of $5.4 million in the mandatory excess cash flow prepayments made in March 2016 compared to March 2015 pursuant to the terms of our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility and a reduction in cash received of $1.9 million from the decrease in stock option exercises during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015.   

Financing Resources  

In July 2013, RE/MAX, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RMCO, entered into the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders party thereto. Under the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility, RE/MAX, LLC also has a revolving line of credit available of up to $10.0 million. On the closing date of the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility, RE/MAX, LLC borrowed $230.0 million of term loans thereunder. The proceeds provided by these term loans were used to refinance and repay existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.  

On March 11, 2015, the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility was amended, providing for an increase to the maximum applicable margin for both LIBOR and ABR loans by 0.25%, and a modification of certain liquidity covenants in order to increase the amounts RE/MAX, LLC may distribute to RMCO to enable RMCO to increase the dividends declared and paid to its unitholders. In connection with this amendment, RE/MAX, LLC incurred costs of $1.1 million, of which $0.6 million was recorded as an unamortized debt discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the remaining $0.5 million was expensed as incurred.  

RE/MAX, LLC is required to make principal payments out of excess cash flow, as defined in the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility, as well as from the proceeds of certain asset sales, proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness and from insurance recoveries. RE/MAX, LLC made an excess cash flow prepayment of $12.7 million on March 31, 2016.  

As of September 30, 2016, RE/MAX, LLC had $186.6 million of term loans outstanding, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, had no revolving loans outstanding and had $10.0 million in revolving loans available under the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility.  

Term loans are repaid in quarterly installments of $0.5 million, with the balance of the term loan due at maturity. The quarterly installments will be reduced pro rata by the amount of any excess cash flow principal prepayments made. The maturity date of all of the term loans under the 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility is July 31, 2020. Term loans may be optionally prepaid by RE/MAX, LLC at any time. All amounts outstanding, if any, under the revolving line of credit must be repaid on July 31, 2018.  

The 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility requires compliance with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio any time amounts are drawn under the revolving line of credit.   

Cash Priorities  

Liquidity  

Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities and access to our revolving line of credit available to support the needs of our business.

Capital Expenditures  

The total aggregate amount paid for purchases of property and equipment and purchased and developed software was $3.2 million and $2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amounts paid for purchases of property and equipment relate to office equipment for our corporate headquarters and spending on purchased and developed software relate to investments in our information technology infrastructure. In order to expand our technological capabilities, we have invested in information technology projects that will improve operational efficiencies and enhance the tools and services provided to the agents and brokers in our network. We anticipate spending between $4.0 million and $4.25 million during 2016 on total capital expenditures. 

Dividends  

Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.15 per share on all outstanding shares of Class A common stock in each of the first three quarters of 2016 as disclosed in Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. On November 3, 2016 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on all outstanding shares of Class A common stock, which is payable on December 1, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2016.  The declaration of additional future dividends, and, if declared, the amount of any such future dividend, will be subject to our actual future earnings and capital requirements and to the discretion of our Board of Directors.   

Distributions and Other Payments to Non-controlling Unitholders 

As a limited liability company (treated as a partnership for income tax purposes), RMCO does not incur significant federal, state or local income taxes, as these taxes are primarily the obligations of its members.     As authorized by the RMCO, LLC Agreement, RMCO makes cash distributions to non-controlling unitholders.  Discretionary cash distributions may be made to non-controlling unitholders based on their ownership percentage in RMCO as determined in accordance with the RMCO, LLC Agreement.  These discretionary distributions are paid on a quarterly basis equal to the dividend payments to the stockholders of the Company s Class A common stock, including the dividends declared on November 3, 2016, or otherwise on a discretionary basis as necessary.  In addition, RMCO is generally required to distribute cash on a pro-rata basis to its members to the extent necessary to cover each member s estimated tax liabilities, if any, with respect to their allocable share of RMCO earnings, but only to the extent that any other discretionary distributions from RMCO for the relevant period were otherwise insufficient to enable each member to cover its estimated tax liabilities.  Upon completion of its tax returns with respect to the prior year, RMCO may make other discretionary true-up distributions to its members, if cash is available for such purposes, with respect to actual taxable income for the prior year.  See Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on distributions made by RMCO.   

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.  

Commitments and Contingencies  

Except for the outstanding lease guarantees acquired in connection with the dispositions of our previously owned brokerages and the ongoing litigation concerning our acquisition of the net assets of Tails as disclosed in Note 12 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management does not believe there are any other litigation matters involving us that could result, individually or in the aggregate, in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates disclosed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for which there were no material changes, included: 

Allowances for Accounts and Notes Receivable     

Goodwill Impairment Testing     

Franchise Agreements and Other Intangible Assets     

Acquisitions   Purchase Price Allocation

I  tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  

We have operations both within the U.S. and globally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our large franchisees. In addition, our investment strategy has been to invest in financial instruments that are highly liquid and mature within three months from the date of purchase. We do not currently use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures nor do we use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  

Interest Rate Risk  

We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility which bears interest at variable rates. As of September 30, 2016, we had a principal balance of $188.4 million outstanding under our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the undrawn borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit under our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility was $10.0 million. The interest rate on our 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facility entered into in July 2013 and as amended on March 11, 2015 is currently subject to a LIBOR rate floor of 1%, plus an applicable margin. If LIBOR rates rise above the floor, then each hypothetical 1/8% increase would result in additional annual interest expense of $0.2 million.

Currency Risk  

We have a network of global franchisees in over 100 countries and territories, including the U.S. and Canada. Fees imposed on independent franchisees and agents in foreign countries are charged in the local currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies and cash held in foreign currencies can result, and have resulted, in fluctuations in our operating income and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. As the U.S. dollar has strengthened compared to most foreign currencies, including the Canadian dollar during 2015 and 2016, our financial position and results of operations have been adversely affected. We had foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $0.1 and $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $0.1 million and ($1.6) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we began to repatriate cash generated by certain of our Canadian operations to the U.S. on a regular basis and expect to continue to do so prospectively. We currently do not engage in any foreign exchange hedging activity but may do so in the future. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, a hypothetical 5% strengthening or weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre-tax income of approximately $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively.   

I  tem 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.   O  THER INFORMATION 

I  tem 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time we are involved in litigation, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. We do not believe we have any currently pending litigation of which the outcome will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operations; however, litigation and other claims and regulatory proceedings against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.  

I  tem 1A. Risk Factors  

For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, please see  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ) and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 (the  Second Quarter 10-Q ).  In addition, the following risk factor updates and supplements the risk factors described in our 2015 Annual Report  and Second Quarter 10-Q.   Except as provided below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report and Second Quarter 10-Q.   

We are new to the mortgage brokerage industry, which may hinder our efforts to establish and grow our new mortgage brokerage franchising business, Motto Mortgage. 

We are pursuing a growth strategy to offer and sell residential mortgage brokerage franchises in the U.S under the  Motto Mortgage  brand and trademarks.  Our investments in the new Motto Mortgage business include the cost of our acquisition of certain assets of Full House and start-up funding for the business.  We believe the Motto Mortgage business has the potential to be highly complementary to our core business.  However, we lack operating experience in the mortgage brokerage industry.  Our strategy hinges on our ability to recruit, develop, and maintain strong competencies within the mortgage brokerage market, favorable conditions in the related regulatory environment and our success in developing a strong, respected brand.  We may fail adequately to understand, interpret, implement and/or train franchisees concerning compliance requirements related to the mortgage brokerage industry or the relationship between us and our franchisees, any of which failures could subject us or our franchisees to adverse actions from regulators.  As a start-up, the Motto Mortgage brand s initial lack of recognition, may hamper franchise sales efforts.  We may experience impairment of acquired assets and/or potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition of the business of Full House.  This venture could distract members of management from our RE/MAX business, and a prolonged diversion could negatively impact operating results.
