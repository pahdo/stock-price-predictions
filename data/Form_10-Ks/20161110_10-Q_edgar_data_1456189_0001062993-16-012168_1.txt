LEATT CORPORATION    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)    
  Note 1 - Basis of presentation   
 The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was
audited and appears in the Form 10-K filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on March 18, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, changes in stockholders  equity for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, and the related information contained in these notes have been prepared by
management without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which
include only normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles as of September 30, 2016 and for all periods
presented have been made. Interim operating results are not necessarily
indicative of operating results for a full year.  
 Certain information and note disclosures normally included in
the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. While
management of the Company believes that the disclosures presented are adequate
to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that these condensed
consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company s Form 10-K.
 
  Note 2 - Inventory  
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory consists
primarily of finished goods. Shipping and handling costs are included in the
cost of inventory. In assessing the inventory value, the Company must make
estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence,
aging of inventory and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition
of products. In performing such evaluations, the Company utilizes historical
experience as well as current market information. The reserve for obsolescence
as of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $186,899 and
$367,587, respectively.  
  Note 3 - Intangible Assets   
 The Company s intangible assets consist of acquired patents
with an indefinite useful life and are thus not amortized. Intangible assets are
carried at cost less impairment. Amortization expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was zero. There was no impairment of intangible assets at
September 30, 2016.  
  Note 4 - Short-term Loan   
 The Company carries two product liability insurance policies;
one with a U.S. insurance carrier and a second with a South African insurance
carrier. The Company finances payment of its short-term insurance premiums over
the period of coverage, which is generally twelve months. The U.S. short-term
loan is payable in monthly installments of $71,952 over an 11-month period at an
APR of 2.897% and the South African short-term loan is payable in monthly
installments of $1,708 over a 10-month period at a flat interest rate of 3.90% .
The Company repaid the U.S. short-term loan in full on September 1, 2016. 
 The Company also carries directors and officers  liability
insurance. The Company finances payment of its short-term insurance premiums
over the period of coverage, which is generally twelve months. The short-term
loan is payable in eleven payments of $5,375 at a 3.397% annual interest rate.
 
  Note 5- Income Taxes   
 The Company uses the asset and liability approach to account
for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income
tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is applied against
any net deferred tax asset if, based on available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
provision for income taxes included taxes currently payable, if any, plus the
net change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded by
the Company. 
 The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 740-10,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( Standard ), which provides that the
tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the consolidated
financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being
sustained upon an examination by tax authorities. An uncertain income tax
position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being
sustained. Additionally, the standard provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties; accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition, and any amounts when incurred would be recorded under
these provisions.  
 The Company s practice is to recognize interest and/or
penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits.

Note 6 - Net Income Per Share of Common Stock   
 Basic net income per common share is computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
stock shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had 473,000 potential
common shares, consisting of 120,000 preferred shares and options to purchase
353,000 shares, outstanding. 
  Note 7   Common Stock  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 323,000 stock
options were granted at an exercise price of $2.60 per share, exercisable over a
5-year period. The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated at the
date of grant using the Black Sholes option-pricing model. Based on the list of
assumptions presented below, the fair value of the options granted during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1.80.  
 
 The expected volatility was determined with reference to the
historical volatility of the Company's stock. The Company uses historical data
to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model.
The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that the
options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for
periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury
rate in effect at the time of grant.  
 Stock-based compensation expense related to vested stock
options granted during the nine months ended September, 2016 was $154,440. As of
September 30, 2016, there was $426,960 of unrecognized compensation costs
related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a
3-year vesting period.  
 In addition, on April 7, 2016, the Company issued 26,220 shares
of common stock to employees who exercised employee stock options in a cashless
exercise; and on March 29, 2016 an employee exercised stock options for the
Company to issue 39,000 shares for $39,000. On May 24, 2016, the Company also
cancelled and returned 26,451 shares of common stock, granted to a former
employee, to authorized and unissued status in settlement of a legal matter. The
fair value of the shares as of the date of cancellation was $73,533 and is
included in other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. On
September 1, 2016, the Company issued 92,400 shares of common stock to employees
who exercised employee stock options in a cashless exercise.  
  Note 8   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09,
as amended, outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most
current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This
new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when
and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require an entity to recognize
revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. On August
12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date". The amendments in this update
defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The
ASU, as amended, is effective for the first interim period within an annual
period beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted.
The Company is evaluating the provisions of this update and has not determined
the impact that its adoption will have on the Company s financial position or
results of operations.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic
330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which applies to inventory that
is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. This ASU
simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of
cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. The ASU
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." This ASU
requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current
on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and non-current.
This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
elected to retrospectively adopt this accounting standard in the beginning of
the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and as a result, prior periods in the
consolidated financial statements were adjusted. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842).  This ASU is a comprehensive new lease standard that amends various
aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. The core principle of this
ASU will require lessees to present the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on their balance
sheets. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is evaluating the new standard to determine the impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 - 7 - 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No
2016-09   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment   Accounting  
("ASC 2016-09"). ASC 2016-09 will change certain aspects of accounting for
share-based payments to employees. The new guidance will require all income tax
effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest
or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an
employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without
triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for
forfeitures as they occur. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The
Company is evaluating the new standard to determine the impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 addresses
how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for the Company in the first
quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a
retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the new standard to determine
the impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than
Inventory   ("ASU 2016-16"). The ASU clarifies the accounting for the current
and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than
inventory. The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018,
with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified
retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the new standard to determine
the impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-17,   Consolidation   ("ASU 2016-17"). The ASU amends the
consolidation guidance on how variable interest entities should treat indirect
interest in the entity held through related parties. The ASU is effective for
the Company in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted, and is
to be applied using a retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the
adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.  
 The Company does not believe there are any other recent
accounting pronouncements that would have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.  
  Note 9 - Litigation   
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
various legal proceedings involving product liability and personal injury and
intellectual property litigation. The Company is insured against loss for
certain of these matters. The Company will record contingent liabilities
resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it when it is probable
that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably
estimable. The Company will disclose contingent liabilities when there is a
reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded
liability. While the outcome of currently pending litigation is not yet
determinable, the ultimate exposure with respect to these matters cannot be
ascertained. However, based on the information currently available to the
Company, the Company does not expect that any liabilities or costs that might be
incurred to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the
Company. 
  Note 10   Subsequent Events   
 The company has evaluated all subsequent events through the
date the financial statements were released. 
 The Company entered into a Premium Finance Agreement with AFCO
Acceptance Corporation  AFCO,  dated October 13, 2016, to finance its U.S.
short-term insurance over the period of the coverage. The Company is obligated
to pay AFCO an aggregate sum of $637,260 in eleven payments of $58,921, at an
annual interest rate of 3.397%, commencing on November 1, 2016 and ending on
September 1, 2017. Any late payment during the term of the agreement will be
assessed a late penalty of 5% of the payment amount due, and in the event of
default AFCO has the right to accelerate the payment due under the agreement.

 Overview of our Business  
 
 Leatt designs, develops, markets and distributes personal
protective equipment for participants in all forms of motor sports and leisure
activities, including riders of motorcycles, bicycles, snowmobiles and ATVs, as

The Company s flagship products are based on the Leatt-Brace 
system, a patented injection molded neck protection system owned by Xceed
Holdings, designed to prevent potentially devastating injuries to the cervical
spine and neck. The Company has the exclusive global manufacturing,
distribution, sale and use rights to the Leatt-Brace , pursuant to a license
agreement between the Company and Xceed Holdings, a company owned and controlled
by the Company s Chairman and founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt. The Company also
has the right to use apparatus embodying, employing and containing the
Leatt-Brace  technology and has designed, developed, marketed and distributed
other personal protective equipment using this technology, as well as its own
developed technology, including the Company s new body protection products which
it markets under the Leatt Protection Range brand. 
 The Company s research and development efforts are conducted at
its research facilities, located at its executive headquarters in Cape Town,
South Africa. Five of the Company s full-time employees are dedicated
exclusively to research, development, and testing. The Company also utilizes
consultants, academic institutions and engineering companies as independent
contractors or consultants, from time to time, to assist it with its research
and development efforts. Leatt products have been tested and reviewed internally
and by external bodies. All Leatt products are compliant with applicable
European Union directives, or CE certified, where appropriate. Certain products,
such as the MRX Head and Neck Restraint system, have been certified by SFI
Foundation (USA) and the Moto GPX was tested by BMW Motorrad (Germany) and
reviewed by KTM (Austria). The Company is also in discussions with governing and
racing bodies, such as the F d ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the
F d ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) and the National Association for
Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), to have the Leatt-Brace  accredited by these
bodies. 
 Our products are manufactured in China under outsource
manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers located there. The
Company utilizes outside consultants and its own employees to ensure the quality
of its products through regular on-site product inspections. Products purchased
through international sales are usually shipped directly from our manufacturers 
warehouses or points of dispatch to customers or their import agents.  
 Leatt earns revenues through the sale of its products through
approximately 60 distributors worldwide, who in turn sell its products to
retailers. Leatt distributors are required to follow certain standard business
terms and guidelines for the sale and distribution of Leatt products. Two Eleven
and Leatt SA directly distribute Leatt products to retailers in the United
States and South Africa, respectively. 
 
 Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance  
 
 We believe that the following factors will continue to affect
our financial performance:  

Global Economic Fragility and Currency Fluctuations   
   A
  portion of our revenues are earned in international markets and the ongoing
  turmoil in the global economy, especially in the European Union, including the
  recent decision of United Kingdom (UK) voters to leave the European Union
  (EU), may have an impact on our business and our financial condition. This
  economic turmoil has led to continued currency weakness in our international
  markets against a strengthening U.S. Dollar, resulting in declining revenues
  from sales in those markets. We may face more challenges from currency moves
  as the UK moves forward with plans to exit the EU and if economic conditions
  do not otherwise improve. These economic conditions impact levels of consumer
  spending in international markets, which have declined over the past three
  quarters and may remain so for the foreseeable future. If demand for our
  products fluctuates as a result of these economic conditions or otherwise, our
  revenue and gross margin will continue to be harmed. Management continues to
  monitor currency fluctuations globally and evaluate marketing and sales
  strategies accordingly.  

Fuel Prices     Significant fluctuations in fuel prices
  could have both a positive and negative effect on our business and operations.
  A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sales and
  significant fluctuations in world fuel prices could significantly increase the
  price of shipping or transporting our products which we may not be able to
  pass on to our customers. On the other hand, fluctuations in fuel prices lead
  to higher commuter costs which may encourage the increased use of motorcycles
  and bicycles as alternative modes of transportation and lead to an increase in
  the market for our protection products.  

Product Liability Litigation     We face an inherent business
  risk of exposure to product liability claims arising from the claimed failure
  of our products to help prevent the types of personal injury or death against
  which they are designed to help protect. Therefore we have acquired very
  costly product liability insurance worldwide. We have not experienced any
  material uninsured losses due to product liability claims, but it is possible
  that we could experience material losses in the future. After a two-week trial
  in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio
  (Eastern) ending on April 17, 2014, a federal jury returned a defense verdict
  for the Company in the first Leatt-Brace  product liability lawsuit to be
  tried in the United States. The plaintiffs in that case had alleged that
  defective product design and failure to warn had caused a then fifteen
  year-old motocross rider, to suffer multiple mid-thoracic spine fractures,
  causing immediate and permanent paraplegia, when he crashed at a relatively
  low speed on February 13, 2011. When the accident occurred, he was wearing a
  helmet and other safety gear from several different companies, including the
  Company's acclaimed Leatt-Brace . The
  Company produced evidence at trial showing
  that his thoracic paraplegia was an unavoidable consequence of his fall, not
  the result of wearing a Leatt-Brace , and that the neck brace likely saved his
  life (or saved him from quadriplegia) by preventing cervical spine injury. The
  Company had maintained from the onset that this and a small handful of other
  lawsuits are without merit and that it will vigorously defend itself in each
  case. In this case, the plaintiffs subsequently appealed the court s decision
  and the parties reached an amicable settlement. Although we carry product
  liability insurance, a successful claim brought against us could significantly
  harm our business and financial condition and have an adverse impact on our
  ability to renew our product liability insurance or secure new coverage.  

- 10 - 

Protection of Intellectual Property        We believe that
  the continued success of our business is dependent on our intellectual
  property portfolio consisting of globally registered trademarks, design
  patents and utility patents related to the Leatt-Brace . We believe that a
  loss of these rights would harm or cause a material disruption to our business
  and, our corporate strategy is to aggressively take legal action against any
  violators of our intellectual property rights, regardless of where they may
  be. From time to time, we have had to enforce our intellectual property rights
  through litigation and we may be required to do so in the future. Such
  litigation may result in substantial costs and could divert resources and
  management attention from the operations of our business.   
 
  Results of Operations   
 
 The following summary of our results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included herein.
The following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for
the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales revenue and
key components of our revenue for the periods indicated in dollars and
percentages. 
 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the
Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 
 The following table summarizes the results of our operations
during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and provides
information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) in such
periods: 
 - 11 - 

Revenues    We earn revenues from the sale of our
protective gear, comprising neck braces, body armor, helmets and other products,
parts and accessories both in the United States and abroad. Revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 were $4.63 million, a 1 % decrease,
compared to revenues of $4.66 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
Revenues from sales to international customers were $2.7 million and $3.2
million, or 58% and 69% of revenues, respectively, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. Revenues from sales to our customers in the United
States were $ 1.93 million and $1.45 million, respectively for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in worldwide revenues is
primarily attributable to a $0.02 million decrease in neck brace sales, and a
$0.2 million decrease in body armor sales, that was partially offset by a $0.07
million increase in helmet sales and a $0.1 million increase in sales of other
products, parts and accessories.  
 The following table sets forth our revenues by product line for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

- 12 - 

Sales of our flagship neck brace accounted for $1.88 million
and $1.89 million, or 40% and 41% of our revenues for the quarters ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A 16% decrease in neck brace sales
volumes to our customers outside of the United States was the primary reason for
the 1% decrease in neck brace revenues during the third quarter of 2016. The
decrease is attributable to the continued strengthening of the US dollar against
the local currencies of our customers in Australasia and Europe when compared to
the comparative period. Neck brace revenues from sales to our customers in the
United States increased by 12% during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to
the third quarter of 2015. 
 Our body armor products are comprised of chest protectors, full
upper body protectors, upper body protection vests, back protectors, knee braces
and knee and elbow guards. Body armor sales accounted for $2.22 million and
$2.43 million, or 48% and 52% of our revenues for the quarters ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 8% decrease in body armor revenues was
primarily the result of a 65 % decrease in knee brace sales to our customers
globally, when compared to the 2016 period. Initial stocking shipments of our
C-Frame knee brace to our international customers were made during the third
quarter of 2014 with further stocking shipments made in the first and second
quarters of 2015. The strengthening of the US dollar discussed above has
resulted in decreased sales and consequently increased inventory levels of
C-Frame knee braces at the distributor level. 
 Our helmets accounted for $0.07 million or 2% of our revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The 100% increase in helmet
revenues is due to the continuation of the initial shipment of our GPX 5.5
Composite, GPX 6.5 Carbon, DBX 6.0 Carbon and DBX 5.0 Composite helmets that
first shipped to our customers in the United States and abroad during the fourth
quarter of 2015. 
 Our other products, parts and accessories are comprised of
apparel, aftermarket support items required primarily to replace worn or damaged
parts through our global distribution network, as well as clothing, outerwear
and accessories including hats, jackets, bags, hydration kits and cooling
garments. Other products, parts and accessories sales accounted for $0.45
million and $0.33 million, or 10% and 7% of our revenues for the quarters ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 36% increase in revenues from the
sale of other products, parts and accessories is primarily due to the initial
shipment of our GPX apparel line designed for off-road motorcycle use. 
  Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit    Cost of revenues for
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2.18 million and $2.20
million, respectively. Gross Profit for the quarters ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $2.45 million and $2.45 million, respectively, or 53% and 53% of
revenues respectively. Our neck brace products continue to generate a higher
gross margin than our other product categories. Neck brace revenues accounted
for 40% and 41% of our revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 respectively.  
  Product Royalty Income    Product royalty income is
earned on sales to distributors that have royalty agreements in place, as well
as on sales of licensed products by third parties that have licensing agreements
in place. Product royalty income for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $16,224 and $75,268, respectively. The 78% decrease in product royalty
income is due to a decrease in sales of our licensed products by licensees in
the 2016 period.  
  Salaries and Wages    Salaries and wages for the quarters
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $548,829 and $501,156, respectively. This
10% increase in salaries and wages during the 2016 period was primarily due to
the employment of additional international sales and marketing personnel based
in Europe. 
  Commissions and Consulting Expense    During the quarters
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, commissions and consulting expenses were
$144,480 and $108,020, respectively. This 34% increase in commissions and
consulting expenses is primarily the result of increased commissions paid to the
Company s sales representatives in the United States in line with the increased
revenues discussed above.  
  Professional Fees    Professional fees consist of costs
incurred for audit, tax and regulatory filings, as well as patent protection and
product liability litigation expenses incurred as the Company continues to
expand. Professional fees for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $110,700 and $126,407, respectively. This 12% decrease in professional fees
is primarily due to decreased spending in product liability litigation in the
2016 period.  
  Advertising and Marketing    The Company places paid
advertising in various motorsport magazines and online media, and sponsors
several events, teams and individuals to increase product and brand visibility.
Advertising and marketing expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $502,522 and $504,017, respectively. Advertising and marketing
expenditures during the 2016 period were flat when compared to the prior period.

Office Rent and Expenses    Office rent and expenses for
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $66,593 and $60,755,
respectively. The 10% increase in office rent and expenses is primarily due to
additional warehouse space required at Two Eleven, our US subsidiary to
accommodate our growing product range.  
  Research and Development Costs    These costs consist of
the salaries of personnel who are directly involved in the research and
development of innovative products, as well as the direct costs associated with
developing these products. Research and development costs for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 increased to $402,924, from $298,200, during the same 2015
quarter. The 35% increase in research and development costs is a result of costs
incurred to widen the Company s product range, as well as the employment of
additional design and development resources. 
  Bad Debt Expense      Bad Debt Expense for the
quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $16,216 and $59,314,
respectively. The 73% decrease in bad debt expense is primarily the result of
the write off of a portion of unrecoverable debt owed to Two Eleven during the
2015 compared period. 
  General and Administrative Expenses    General and
administrative expenses consist of insurance, travel, merchant fees, telephone,
office and computer supplies. General and administrative expenses for the
quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $505,194 and $435,517,
respectively. The 16% increase in general and administrative expenses is
primarily as a result of increased travel costs incurred by the Company s sales
and marketing team in the United States and abroad.  
  Depreciation Expense      Depreciation Expense for
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $103,586 and $95,677,
respectively. This 8% increase in depreciation is primarily as a result of the
addition of molds and tooling required for the production of the Company s
widening product range. 
  Total Operating Expenses    Total operating expenses
increased by $211,961 to $2.4 million in the three months ended September 30,
2016, or 10%, compared to $2.2 million in the 2015 period. This increase is
primarily due to increased research and development and travel costs discussed
above.  
  Net income    The net income after income taxes for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $39,256 as opposed to a net income after
income taxes of $178,966 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. This decrease
in net income is primarily due to the decrease in revenues and increase in
operating expenses discussed above.  
 
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015    
 
 The following table summarizes the results of our operations
during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and provides
information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) in such
periods: 
 - 14 - 

Revenues    Revenues of the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016 were $13.2 million, a 5% decrease, compared to revenues of
$13.9 million for the period ended September 30, 2015. Revenues associated with
international customers were $7.5 million and $9.11 million, or 57% and 66% of
revenues, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
Revenues from sales to our customers in the United States were $5.70 million and
$4.79 million, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. The decrease in worldwide revenues is attributable to a $1.4 million
decrease in neck brace sales and a $0.68 million decrease in body armor sales,
which was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in helmet sales.  
 The following table sets forth our revenues by product line for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Sales of our flagship neck brace accounted for $4.8 million and
$6.1 million, or 36% and 44% of our revenues for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A 40% decrease in neck brace sales
volumes to our customers outside of the United States was the primary reason for
the 22% decrease in neck brace revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. This decrease is attributable to a 100% decrease in the volumes of
neck braces sold to our OEM customers outside of the  
 - 15 - 

United States during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
as well as the continued strengthening of the US dollar against the local
currencies in Australasia and Europe compared to the comparative prior period.
 
 Body armor sales accounted for $6.2 million and $6.9 million,
or 47% and 50% of our revenues of the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The 10% decrease in body armor revenues was primarily
the result of a 47% decrease in the volume of C-Frame knee braces shipped to our
customers globally. Initial stocking shipments of our C-Frame knee brace to our
international customers were made during the third quarter of 2014, with further
stocking shipments made in the first and second quarters of 2015. The
strengthening of the US dollar discussed above has resulted in decreased sales
and consequently increased inventory levels of C-Frame knee braces at the
distributor level. Management continues to monitor currency fluctuations
globally and evaluate marketing and sales strategies accordingly.  
 Our helmets accounted for $1.26 million, or 10% of our revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The 100% increase in helmet
revenues is due to the continuation of the initial shipment of our GPX 5.5
Composite, GPX 6.5 Carbon helmets, DBX 5.0 Composite and DBX 6.0 Carbon helmets
to our international customers and in the United States during the first nine
months of 2016.  
 Our other products, parts and accessories are comprised of
apparel, aftermarket support items required primarily to replace worn or damaged
parts through our global distribution network, as well as clothing, outerwear
and accessories including hats, jackets, bags, hydration kits and cooling
garments. Other products, parts and accessories sales accounted for $0.92
million and $0.83 million, or 7% and 6% of our revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 10% increase in revenues
from the sale of other products, parts and accessories is primarily due to the
initial shipment of our GPX apparel line designed for off-road motorcycle
use. 
  Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit    Cost of revenues for
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $6.2 million and
$6.4 million, respectively. Gross Profit for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $6.9 million and $7.5 million, respectively, or
53% and 54% of revenues respectively. Our neck brace products continue to
generate a higher gross margin than our other product categories. Neck brace
revenues accounted for 36% and 44% of our revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Product Royalty Income    Product royalty income is
earned on sales to distributors that have royalty agreements in place, as well
as on sales of licensed products by third parties that have licensing agreements
in place. Product royalty income for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were $69,755 and $147,469, respectively. The 53% decrease in
product royalty income is due to a decrease in sales of licensed products by
licensees.  
  Salaries and Wages    Salaries and wages for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,754,043 and
$1,649,801, respectively. This 6% increase in salaries and wages during the 2016
period was due to the vesting of share options issued to key personnel during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as well as the employment of
additional sales and marketing personnel based in Europe.  
  Commissions and Consulting Expense    During the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, commissions and consulting
expenses were $444,472 and $445,396, respectively. Commission and consulting
expenses were flat when compared to the prior period. 
  Professional Fees    Professional fees consist of costs
incurred for audit, tax and regulatory filings, as well as patent protection and
product liability litigation expenses incurred as the Company continues to
expand. Professional fees for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $363,018 and $587,572, respectively. This 38% decrease in
professional fees is primarily due to decreased spending on product liability
litigation during the 2016 period.  
  Advertising and Marketing    The Company places paid
advertising in various motorsport magazines and online media, and sponsors a
number of events, teams and individuals to increase product and brand
visibility. Advertising and marketing expenses for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,216,916 and $1,128,772, respectively. The 8%
increase in advertising and marketing expenditures during the 2016 period is
primarily due to the Company s continued implementation of sponsorships,
advertising and marketing campaigns designed to promote the Company s widening
product categories and brand. 
  Office Rent and Expenses    Office rent and expenses for
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $193,745 and
$183,826, respectively. The 5% increase in office rent and expenses is primarily
due to additional warehouse space required at Two Eleven, our US subsidiary to
accommodate our growing product range.  
  Research and Development Costs    These costs consist of
the salaries of personnel who are directly involved in the research and
development of innovative products, as well as the direct costs associated with
developing these products. Research and development costs for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, increased to $1,083,983, from $884,583, during the same 2015 nine-month
period. The 23% increase in research and development costs is a result of costs
incurred to widen the Company s product range, as well as the employment of
additional design and development resources.

Bad Debt Expense (Recovery)      Bad Debt Expense
(Recovery) for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
($6,341) and $78,775, respectively. This 108% decrease in Bad Debt Expense
(Recovery) is primarily the result of the write off of a portion of
unrecoverable debt owed to Two Eleven during the 2015 compared period. 
  General and Administrative Expenses    General and
administrative expenses consist of insurance, travel, merchant fees, telephone,
office and computer supplies. General and administrative expenses for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,466,992 and
$1,349,849, respectively. The 9% increase in general and administrative expenses
is primarily as a result of increased travel expenditures required in the
development of the Company s growing product range as well as in order to
continue the activation of the Company s global merchandising and event
presence.  
  Depreciation Expense      Depreciation Expense for
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $314,584 and

Company s widening product range. 
  Total Operating Expenses    Total operating expenses
increased by $242,885, to $6.8 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2016, or 4%, compared to $6.6 million in the 2015 period. This increase is
primarily due to increased research and development, advertising and marketing
and travel costs that were partially offset by decreased professional fees
discussed above.  
  Net income    The net income after income taxes for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $140,780 as opposed to a net
income after income taxes of $657,008 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. This decrease in net income is primarily due to the decreased revenues
discussed above.  
 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 
 At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$0.95 million and $0.06 million of short-term investments. The following table
sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:  

Cash decreased by $101,332, or 10%, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The primary sources of cash for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were a net income of $140,780 and decreased prepaid expenses
and other assets of $578,386. The primary uses of cash for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were increased accounts receivable of $343,125, payments in
advance of $ 323,623, and the repayment of a short-term loan amounting to
$620,003. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any credit facilities or
significant amounts owed to third party lenders.  
 The Company is currently meeting its working capital needs
through cash on hand as well as internally generated cash from operations.
Management believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances, along
with the net cash generated by operations are sufficient to meet its anticipated
operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. There are
currently no plans for any major capital expenditures in the next twelve months.
Our long-term financing requirements depend on our growth strategy, which
relates primarily to our desire to increase revenue both domestically as well as
internationally.

  Critical Accounting Policies  
 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. We have identified the following as the items that
require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation:
revenue recognition, estimating allowances for doubtful accounts receivable,
inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets and accounting for income
taxes. 
   Revenue and Cost Recognition    - All manufacturing
of Leatt-Brace products is performed by third party subcontractors in China. The
Company's products are sold worldwide to a global network of distributors and
dealers, and directly to consumers when there are no dealers or distributors in
their geographic area (collectively the "customers"). Revenues from product
sales are recognized when earned, net of applicable provisions for discounts and
returns and allowances in the event of product defect. Revenue is considered to
be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:
title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable
and collectability is reasonably assured. Our distributor payment terms range
from pre-payment in full to 60 days after shipment and subsequent sales of our products by distributors have no effect on the amount and
timing of payments due to us. Furthermore, products purchased by distributors
may not be returned to us in the event that any such distributor relationship is
terminated.  
 - 18 - 

Since the Company (through its wholly owned subsidiary) serves
as the distributor of Leatt products in the United States, the Company records
its revenue and related cost of revenue for its product sales in the United
States upon shipment of the merchandise to the dealer or to the ultimate
consumer when there is no dealer in the geographic area and the sales order was
received directly from, and paid by, the ultimate consumer. Since the Company
(through its South African branch) serves as the distributor of Leatt products
in South Africa, the Company records its revenue and related cost of revenue for
its product sales in South Africa upon shipment of the merchandise from the
branch to the dealer. International sales (other than in South Africa) are
generally drop-shipped directly from the third party manufacturer to the
international distributors. 
 Revenue and related cost of revenue is recognized at the time
of shipment from the manufacturer's port when the shipping terms are Free On
Board ("FOB") shipping point. Cost and Freight ("CFR") or Cost and Insurance to
named place ("CIP") as legal title and risk of loss to the product pass to the
distributor. Sales to all customers (distributors, dealers and consumers) are
generally final; however, in limited instances, product may be returned due to
product quality issues. Historically, returns due to product quality issues have
not been material and there have been no distributor terminations that resulted
in product returns. Cost of revenues also includes royalty fees associated with
sales of Leatt-Brace products. Product royalty income is recorded as the
underlying product sales occur, in accordance with the related licensing
arrangements. 
   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable  -  Accounts receivable consist of amounts due to the Company from normal
business activities. Credit is granted to substantially all distributors on an
unsecured basis. We continuously monitor collections and payments from customers
and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been
identified. In determining the amount of the allowance, we are required to make
certain estimates and assumptions. Accounts receivable balances that are still
outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off as
uncollectible. While such credit losses have historically been minimal, within
our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we
will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past.
A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our
significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability
of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  
   Inventory Valuation     Inventory is stated at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO)
method. Inventory consists primarily of finished goods. Shipping and handling
costs are included in the cost of inventory. In assessing the inventory value,
we make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product
obsolescence, aging of inventory and other issues potentially affecting the
saleable condition of products. In performing such evaluations, we utilize
historical experience as well as current market information. The reserve for
obsolescence as of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$186,899 and $367,587, respectively.  
   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets       Our
long-lived assets include property and equipment. We evaluate our long-lived
assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that an asset may be impaired. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we
estimate the future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset and
eventual disposition. If the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than
the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, equal to the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, is recognized. We have
determined there was no impairment charge during the nine months  ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   Income Taxes   - As part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our
income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit)
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment
of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance
sheets. We regularly evaluate our ability to recover the reported amount of our
deferred income taxes considering several factors, including our estimate of the
likelihood of the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years
during the period over which the temporary differences reverse.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 See Note 8,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial statements for a full description of recent
accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption, or
expected adoption and effects of our consolidated financial position, results of
operation and cash flows.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 As of September 30, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to its stockholders. 
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK.   
 Not Applicable.  
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s management, under the
direction of its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, Mr.
Sean Macdonald, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our SEC
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based
upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer determined that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
deemed to be effective.    
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
  
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during the period ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 
  PART II     OTHER INFORMATION     
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits
and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Other than as set
forth below, we are currently not aware of any legal proceedings the ultimate
outcome of which, in our judgment based on information currently available,
would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
operating results.  

On February 25, 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the Company on behalf of
  a motorcycle rider in the Northern District Court of Indiana, Lafayette
  Division for strict liability, breach of warranty, negligence, punitive
  damages and deceptive and misleading advertising and marketing. The litigation
  is at discovery stage and the trial is currently scheduled to commence October
  30, 2017. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends
  to vigorously defend itself.  
   
   On August 24, 2016, Simpson Performance Products, Inc., a Texas
  corporation, filed a lawsuit against the Company and other defendants in the
  United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina,
  alleging that the Company s head and neck restraint products, including the
  Leatt  MRX Pro head and neck restraint, is directly and/or indirectly
  infringing on the scope of its patent. Simpson is seeking to enjoin the
  Company from using the products and/or an award of compensatory damages in an
  yet undetermined amount, but no less than a reasonable royalty. The litigation
  is in the initial stage and no hearing date has yet been set. The Company
  believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend
  itself.    
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.   
 There are no material changes from the risk factors previously
disclosed in Item 1A  Risk Factors  of our annual report on Form 10-K for the
period ended December 31, 2015.
