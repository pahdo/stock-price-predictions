CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT RELATED TO FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
Periodic Report on Form 10Q (this  Report ) contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking
statements may include words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   intend, 
 could,   should,   would,   may,   seek,   plan,   might, 
 will,   expect,   predict,   project,   forecast,   potential, 
 continue  negatives thereof or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are found at various places
throughout this Report and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations; business strategies;
future cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future operations, future
cash needs, business plans and future financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.  

From
time to time, forward-looking statements also are included in our other periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, in our press releases,
in our presentations, on our website and in other materials released to the public.  Any or all of the forward-looking
statements included in this Report and in any other reports or public statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance
and may turn out to be inaccurate. These forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions
and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors.  Many of those factors are
outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking
statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might
not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report. All subsequent written and oral
forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Report and attributable to us or any person acting on our
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report.  

Except
to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
otherwise.  

To
Our Shareholders    

The
future of our Corporation has always been our key priority and at the core of our considerations from the start of the Corporation.
From quarter to quarter we reassess our positioning in our different markets with each of our distributors and agents we have
nationally and internationally, thereafter we take the decisions we deemed the most accurate for the Corporation to gradually
improve its results and achieve growth within the medium term. The technological advances we have achieved over the past years
in our Needle-Free jet injector market segment firmly places us as the most advanced devices on the market combining speed, regulated
pressure, dosage/volume adjustability and accuracy to produce the most efficient method of drug delivery.  

From
the start of our business and to facilitate its rapid market penetration MIT is developing strategic alliances with distributors
and agents per Country that have established a successful distribution network in each of the niche market where MIT products
can be sold. MIT has developed, during the past several years, distribution networks in a few countries. MIT selects its distributors
with the goal of building long-term relationships to ensure the success of MIT s Needle-Free Injectors.  

In
our last year end financials (2015) we explained the benefits and the disadvantages of such a business model working with distributors.
 The disadvantages are when the distributor for different reasons being political, economical or personnel could not perform
as expected resulting in loss of sales and profits.   

We
continue to believe that our marketing policy and strategy this year and in the future is to continue the search for distributors
in different markets with the following criteria in place to become an MIT distributor:  

Financial
                                         stability.    

Strong
                                         management.    

Strong
                                         marketing and sales team.    

Understanding
                                         MIT technologies and have a medical team.    

A
                                         strong technical support team.    

We
continue to believe the importance of providing adequate support to our distributors as we expand our network in order to increases
sales. The Company could not establish an internal marketing representative to provide support for its distributors for financial
reasons; the management and the operation director has regularly assisted our network of distributors in their marketing activities
by training the distributor s sales representatives via video-conferences, providing support for after-sales service, making
regular visits, be present at certain important national and international exhibitions or presentations to potential buyers. In
addition, MIT s main priority has and always will be its customer satisfaction.  

MIT s
marketing and sales strategies in the medium and long term are the following:  

Conduct
                                         more trials with renowned doctors to respond to new needs in the medical community.    

Hire
                                         and train qualified marketing representatives with international experiences.    

Searching
                                         for new dynamic and experience distributors worldwide.    

New
products in 2015.   

MIT
introduced in the second and third quarter of 2015 two new products:  

1.    MED-JET
                                         MIT H-4 tageted all vaccination clinics, hospitals, and many other departments that had
                                         needs for single use disposable cartridge biologic injections.    

2.    MINI-JET
                                         for day old chick vaccination in hatcheries.    

The
                                         first new product MED-JET MIT H-4 was used in different markets for human vaccination
                                         and other medications in different countries including Africa, Asia and the Middle East.    

The
                                         second new product MINI-JET was introduced in different markets for day old chick s
                                         vaccination in different countries including USA, Canada, Europe, Africa, Asia and the
                                         Middle East.    

These
two new products should help the Company increase its sales with our existing distributors and new potential agent and distributors
in different countries that are in negotiation for a potential agreement.

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Medical International Technology, Inc. ( MIT 
or the  Company ) and its subsidiary (collectively referred to as the  Company ) have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These
financial statements do not include all information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America for complete financial statements. It is recommended that these interim unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the nine month periods ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results which may be expected for any other interim periods or for the year ending September 30, 2016. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Going
concern  

There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that
funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional
capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force
the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business.
Further, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they
will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders.  

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note
2   Inventories   

Inventories
at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 consist of the following:   

Note
3   Property and Equipment   

The
cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 5 to 7 years.
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and on the declining balance method for
income tax reporting purposes. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $58,308 and $47,674,
respectively.

Business
Development   

Expanding
the product line:  

Medical
International Technology Inc. ( MIT or the  Company ) has been expanding financial resources in R D in the
last 5 years. MIT already has 5 products for the human market and 9 products for the animal market. The company has unveiled two
new additions one for the human line and one for its animal line to our distributors.  

MIT s
patented technology has received approval in several countries worldwide. The Company expects that the two new products will be
no exception.  

The
Company has decided not to put any physical nor financial effort at this time in pursuing its efforts for the FDA certification
and will resume its effort in fiscal year 2017/2018.  

The
Company has decided to put more effort in its existing products and existing market for the next three quarters and the year 2016/2017,
in order to better consolidate and serve our existing Distributor.  

Projected
Sales and Market Breakdown   

The
following information will outline market expectations by category and timeframe:  

Human
applications:  

The
Company has decided for the next three quarters and the year 2016/2017 to put more effort in expanding our cosmetic dermatology,
plastic surgery, podiatry market, it will do so through the use of the Med-Jet models MIT MBX, MIT-H-III and the MESO-JET.  

Animal
applications:  

The
Company has decided for the next three quarters and the year 2016/2017 to put more effort in expanding the pork, cattle, and poultry
markets, using our existing products for mass animal vaccination.   

China
Joint Venture  

The
creation of MIT China in June of 2009 has given MIT a unique advantage to expand its production operations and increase its sales
and profits in the multi-billion dollar worldwide needle-free injector market. Furthermore, MIT China venture will help MIT supply
large production volumes in lesser time, which will attract large medical and pharmaceutical partners.  

The
introduction of our Agro-Jet needle-free injector for animal application is progressing well; our veterinary staff has been successfully
job training our distributors in various regions. We expect that these efforts will result in sales growth for the coming fiscal
quarters and years.  

During
the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, MIT China purchased 151,000 sq. ft. of land and began construction of their first building
in Taizhou (China Medical City). This first building of 40,000 sq. ft. when finalized will be used for the production of injectors
for the Chinese market only.  

The
work in progress at MIT China for the construction of its 40,000 sq. ft. building is expected to be completed and certified by
the Chinese SFDA by March 2014. We will start planning and purchasing much of the equipment and tools necessary for the assembly
and production of some of our Agro-Jet and Med-Jet products. The production facility should be able to supply a large number of
injectors and disposables to the Chinese market.  

Per
the recent discussions and understanding of our general manager, Ethan Sun, with our Joint Venture partner, our plan of sales
and expansion into the Chinese market is progressing and MIT China agreed and sold 9% of their joint venture for an investment
of 18,000,000 RMB (US$3,000,000). MIT China now has 46.41%, we have 44.59%, and Taizhou Amazon Investment Center has 9% ownership
in such venture.  

Our
objective is to ensure that our injectors become an indispensable and environmentally friendly product for doctors, dentists,
veterinarians and home users around the world.  

We
will continue providing a safe and effective means to help prevent the spread of deadly diseases to both humans and animals through
the use of the Med-Jet  and Agro-Jet  needle-free injection system.

Plan
of Operations   

Medical
International Technology's intends to concentrate its activities in the medical and veterinary sectors, in particular, in the
field of equipment and instrumentation. The company's strategy is to build good, reliable and cost effective products, seek and
establish strategic alliances with different pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to ensure good distribution channels for
its products.  

MIT
promotes and sells products in over 30 countries including the United States of America. MIT is exerting every effort and using
its resources to promote its products and to open markets for its technology. As we continue to market our products, we hope to
gain broader acceptance of the needle-free injection technology. MIT is continually researching and developing its products to
the market needs.  

We
will continue to seek additional funding to expand operations and develop sales revenue to a volume sufficient to sustain operations
and increase shareholders value.  

Product
Development   

Per
our previous fillings for FDA approval for our needle-free injector, the MED-JET is designed specifically for mass human inoculations.
The MED-JET is capable of delivering many types of medications such as vaccines, insulin and other types of injectables. Its low-pressure
technology offers an advantage to alternative high pressure systems that can cause blowbacks and expose medical workers and patients
alike to microscopic traces of blood.  

According
to the International Sharps Injury Prevention Society (http://www.isips.org), it has been estimated that one out of every seven
workers is accidentally struck by a contaminated sharp point each and every year. The Center for Disease Control (CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/2000-108.html#5)
estimates that there are 600,000 to 800,000 needle stick injuries per year in the U.S. alone, and many are not reported. More
than 20 types of infectious agents have been transmitted through needlesticks, including hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, syphilis,
malaria, herpes, diphtheria, gonorrhea, typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The MED-JET will eliminate this risk to health
care professionals and create a safer workplace. Other advantages include its light weight (0.5 kg) and an excellent medication
absorption rate. Additionally, the system has the ability to increase or decrease the volume and pressure of injection. This technology
is unique to MIT s MED-JET MBX Injector. The system is designed to inject up to 600 individuals an hour.  

The
approval process can be expensive and may take an extended period of time. There can be no assurance that this system will receive
approval from the FDA or if approved gain broad acceptance by the medical community or individual patients.  

MIT's
Needle-Free Injection System, designed specifically to allow fast, accurate and safe injections, is rapidly moving toward establishing
itself as a valuable instrument in the fight against disease in both humans and animals. Spurred on by growing fears of a worldwide
epidemic that could match or even exceed the deadly flu pandemic of 1918 which killed millions of people, the MIT team is focusing
its efforts to make its Needle-Free Injection System available to the world.  

MIT
will increasingly promote its Agro-Jet needle-free injector. Having the same benefits as Med-Jet, Agro-Jet will become a valuable
instrument in the fight against Avian Flu via its ability to mass inoculate animals at over 1000 injections per hour.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation,
with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )

of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to lack of timely filing to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
