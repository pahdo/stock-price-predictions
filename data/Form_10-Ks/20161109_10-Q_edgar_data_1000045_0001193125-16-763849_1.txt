 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
 (Unaudited)     1. Basis of Presentation   
 The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the accompanying unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements of Nicholas Financial, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended in Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to ensure the information is not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017. It is suggested
that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 14, 2016. The March 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet included herein has been derived from the March 31, 2016 audited consolidated balance sheet included in the aforementioned
Form 10-K.    The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables and the fair value of interest rate swap
agreements.     2. Revenue Recognition     Finance
receivables consist of automobile finance installment contracts ( Contracts ) and direct consumer loans ( Direct Loans ). Interest income on finance receivables is recognized using the interest method. Accrual of interest income
on finance receivables is suspended when a loan enters bankruptcy status, is contractually delinquent for 60 days or more or the collateral is repossessed, whichever is earlier. Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts are accounted for under the
cost-recovery method. Interest income on Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts does not resume until all principal amounts are recovered (see Note 4).    A dealer
discount represents the difference between the finance receivable, net of unearned interest, of a Contract, and the amount of money the Company actually pays for the Contract. The discount negotiated by the Company is a function of the lender, the
wholesale value of the vehicle and competition in any given market. In making decisions regarding the purchase of a particular Contract the Company considers the following factors related to the borrower: place and length of residence; current and
prior job status; history in making installment payments for automobiles; current income; and credit history. In addition, the Company examines its prior experience with Contracts purchased from the dealer from which the Company is purchasing the
Contract, and the value of the automobile in relation to the purchase price and the term of the Contract. The entire amount of discount is amortized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method over the life of the loan. The average dealer
discount associated with new volume for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 7.01% and 7.57%, respectively in relation to the total amount financed. The average dealer discount associated with new volume for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 7.08% and 7.55%, respectively.    The amount of future unearned income is computed as the product of the Contract
rate, the Contract term and the Contract amount.    Deferred revenues consist primarily of commissions received from the sale of ancillary products. These
products include automobile warranties, roadside assistance programs, accident and health insurance, credit life insurance, involuntary unemployement insurance coverage, and forced placed automobile insurance. These commissions are amortized over
the life of the contract using the interest method.    The Company s net costs for originating Direct Loans are deferred and recognized as an
adjustment to the yield and are amortized over the life of the loan using the interest method.

   3. Earnings Per Share   
 The Company has granted stock compensation awards with nonforfeitable dividend rights which are considered participating securities. As such, earnings per
share is calculated using the two-class method. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, which excludes the
participating securities. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares from stock compensation awards. Earnings per share have been computed based on the following weighted average number of common
shares outstanding:      
   Diluted earnings per share do not include the effect of certain stock options as their impact would be anti-dilutive. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, potential shares of common stock from stock options totaling 160,000 and 160,217, respectively, were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect is
anti-dilutive. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, potential shares of common stock from stock options totaling 162,486 and 157,623, respectively, were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because their
effect is anti-dilutive.

   4. Finance Receivables (continued)   
   
  The Company purchases Contracts from automobile dealers at a negotiated price that is less than the original
principal amount being financed by the purchaser of the automobile. The Contracts are predominately for used vehicles. As of September 30, 2016, the average model year of vehicles collateralizing the portfolio was a 2008 vehicle. The Company
utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance. If the allowance for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool, then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to maintain adequate reserves
based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the portfolio, and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, considers among other matters, the estimated net realizable value of the underlying
collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for credit losses.  
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on Direct Loans:  
   
   Direct Loans are originated directly between the Company and the consumer. These loans are typically for amounts ranging from
$1,000 to $9,000 and are generally secured by a lien on an automobile, watercraft or other permissible tangible personal property. The majority of Direct Loans are originated with current or former customers under the Company s automobile
financing program. The typical Direct Loan represents a significantly better credit risk than our typical Contract due to the customer s historical payment history with the Company. In deciding whether or not to make a loan, the Company
considers the individual s credit history, job stability, income and impressions created during a personal interview with a Company loan officer. Additionally, because most of Direct Loans made by the Company to date have been made to borrowers
under Contracts previously purchased by the Company, the payment history of the borrower under the Contract is a significant factor in making the loan decision. As of September 30, 2016, loans made by the Company pursuant to its Direct Loan
program constituted approximately 2% of the aggregate principal amount of the Company s loan portfolio. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for both Contracts and Direct Loans were driven by current economic conditions and trends over
several reporting periods which are useful in estimating future losses and overall portfolio performance.    A performing account is defined as an account
that is less than 61 days past due. A non-performing account is defined as an account that is contractually delinquent for 61 days or more and the accrual of interest income is suspended. As of September 2016, when an account is 180 days
contractually delinquent, the account is written off. This change aligns the Company s charge-off policy with best practices within the subprime auto financing segment, and had an immaterial impact on losses absorbed and the allowance for
credit losses. See Item 2 for more discussion. Prior to September 2016, accounts that were 120 days contractually delinquent were written off. Upon notification of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, an account is monitored for collection with other
Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts. In the event the debtors balance has been reduced by the bankruptcy court, the Company will record a loss equal to the amount of principal balance reduction. The remaining balance will be reduced as payments are
received by the bankruptcy court. In the event an account is dismissed from bankruptcy, the Company will decide, based on several factors, to begin repossession proceedings or to allow the customer to begin making regularly scheduled payments.

   4. Finance Receivables (continued)   
   
  The following table is an assessment of the credit quality by creditworthiness:  
   
   The following tables present certain information regarding the delinquency rates experienced by the Company with respect to
Contracts and under its Direct Loans, excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts:      
    5. Line of Credit     The
Company has a line of credit facility (the  Line ) up to $225.0 million The pricing of the Line, which expires on January 30, 2018, is 300 basis points above 30-day LIBOR with a 1% floor on LIBOR (4.00% at September 30, 2016
and March 31, 2016). Pledged as collateral for this Line are all of the assets of the Company. The outstanding amount of the Line was $209.0 million and $211.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. The
amount available under the Line was $16.0 million and $14.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.    The facility
requires compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests, including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in full compliance with all
debt covenants.     6. Interest Rate Swap Agreements   
 The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in expected cash flows attributable to interest rate risk. The interest
rate swap agreements convert a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate, more closely matching the interest rate characteristics of finance receivables.  
 As of the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no new contracts were initiated and no contracts matured.

   6. Interest Rate Swap Agreements (continued)   
   
  The Company currently has two interest rate swap agreements. A June 4, 2012 interest rate swap agreement
provides for a five-year interest rate swap in which the Company pays a fixed rate of 1% and receives payments from the counterparty on the 1-month LIBOR rate. This interest rate swap agreement had an effective date of June 13, 2012 and a
notional amount of $25.0 million. A July 30, 2012 agreement provides for a five-year interest rate swap in which the Company pays a fixed rate of 0.87% and receives payments from the counterparty on the 1-month LIBOR rate. This interest rate
swap agreement had an effective date of August 13, 2012 and a notional amount of $25.0 million.    The locations and amounts of losses in income are as
follows:      
   Net realized losses from the interest rate swap agreements were recorded in the interest expense line item of the consolidated
statements of income. The following table summarizes the average variable rates received and average fixed rates paid under the swap agreements.      
    7. Income Taxes     The
provision for income taxes decreased to approximately $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate decreased
to 37.61% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 38.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The provision for income taxes decreased to approximately $3.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from
approximately $4.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate decreased to 38.03% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from 38.44% for the six months ended September 30, 2015.

   8. Fair Value Disclosures   
 The Company measures specific assets and liabilities at fair value, which is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When applicable, the Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability under a
three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in
active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  
  Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   
 The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swap agreements based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward
interest rate yield curve in effect as of the measurement period, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any, including a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of both the Company s credit risk and the counterparty s credit risk.
Accordingly, the Company classifies interest rate swap agreements as Level 2.      
    Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value   
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, finance receivables and the Line. For each of these financial instruments, the carrying value
approximates fair value.    Finance receivables, net approximates fair value based on the price paid to acquire Contracts. The price paid reflects
competitive market interest rates and purchase discounts for the Company s chosen credit grade in the economic environment. This market is highly liquid as the Company acquires individual loans on a daily basis from dealers. The initial terms
of the Contracts generally range from 12 to 72 months. The initial terms of the Direct Loans generally range from 12 to 60 months. In addition, there have been minimal changes in interest rates and purchase discounts related to these types of loans
due to the competitive nature of the current market. If liquidated outside of the normal course of business, the amount received may not be the carrying value.  
 Based on current market conditions, any new or renewed credit facility would contain pricing that approximates the Company s current Line. Based on these
market conditions, the fair value of the Line as of September 30, 2016 was estimated to be equal to the book value. The interest rate for the Line is a variable rate based on LIBOR pricing options.

   8. Fair Value Disclosures (continued)   

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis   
 The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company does not have any
assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.     9. Contingencies   
 The Company currently is not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business, none of which, if
decided adversely to the Company, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.  
  10. Recently Issued Accounting Standards     In August 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued the Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payment.  The new guidance
focuses on making the Statement of Cash Flows more uniform for companies. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-13  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments . The new guidance requires organizations to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ASU
also requires additional disclosures related to estimates and judgments used to measure all expected credit losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2019. Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on
the consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share- based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities,

   10. Recently Issued Accounting Standards (continued)   

and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  , intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU
affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment.  The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as  lessees  to recognize on the
balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The accounting by organizations that own the assets leased by the lessee also known as lessor accounting  will remain largely unchanged from
current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial
Instruments Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities ,  which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring: equity investments (other than equity method or
consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; separate
presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminating the
requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities; eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant
assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the
portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit ) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in
accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. This ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU permits early adoption
of the instrument-specific credit risk provision. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The ASU requires an entity to
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU, and all subsequently issued clarifying ASUs, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S.
GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU
2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The ASU would permit public entities to adopt the ASU early, but not before the original effective
date (i.e., annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.    The Company does not believe there are any other recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted that will have a
material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Forward-Looking Information    
 This report on Form 10-Q contains various statements, other than those concerning historical information, that are based on management s beliefs and
assumptions, as well as information currently available to management, and should be considered forward-looking statements. This notice is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
with respect to such forward-looking statements. When used in this document, the words  anticipate ,  estimate ,  expect ,  will ,  may ,  believe , and similar expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or
expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the Company s operating results are fluctuations in the economy, the ability to access bank financing, the degree and nature of competition, demand for consumer financing in the
markets served by the Company, the Company s products and services, increases in the default rates experienced on Contracts, adverse regulatory changes in the Company s existing and future markets, the Company s ability to expand its
business, including its ability to complete acquisitions and integrate the operations of acquired businesses, to recruit and retain qualified employees, to expand into new markets and to maintain profit margins in the face of increased pricing
competition. All forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward looking statement. You should also consult
factors described from time to time in the Company s filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and annual reports to shareholders.  
   Litigation and Legal Matters      See  Item 1.
Legal Proceedings  in Part II of this quarterly report below.      Regulatory Developments    
 As previously reported, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which became operational on
July 21, 2011. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products, such as Contracts and the Direct Loans that we offer, including explicit supervisory authority
to examine, audit, and investigate companies offering a consumer financial product such as ourselves. Although the Dodd-Frank Act expressly provides that the CFPB has no authority to establish usury limits, some consumer advocacy groups have
suggested that certain forms of alternative consumer finance products, such as installment loans, should be a regulatory priority and it is possible that at some time in the future the CFPB could propose and adopt rules making such lending or other
products that we may offer materially less profitable or impractical. Further, the CFPB may target specific features of loans by rulemaking that could cause us to cease offering certain products. Any such rules could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The CFPB could also adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to any of our current or future lines of business, which could have a
material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.    In June 2015, the CFPB published a rule expanding their supervision and examination
of non-depository  larger participants  in the automobile finance business, including us. Since we are deemed a larger participant, we are subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB s stated objectives of such
examinations are: to assess the quality of a larger participant s compliance management systems for preventing violations of federal consumer financial laws; to identify acts or practices that materially increase the risk of violations of
federal consumer finance laws and associated harm to consumers; and to gather facts that help determine whether the larger participant engages in acts or practices that are likely to violate federal consumer financial laws in connection with its
automobile finance business. Thus, as a larger participant, we will be subject to examination by the CFPB for compliance with, among other Federal consumer financial laws, the applicable provisions of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA  Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA  Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA  Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
( GLBA  Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA  and, Military Lending Act ( MLA ), as well as, the adequacy of our compliance management system.  
   Critical Accounting Policy      The Company s
critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses. It is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses incurred in the existing portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is
 
      14  

Table of Contents  

established through a provision for credit losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the portfolio and current economic
conditions. Such evaluation considers, among other matters, the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, management s estimate of probable credit losses
and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance.    Because of the nature of the customers under the
Company s Contracts and its Direct Loan program, the Company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative. The Company segregates its Contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for
losses. All Contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool. The Company pools Contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase Contracts in different geographic markets. This method of pooling by
branch and quarter allows the Company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate. The pools also allow the Company to evaluate the different levels of customer income, stability and credit history, and the types of vehicles
purchased, in each market. Each such static pool consists of the Contracts purchased by a branch office during a fiscal quarter.    Contracts are purchased
from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual Contract-by-Contract basis. Individual Contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally the lesser of the applicable state maximum interest rate, if any,
or the maximum interest rate which the customer will accept. In certain markets, competitive forces will drive down Contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual Contract. The Company
purchases Contracts on an individual basis, although the Company may consider portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy.    The Company utilizes
the branch model, which allows for Contract purchasing to be done on the branch level. The Company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which Contracts to purchase. These guidelines are specific and are designed to cause all
of the Contracts that the Company purchases to have common risk characteristics. The Company utilizes its District Managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines. The Company also utilizes
internal audit to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines.    The allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings through the
provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount that reduces the net carrying amount of finance receivables for incurred losses.  
 In analyzing a static pool, the Company considers competition in the market place at the time Contracts are purchased, performance of prior static pools
originated by the same branch office, the performance of prior Contracts purchased from the dealers whose Contracts are included in the current static pool, the credit rating of the customers under the Contracts in the static pool, and current
market and economic conditions. Each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate, and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary.  
   Introduction      Diluted earnings per share decreased
40% to $0.25 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net earnings were $2.0 million and $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Revenue remained relatively flat at $22.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $22.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 For the six months ended September 30, 2016, per share diluted net earnings decreased 30% to $0.62 as compared to $0.89 for the six months ended
September 30, 2015. Net earnings were $4.9 million and $6.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue increased 2% to $45.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
$44.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015.    Our net earnings for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 were
adversely affected primarily by an increase in the provision for credit losses due to higher charge-offs and past-due accounts along with a reduction in the gross portfolio yield. Conversely, our results were favorably impacted due to a change in
the fair value of the interest rate swaps.

   Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015   
   Interest Income and Loan Portfolio      Interest and
fee income on finance receivables, predominately finance charge income, remained flat at $22.6 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Average finance receivables, net of unearned interest
equaled approximately $343.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 2.6% from $334.7 million for the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015. While our purchasing volume has slowed, due to
maintaining our stringent underwriting guidelines, our finance receivables continue to grow in our younger markets, including our two new states (see  Contract Procurement  and  Loan Origination  below). The increase in our
average term and average loan amount has also contributed to increasing our finance receivables. The gross portfolio yield decreased to 26.37% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to 27.11% for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015. The gross portfolio yield decreased primarily due to the decrease in the average dealer discount and a decrease in the average weighted APR, both of which are primarily the result of increased competition for Contracts
across all markets. The net portfolio yield decreased to 14.28% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from 17.01% for the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015. The net portfolio yield decreased due to a decrease in
the gross portfolio yield and an increase in the provision for credit losses (see  Analysis of Credit Losses ).      Marketing, Salaries,
Employee Benefits, Depreciation, Administrative, and Professional Fee Expenses      Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation,
administrative, and professional fee expenses increased to approximately $9.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $8.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase was
primarily related to an increase in costs associated with maintaining the finance receivable portfolio. Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, administrative, and professional fee expenses as a percentage of finance receivables, net
of unearned interest, increased to 10.74% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from 10.59% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015.  
   Interest Expense      Interest expense remained
relatively flat at approximately $2.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $2.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The following table summarizes the Company s average cost of
borrowed funds:      
   The Company s average cost of funds decreased mainly due to interest rate swap agreements not increasing proportionately
to total average debt, $208.5 million as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $207.4 million September 30, 2015. LIBOR rates have increased (.53% as of September 30, 2016 compared to .19% as of September 30, 2015), which has
caused the credit spread to decrease and the variable interest to increase but this increase had no effect on total cost because there is a a 1.0% floor on the Line.  
 The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements was $50.0 million at a weighted average fixed rate of 0.94% for each of the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. For further discussions regarding the effect of interest rate swap agreements see Note 6    Interest Rate Swap Agreements .

which are primarily the result of increased competition. The net portfolio yield decreased to 15.09% for the six-month period ended September 30, 2016 from 17.66% for the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015. The net portfolio
yield decreased due to a decrease in the gross portfolio yield and an increase in the provision for credit losses (see  Analysis of Credit Losses ).  
   Marketing, Salaries, Employee Benefits, Depreciation, Administrative, and Professional Fee Expenses    
 Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, administrative, and professional fee expenses increased to approximately $18.1 million for the six-month
period ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $17.7 million for the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily related to an increase in costs associated with maintaining the finance receivable
portfolio. Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, administrative, and professional fee expenses as a percentage of finance receivables, net of unearned interest, decreased to 10.57% for the six-month period ended September 30,

     Analysis of Credit Losses    
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 1,500 active static pools. The average pool upon inception consisted of 60 Contracts with
aggregate finance receivables, net of unearned interest, of approximately $678,000.    The provision for credit losses increased to approximately $8.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in the net charge-off rate to 9.36% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from 8.03% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The provision for credit losses increased to approximately $15.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $11.2
million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in the net charge-off rate to 8.43% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from 6.95% for the six months ended September 30,
2015.    The Company s losses as a percentage of liquidation (see note 5 in the Portfolio Summary for the definition of write-off to liquidation)
increased to 11.41% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 9.64% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s losses as a percentage of liquidation increased to 10.42% for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to 8.34% for the six months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of increased competition in all markets in which the Company presently operates as well as lower resale value at
auto auctions. Increased competition continues to drive a higher percentage of loans acquired that are categorized in the lower tiers of the Company s guidelines as well as longer terms. Decreased auction proceeds from repossessed vehicles
increased the amount of write-offs which, in turn, increased the write-off to liquidation percentage. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately 37%
and 43%, respectively, of the related principal balance. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately 38% and 44%, respectively, of the related principal
balance.    Recoveries as a percentage of charge-offs were approximately 6.98% and 9.52% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Recoveries as a percentage of charge-offs were approximately 7.82% and 8.34% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company attributes a large portion of this decrease simply to the increase in
charge-offs; however, there was also a decrease in the dollars received through our recovery department. Historically, recoveries fluctuate from period to period due to various factors. The increase in competition hinders our ability to collect
deficiency balances. Many customers may not be concerned currently about blemished credit histories due to many competitors with less restrictive underwriting guidelines. From time to time, the Company will aggregate charge-off accounts it deems
uncollectible, and sell them to a third-party.    The delinquency percentage for Contracts more than thirty days past due, excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy
accounts, as of September 30, 2016 increased to 9.76% from 5.88% as of September 30, 2015. The delinquency percentage for Direct Loans more than thirty days past due as of September 30, 2016 increased to 4.09% from 1.80% as of
September 30, 2015. Also, see the  Future Outlook  section for more discussion on loan operations and collections. See Note 4-  Finance Receivables  for changes in allowance for credit losses, credit quality and
delinquencies. The delinquency percentage increase for Contracts reflects portfolio weakness that generally manifests itself in increased future losses. The Company has continued to see a significant increase in the number of competitors with
aggressive underwriting in our operating market.

Table of Contents  

  The Company considers the following factors to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels:
unemployment rates; competition; the number of bankruptcy filings; the results of internal branch audits; consumer sentiment; consumer spending; economic growth (i.e., changes in GDP); the condition of the housing sector; and other leading economic
indicators. The Company continues to evaluate reserve levels on a pool-by-pool basis during each reporting period. The longer-term outlook for portfolio performance will depend on overall economic conditions, the unemployment rate, the rational or
irrational behavior of the Company s competitors, and the Company s ability to monitor, manage and implement its underwriting philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion.  
 In accordance with our policies and procedures, certain borrowers qualify for, and the Company offers, one-month principal payment deferrals on Contracts and
Direct Loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company granted deferrals to approximately 5.60% and 6.22%, respectively, of total Contracts and Direct Loans. For the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company granted deferrals to approximately 11.02% and 11.47%, respectively, of total Contracts and Direct Loans. The number of deferrals is influenced by portfolio performance, including but
not limited to, the unemployment rate, inflation, credit quality of loans purchased, and general economic conditions.      Income Taxes    
 The provision for income taxes decreased to approximately $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $2.0 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate decreased to 37.61% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 38.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The provision for income
taxes decreased to approximately $3.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $4.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate decreased to 38.03% for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 from 38.44% for the six months ended September 30, 2015.      Liquidity and Capital Resources    
 The Company s cash flows are summarized as follows:      
   The Company s primary use of working capital during the six months ended September 30, 2016, was the funding of the
purchase of Contracts which are financed substantially through cash from principal payments received and cash from operations. The Line is secured by all of the assets of the Company and has a maturity date of January 31, 2018. The Company may
borrow up to $225.0 million. Borrowings under the Line may be under various LIBOR pricing options plus 300 basis points with a 1% floor on LIBOR. As of September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding under the Line was $209.0 million, and the amount
available under the Line was approximately $16.0 million.    The Company will continue to depend on the availability of the Line, together with cash from
operations, to finance future operations. Amounts outstanding under the Line have decreased by $2.0 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease of the Line is principally related to the fact that cash received from
operations exceeded cash needed to fund new contracts. The amount of debt the Company incurs from time to time under these financing mechanisms depends on the Company s need for cash and ability to borrow under the terms of the Line. The
Company believes that borrowings available under the Line as well as cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term funding needs. The Line requires compliance with certain debt covenants including financial ratios, asset
quality and other performance tests. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of September 30, 2016.

    Contractual Obligations    
 The following table summarizes the Company s material obligations as of September 30, 2016.  

1. 
 The Company s Line matures on January 30, 2018. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Line as of September 30, 2016, is based on an effective interest rate of 4.28% which includes the estimated
effect of the interest rate swap agreements settlements through the maturity date. The effective interest rate used in the above table does not contemplate the possibility of entering into interest rate swap agreements in the future.
       Future Outlook      The Company
currently (as of November 9, 2016) operates a total of 65 branch locations in eighteen states (see  Contract Procurement ). The Company consolidated three branch locations (Sarasota, FL, Troy, MI, and Toledo, OH) into branches
previously established within their market, and opened a full service branch in Pittsburgh during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company continues to evaluate potential new markets while maintaining its existing markets. The
Company may choose to close or consolidate certain existing branches if they are unable to acquire Contracts that meet Company expectations. As a result of continued intense competition, the Company has been evaluating the long-term sustainability
of its current branch-based model. Also, as previously disclosed, effective October 1, 2016, the Company has moved all loan-servicing operations, including collections, from the branch locations to a centralized location within its Corporate
Headquarters in Clearwater, FL. New regulations and best practices regarding collections were important aspects that led us to the decision to centralize our loan servicing operations. To a lesser extent the Company expects to experience a decline
in operating expenses as a result of a reduced headcount. The Company does not believe there will be any material change in delinquencies and losses as a result of this strategic decision, however no assurances can be given at this time. The
branches will continue to underwrite and acquire Contracts; however, any additional material changes to Company operations will be evaluated by the Company over the next several quarters. We continue to evaluate the various markets in which we
operate; however, we do not expect any significant changes to the number of branches or other operations during our third quarter ending December 31, 2016.  
    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 Market risks relating to the Company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged
transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.      Interest rate risk    
 Management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Derivative financial instruments,
such as interest rate swap agreements, may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations. The Company does not use interest rate swap agreements for speculative purposes. As of
September 30, 2016, $159 million, or approximately 76.1% of our total debt, was subject to floating interest rates; however, due to a 1% floor on the debt these rates are effectively fixed until the variable rates exceed this threshold. As a
result, a hypothetical increase in the variable interest rates of 1% or 100 basis points (1.53% as of September 30, 2016) applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after-tax increase of interest expense of approximately
$370,000.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure
 
      22  

Table of Contents  

controls and procedures, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the date of such evaluation to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q was being prepared.     Changes in internal controls . There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION       
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     The Company currently is not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation
incidental to its business, none of which, if decided adversely to the Company, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.  
    ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016,
which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the
Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
