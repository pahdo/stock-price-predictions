   BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation   
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   
  1. Organization     BlackRock Capital
Investment Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ), was organized as a Delaware corporation on April 13, 2005 and was initially funded on July 25, 2005. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business
development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  1940 Act ). In addition, for tax purposes the Company has qualified and has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC )
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the  Code ).    The Company s investment objective is to generate both current income
and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company invests primarily in middle-market companies in the form of senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans, each of which may include an equity component,
and by making direct preferred, common and other equity investments in such companies.     2. Significant accounting policies   
   Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements    
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ). The Company is an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 946,
 Financial Services-Investment Company  ( ASC 946 ).    Certain financial information that is normally included in annual
financial statements, including certain financial statement footnotes, prepared in accordance with GAAP, is not required for interim reporting purposes and has been condensed or omitted herein. These consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 11, 2016.    The interim financial information at September 30, 2016 and for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited. However, in the opinion of management, the interim information includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s results for
the periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.  
   Basis of Presentation    
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other
parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ and such differences could be material.    The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which were established to hold certain investments of the Company. The Company owns 100% of each subsidiary and, as such, the subsidiaries are
consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements. The subsidiaries hold investments which are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes. By investing through these 100% owned subsidiaries, the Company is able to benefit
from corporate tax treatment for these entities and thereby create a tax structure that is more advantageous with respect to the RIC status of the Company. Transactions between the Company and subsidiaries, to the extent they occur, are eliminated
in consolidation.

  Expenses are recorded on an accrual basis.  
   Investments    
 Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date unless there are substantial conditions to the purchase. Realized gains or losses
are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded
unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are calculated using the specific identification method.  
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair
value. The Company obtains market quotations, when available, from an independent pricing service or one or more broker-dealers or market makers and utilizes the average of the range of bid and ask quotations. Debt and equity securities for which
market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Company s Board of Directors.  
 Because the Company expects that there will not be a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in its portfolio, the
Company expects to value substantially all of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with a documented
valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the
Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize.  
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of the
Company s investments than on the fair values of the Company s investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where BlackRock
Advisors, LLC, the Company s investment advisor (the  Advisor ), believes that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not
reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a  forced  sale by a distressed seller, where
market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread.  
 With respect to the Company s investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed
not to represent fair value, the Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process applied each quarter, as described below:  
 (i) The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment
professionals of the Advisor responsible for the portfolio investment;    (ii) The investment professionals provide recent portfolio company
financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms engaged by the Board of Directors, such firms conduct independent appraisals each quarter and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with
senior management of the Advisor;    (iii) The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations prepared by the
independent valuation firms; and    (iv) The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the
portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Advisor, the respective independent valuation firms and the Audit Committee.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market
quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions
involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is
based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Company may take into account in determining the fair value of its investments include, as relevant
and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the
nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, (e.g. non-performance risk), its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of
financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, the Company s principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values.  
 Until the end of the second calendar quarter following its acquisition, each unquoted investment in a new portfolio company generally is held
at amortized cost, which the Advisor believes approximates fair value under the circumstances. As of that date, an independent valuation firm conducts an initial independent appraisal of the investment.  
 ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820-10 ), issued by the FASB, defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. See Note 10 for further details.      Cash
and Cash Equivalents      Cash equivalents include short-term liquid overnight investments with original maturities of three months or
less and may not be insured by the FDIC or may exceed federally insured limits.      Revenue recognition    
 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes amortization of discounts and accretion of premiums. Discounts and premiums to
par value on securities purchased are amortized/accreted into interest income over the life of the respective security. Discounts and premiums are determined based on the cash flows expected to be received for a particular investment upon maturity.
   Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and is adjusted to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts. For
loans and securities with payment-in-kind ( PIK ) income, which represents contractual interest or dividends accrued and added to the principal balance and generally due at maturity, such income is accrued only to the extent that the
Advisor believes that the PIK income is likely to be collected. To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected
the cash.    Fee income, such as structuring fees, origination, closing, commitment and other upfront fees are generally non-recurring and
are recognized as revenue when earned. In instances where the Company does not perform significant services in connection with the related investment, fees paid to the Company may be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the investment.
Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees are recorded as income.  
   U.S. Federal income taxes    
 The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment
applicable to RICs.  
      26  

Table of Contents  

  In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, the Company is required to distribute
annually to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. To avoid federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually at least 98% of our ordinary income and 98.2% of net capital gains from the
current year and any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay regular federal income taxes or a 4%
excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed
taxable income as required.    Distributions from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in
accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, they
are charged or credited to paid-in-capital or accumulated net realized gain (loss), as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of
certain loans and the tax characterization of income and non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Company s annual RIC tax return.  
 Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified among the
Company s capital accounts. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP.  
 The final tax characterization of distributions is determined after the fiscal year and is reported on Form 1099 and in the Company s
annual report to shareholders. Distributions can be characterized as ordinary income, capital gains and/or return of capital. To the extent that distributions exceed the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess may be
treated as a non-taxable return of capital. Distributions that exceed a Company s taxable income but do not exceed the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits, may be classified as ordinary income which is taxable to
shareholders.    ASC 740-10,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740-10 ) clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax position are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Based on its analysis of its tax position, the
Company has concluded that it does not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740-10.  
 The Company files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax returns are currently under examination. The statute of
limitations on the Company s U.S. federal income tax returns remains open for each of the four years ended December 31, 2015. The statute of limitations on the Company s state and local tax returns may remain open for an additional
year depending upon the jurisdiction.    At December 31, 2015, the Company had a net capital loss carryforward of $32,920,297, which can
be used to offset future capital gains. If not utilized against future gains, the entire amount is due to expire on December 31, 2018.  
   Distributions to Common Stockholders    
 Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the
Board of Directors. Net realized capital gains, if any, generally are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.  
 The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of distributions on behalf of stockholders, unless a
stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash distribution, then stockholders who have not  opted out  of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash
dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock, rather than receiving the cash distributions.

    Foreign Currency    
 Foreign currency amounts are translated into United States dollars on the following basis:  

(i) 
 market value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and    

(ii) 
 purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions, income or expenses.    
 Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, the Company does not isolate
that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and
unrealized gain or loss from investments.    Investments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve
certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin, including unanticipated movements in the value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.  
   Debt Issuance Costs    
 Debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt using the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest
rate method.      Equity Offering Expenses    
 The Company records registration expenses related to its shelf registration statement and related SEC filings as prepaid assets. These
expenses are charged as a reduction of capital upon utilization, in accordance with ASC 946.      Non-Accrual Loans    
 Loans or debt securities are placed on non-accrual status, as a general matter, when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or
more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest generally is reversed when a loan or debt security is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans or debt
securities may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual loans and debt securities are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s
judgment, are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.  
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which
changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct reduction of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is
reported as interest expense. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-03 to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements for all outstanding debt, except that incurred under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility (the  Credit Facility ), which the Company will continue to present as an asset on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. In accordance with the transitional provisions of ASU 2015-03, the Company has
reclassified the debt issuance costs for all outstanding debt except that incurred under our Credit Facility, for fiscal year 2015 retrospectively. The debt issuance costs that are now presented as a deduction from the carrying value on the balance
sheet are  
      28  

Table of Contents  

$1,272,724 and $1,923,930 for the respective 2016 and 2015 periods presented. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization of $400,747 and $524,765 related to debt
issuance costs are now presented as interest expense within the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization of $1,239,908 and $1,557,184 related to debt issuance costs are now
presented as interest expense within the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 had no impact on the Company s net asset value.  
  3. Agreements and related party transactions   
   Investment management agreement    
 At a Special Meeting of the Company s Stockholders, held on February 18, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved a new
investment management agreement ( Management Agreement ) between the Company and BlackRock Advisors, LLC to permit the Advisor to serve as the Company s investment adviser following the completion of the sale of certain assets related
to managing the Company from the Company s previous investment adviser, BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC, to the Advisor (the  Transaction ). The Transaction was completed on March 6, 2015 and, pursuant to the new investment
management agreement, dated as of March 6, 2015, the Company s investment activities are currently managed by the Advisor. Prior to the consummation of the Transaction, the Company had entered into an investment management agreement with
BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC, the Company s previous adviser, which is referred to as the  Previous Agreement . The Company s current investment management agreement has the same management and incentive fees as the
Previous Agreement until March 6, 2017 and thereafter will have different management and incentive fees.      Base Management Fee
     Under the current investment management agreement, the Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors,
manages the day-to-day operations and provides the Company with investment advisory services. For providing these services, the Advisor receives, until March 6, 2017, a base management fee at an annual rate of 2.0% of total assets, including
any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage, payable quarterly in arrears. After March 6, 2017, the Advisor will receive a base management fee at an annual rate of 1.75% of total assets (excluding cash), including any assets acquired with
the proceeds of leverage, payable quarterly in arrears based on total asset valuation at the end of the prior quarter.    The investment
management agreement became effective on March 6, 2015. Unless earlier terminated, the investment management agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from
year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of the directors who are not
interested persons.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Advisor earned $5,188,115 and $16,600,294,
respectively, in base management fees under the investment management agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Advisor earned $5,784,734 and $18,691,632, respectively, in base management fees.  
   Incentive Management Fee Until March 6, 2017    
 The current investment management agreement provides that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to an incentive management fee (the
 Incentive Fee ) as described below under certain circumstances until March 6, 2017. The Incentive Fee is calculated in the same manner as the Incentive Fee in the previous investment management agreement. The determination of the
Incentive Fee, as described in more detail below, will result in the Advisor or its affiliates receiving no Incentive Fee payments if returns to stockholders do not meet an 8.0% annualized rate of return during the applicable fee measurement period,
and will result in the  
      29  

Table of Contents  

Advisor or its affiliates receiving less than the full amount of the Incentive Fee percentage until returns to stockholders exceed an approximate 13.3% annualized rate of return during such
period. Annualized rate of return in this context is computed by reference to net asset value and does not take into account changes in the market price of the common stock.  
 The Advisor will be entitled to receive the Incentive Fee if the performance exceeds a  hurdle rate  during different measurement
periods: trailing four quarters  periods (which apply only to the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income) and annual periods (which apply only to the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains). The  trailing four
quarters  periods  for purposes of determining the income portion of the Incentive Fee payable for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was determined by reference to the four quarter periods ended on September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The term  annual period  means the period beginning on July 1 of each calendar year and ending on June 30 of the next calendar year.  
 The hurdle rate for each measurement period is 2.0% multiplied by net asset values at the beginning of each calendar quarter during the
measurement period, calculated after giving effect to any distributions that occurred during the measurement period. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains. Each portion of the Incentive Fee is
described below.      Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income Until March 6, 2017    
 For each trailing four quarters  period, the Company will pay the Advisor an Incentive Fee based on the amount by which
(A) aggregate distributions and amounts distributable out of taxable net income (excluding any capital gain and loss), during the period less the amount, if any, by which net unrealized capital depreciation exceeds net realized capital gains /
losses during the period, is in excess of (B) the hurdle rate for the period. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for each period is referred to as the excess income amount.  
 It should be noted that net realized capital gains / losses during the period are calculated as the proceeds received upon disposition less the
fair market value as of the beginning of the measurement period. Since this calculation is not cumulative, but rather performed on a trailing four quarters period, fluctuations in fair market values are captured in net unrealized appreciation and
depreciation of prior measurement periods.    The portion of the Incentive Fee based on income for each period will equal 50% of the
period s excess income amount, until the cumulative Incentive Fee payments for the period equal 20% of the period s income amount distributed or distributable to stockholders as described in clause (A) of the preceding paragraph.
Thereafter, the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income for the period will equal 20% of the period s amount distributed or distributable to stockholders.  
 For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Advisor earned zero in Incentive Fees based on income from the Company.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Advisor earned zero and $11,061, respectively, in Incentive Fees based on income from the Company.  
   Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains Until March 6, 2017    
 The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated and paid on an annual basis beginning on July 1 of each annual
period and ending on June 30 of the next calendar year. The portion of Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated in the same manner as such portion of the Incentive Fee in the prior investment management agreement. For each annual
period, the Company pays the Advisor an Incentive Fee on capital gains based on the amount by which (A) net realized capital gains, if any, exceeds gross unrealized capital depreciation, if any, occurring during the period in excess of
(B) the amount, if any, by which the period s hurdle rate exceeds the amount of income used in the determination of the Incentive Fee based on income for the period. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this
paragraph is referred to as the excess gain amount.  
      30  

Table of Contents  

  It should be noted that net realized capital gains during the period are calculated as the
proceeds received upon disposition in excess of the lower of each security s amortized cost or the fair market value as of the beginning of the measurement period. Since this calculation is not cumulative, but rather performed on an annual
period commencing each July 1, any unrealized depreciation on a security, if any, will be captured in the gross unrealized depreciation of a prior period.  
 The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for each period will equal 50% of the period s excess gain amount, until such
payments equal 20% of the period s capital gain amount distributed or distributable to stockholders. Thereafter, the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for the period equals an amount such that the portion of the Incentive Fee
payments to the Advisor based on capital gains for the period equals 20% of the period s capital gain amount distributed or distributable to stockholders. The result of this formula is that, if the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income
for the period exceeds the period s hurdle, then the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains will be capped at 20% of the capital gain amount.  
 In calculating whether the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is payable with respect to any period, we account for assets on
a security-by-security basis. In addition, the Company uses the  period-to-period  method pursuant to which the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for any period is based on realized capital gains for the period reduced by
realized capital losses and gross unrealized capital depreciation for the period. Based on current interpretations of Section 205(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by the SEC and its staff, the calculation of unrealized depreciation
for each portfolio security over a period is based on the fair value of the security at the end of the period compared to the fair value at the beginning of the period. Incentive Fees earned in any of the periods described above are not subject to
modification or repayment based upon performance in a subsequent period.    The Company is required under GAAP to accrue a hypothetical
capital gains Incentive Fee based upon net realized capital gains and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual of this hypothetical capital gains incentive fee assumes all unrealized
capital appreciation and depreciation is realized in order to reflect a hypothetical capital gains Incentive Fee that would be payable at each measurement date. If such amount is positive at the end of the period, then we record a capital gains
incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, less the amount of capital gains related Incentive Fees already accrued in prior periods. If the resulting amount is negative, the accrual for GAAP in a given period may result in the reduction of an
expense. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. However, it should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under the Advisers Act or the investment management
agreement. Amounts actually paid will be consistent with the Advisers Act which specifically excludes consideration of unrealized capital appreciation.  
 The capital gains Incentive Fee due to the Advisor as calculated under the investment management agreement as described above, at
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was zero. In accordance with GAAP, the hypothetical liquidation for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulted in a capital gains incentive fee accrual/(reversal) of zero. The hypothetical
liquidation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulted in a capital gains incentive fee accrual/(reversal) of $(4,224,731) and $(3,200,520), respectively. The total cumulative accrued balance at September 30, 2016 and
2015 was zero.

    Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income After March 6, 2017    
 After March 6, 2017, the investment management agreement provides that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to an incentive
management fee under certain circumstances. The Incentive Fee has two parts. The first portion is based on income other than capital gains and is calculated separately for each calendar quarter and will be paid on a quarterly basis. The Company will
pay the Advisor the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income for each period as follows:      

(i) 
 No Incentive Fee based on income other than capital gains for any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock
at the beginning of such quarter.        

(ii) 
 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for such calendar quarter, that exceeds 1.75% (7.00%
annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter but is less than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized).        

(iii) 
 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for any calendar quarter that exceeds 2.1875% (8.75% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter.
     The payment of any such Incentive Fee based on income otherwise earned by the Advisor will be deferred if, for the most
recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the Annualized Rate of Return is less than 7.0% of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such four quarter period as adjusted
for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during such four full calendar quarter period, with any deferred Incentive Fees to be carried over for payment in subsequent quarterly calculation
periods to the extent such payment can then be made in accordance with the investment management agreement.      Annual Incentive Fee
Based on Capital Gains After March 6, 2017      The second portion of the Incentive Fee is based on capital gains and is
calculated separately for each Annual Period. The Advisor will be entitled to receive an Incentive Fee based on capital gains for each Annual Period in an amount equal to 20% of the amount by which (1) net realized capital gains occurring
during the period, if any, exceeds (2) gross unrealized capital depreciation, if any, occurring during the period. In calculating the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains payable for any period, investments are accounted for on a
security-by-security basis. In addition, the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined using the  period-to-period  method pursuant to which the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for any period
will be based on realized capital gains for the period reduced by realized capital losses for the period and unrealized capital depreciation for the period.  
 For purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee, (i)  Annual Period  means the period beginning on July 1 of each calendar
year, including the calendar year prior to the year in which the investment management agreement became effective, and ending on June 30 of the next calendar year; (ii)  Annualized Rate of Return  is computed by reference to the
sum of (i) the aggregate distributions to common stockholders for the period in question and (ii) the change in net assets attributable to common stock (before taking into account any Incentive Fees otherwise payable during such period);
(iii)  net assets attributable to common stock  means total assets less indebtedness and preferred stock; and (iv)  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  means net investment income (as determined in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles) accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter excluding any accruals for or payments in respect of the Incentive Fee.  
   Advisor Reimbursements    
 The investment management agreement provides that the Company will reimburse the Advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor for
administrative or operating services, office space rental, office  
      32  

Table of Contents  

equipment and utilities allocable to the Advisor under the investment management agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor relating to any non-investment advisory,
administrative or operating services provided by the Advisor to us. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $87,500 and $262,500, respectively, for such investment advisor expenses under the Management
Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $309,730 and $714,343, respectively, for such investment advisor expenses under the Management Agreement.  
 From time to time, the Advisor may pay amounts owed by the Company to third party providers of goods or services. The Company will subsequently
reimburse the Advisor for such amounts paid on its behalf. Reimbursements to the Advisor for such purposes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were zero and $5,921 respectively. Reimbursements to the Advisor for such
purposes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were zero and $158,350 respectively.    No person who is an officer,
director or employee of the Advisor and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for such services. Directors who are not affiliated with the Advisor receive compensation for their services and reimbursement
of expenses incurred to attend meetings.      Administration

    Industry Composition    
 The industry composition of the portfolio at fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as follows:  
   
   The geographic composition of the portfolio at fair value at September 30, 2016 was United States 93.8%,
Bermuda 3.5%, Canada 1.5% and the Cayman Islands 1.2%, and at December 31, 2015 was United States 93.6%, Bermuda 3.7%, Canada 1.7% and the Cayman Islands 1.0%. The geographic composition is determined by several factors including the location
of the corporate headquarters of the portfolio company.      Market and Credit Risk    
 In the normal course of business, the Company invests in securities and enters into transactions where risks exist due to fluctuations in the
market (market risk) or failure of the issuer of a security to meet all its obligations (issuer credit risk). The value of securities held by the Company may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the issuers whose
securities are owned by the Company; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; and currency and interest rate and price fluctuations. Similar to issuer
credit risk, the Company may be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that an entity with which the Company has unsettled or open transactions may fail to or be unable to perform on its commitments. The Company manages counterparty risk
by entering into transactions only with counterparties that they believe have the financial resources to honor their obligations and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties. Financial assets, which potentially expose the
Company to market, issuer and counterparty credit risks, consist principally of investments in portfolio companies. The extent of the Company s exposure to market, issuer and counterparty credit risks with respect to
 
      36  

Table of Contents  

these financial assets is generally approximated by their value recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The Company is also exposed to credit risk related to
maintaining all of its cash at a major financial institution.    The Company has investments in lower rated and comparable quality unrated
senior and junior secured, unsecured and subordinated debt securities and loans, which are subject to a greater degree of credit risk than more highly rated investments. The risk of loss due to default by the issuer is significantly greater for
holders of such securities and loans, particularly in cases where the investment is unsecured or subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.  
   BCIC Senior Loan Partners, LLC    
 On June 23, 2016, the Company and Windward Investments LLC ( Windward ) entered into an agreement to create BCIC Senior Loan
Partners, LLC ( Senior Loan Partners ), a joint venture. Senior Loan Partners is structured as an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company, and is expected to make loans to and other investments in portfolio companies. All
portfolio and other material decisions regarding Senior Loan Partners must be submitted to its board of directors, which is comprised of four members, two of whom were selected by the Company and two of whom were selected by Windward, and must be
approved by at least one member appointed by the Company and one appointed by Windward. In addition, certain matters may be approved by Senior Loan Partners  investment committee, which is comprised of one member appointed by the Company and
one member appointed by Windward.    The Company and Windward have committed to provide an aggregate of $100.0 million of equity to Senior
Loan Partners, with the Company providing $85.0 million and Windward providing $15.0 million.    On June 24, 2016, Senior Loan Partners
as Seller and Collateral Manager, and BCIC Senior Loan Funding, LLC ( Senior Loan Funding ), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, as Borrower entered into a $200.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the  LSA  or
the  Senior Facility ) with Citibank, N.A. ( Citi ) acting as Administrative Agent and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company ( BoNY ) as Collateral Agent. The Senior Facility is scheduled to mature on June 24,
2021. Senior Loan Partners and Senior Loan Funding, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various covenants, including collateral maintenance, reporting requirements, usual and
customary events of default and other customary requirements for similar facilities. As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were drawn on the Senior Facility, and Senior Loan Partners and Senior Loan Funding were not in default with any covenants or
requirements under the Senior Facility.    The Company does not consolidate its non-controlling interests in Senior Loan Partners because the
entity is not considered a substantially wholly owned investment company subsidiary, as provided under ASC 946. Senior Loan Partners is a joint venture for which shared power exists relating to the decisions that most significantly impact the
economic performance of the entity.    As of September 30, 2016, Senior Loan Partners had called and received $26.2 million of combined
equity capital, of which the Company funded $22.3 million and Windward funded $3.9 million. As of September 30, 2016, Senior Loan Partners had received $4.8 million of contributions in advance from Windward, which is recorded as a liability in
Senior Loan Partners  Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, as shown in the selected balance sheet information below. As a result, remaining commitments from the Company and Windward as of September 30, 2016 were $62.7 million and
$6.3 million, respectively. Capital contributions have been used to make investments and to fund certain start-up expenses of Senior Loan Partners.  
 As of September 30, 2016, Senior Loan Partners had total investments at fair value of $24.2 million, comprised of senior secured first
lien loans to two different borrowers and both a senior secured first lien loan and a revolving loan to a third borrower. As of September 30, 2016, none of these loans were on non-accrual status. Proceeds from investment sales, prepayments or exits
for the period ending September 30, 2016 were $17.5 thousand. Additionally, Senior Loan Partners had unfunded commitments to fund a revolver and a delayed  
      37

draw loan to one of its portfolio companies totaling $2.1 million. The weighted average yield of the portfolio at its current cost basis as of September 30, 2016 was 6.76%. Below is a summary of
Senior Loan Partners  portfolio as of September 30, 2016:      

(1) 
 100% of the senior secured loans in BCIC Senior Loan Partners  portfolio bear interest at a floating rate that may be determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other base rate
(commonly the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate), at the borrower s option. In addition, 100% of such senior secured loans have floors of 1.00%. The borrower under a senior secured loan generally has the option to select from interest reset
periods of one, two, three or six months and may alter that selection at the end of any reset period. The stated interest rate represents the weighted average interest rate at September 30, 2016 of all contracts within the specified loan
facility.

  6. Derivatives       Foreign Currency
     The Company may enter into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales
of investments denominated in foreign currencies or to help mitigate the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company s investments denominated in
 
      39  

Table of Contents  

foreign currencies. A forward foreign currency contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date (usually the security transaction settlement date) at a negotiated
forward rate. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are
settled. The Company s forward foreign currency contracts generally have terms of approximately three months. The volume of open contracts at the end of each reporting period is reflective of the typical volume of transactions during each
calendar quarter. Risks may arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company attempts to limit this risk by dealing with only creditworthy counterparties. There were no open forward
foreign currency contracts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.      Warrants and Options    
 The Company holds warrants and options in certain portfolio companies in an effort to achieve additional investment return. In purchasing
warrants and options, the Company bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the value of the underlying equity interest. The aggregate fair value of warrants and options as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 represents 0.1% and
0.4%, respectively, of the Company s net assets.    The Company may enter into other derivative instruments and incur other exposures
with other counterparties in the future. The derivative instruments held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 reflect the volume of derivative activity throughout the periods presented.  
  7. Debt     In accordance with the 1940
Act, with certain limited exceptions, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s asset
coverage was 288%.    On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
(the  Credit Facility ) which has an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $440,000,000, a stated commitment termination date of February 19, 2020, and a stated maturity date of February 19, 2021. The interest rate
applicable to Eurocurrency borrowings thereunder is generally LIBOR plus an applicable margin of either 1.75% or 2.00% based on a pricing grid using the borrowing base as a multiple of the combined debt amount. The interest rate applicable to ABR
borrowings thereunder is generally the prime rate in effect plus an applicable margin of either 0.75% or 1.00% based on a pricing grid using the borrowing base as a multiple of the combined debt amount. The Credit Facility s commitment may
increase in size, under certain circumstances, up to a total of $750,000,000. From the commitment termination date to the stated maturity date, the Company is required to repay outstanding principal amounts under the Credit Facility on a monthly
basis in an amount equal to 1/12 th  of the outstanding amount at the commitment termination date.  
 On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the  Term
Loan ) which has a principal amount of $15,000,000. The Term Loan has a stated maturity date of March 27, 2019. The interest rate applicable to borrowings thereunder is generally LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.25%.  
 On February 19, 2013, the Company closed a private offering of $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.50% unsecured convertible
senior notes due 2018 (the  Convertible Notes ). The initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes fully exercised their overallotment option and purchased an additional $15,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The
closing of the overallotment option took place on March 4, 2013. With the exercise of the overallotment option, a total of $115,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes was sold. Net proceeds to the Company from the
offering, including the exercise of the overallotment option, were approximately $111,300,000. The Convertible Notes were only offered to qualified institutional buyers as defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities
Act ) pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

  The Convertible Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable
semi-annually in arrears. In certain circumstances and during certain periods, the Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the
Company s common stock, at the Company s election, at an initial conversion rate of 86.0585 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$11.62 per share of the Company s common stock, subject to defined anti-dilution adjustments. The Company does not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The Convertible Notes mature on February 15, 2018, unless
repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.    On January 18, 2011, the Company closed a private
placement issuance of $158,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of five-year, senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.50% and a maturity date of January 18, 2016 and $17,000,000 million in aggregate principal amount of seven-year,
senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.60% and a maturity date of January 18, 2018 (collectively, the  Senior Secured Notes ). The $158,000,000 five-year, senior secured notes matured on January 18, 2016 and were
refinanced under the Company s Credit Facility.    The Senior Secured Notes were sold to certain institutional accredited investors
pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is due semi-annually on January 18 and July 18, commencing on July 18, 2011.

ended September 30, 2015 was $350,957,227 and $416,169,914, respectively. The maximum amounts borrowed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $362,659,979 and
$452,659,979, respectively and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $376,411,830 and $478,411,830, respectively.  
 Amortization of $400,747 and $1,239,908 related to debt issuance costs are now presented as interest expense within the consolidated statements

 Under the Credit Facility, Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes, the Company is required to comply with various affirmative and restrictive
covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar debt facilities, including, without limitation, covenants related to: (a) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, (b) limitations on
certain investments, (c) limitations on distributions and certain other restricted payments, (d) certain restrictions on subsidiaries and fundamental changes thereto, (e) maintaining a certain minimum shareholders  equity,
(f) maintaining an asset coverage ratio of not less than 2.0:1.0, (g) limitations on certain transactions with affiliates, (h) limitations on pledging certain unencumbered assets, and (i) limitations on the creation or existence
of agreements that prohibit liens on certain properties of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Credit Facility, Term Loan
and Senior Secured Notes. Further, amounts available to borrow under the Credit Facility, Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are also subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies
different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company s portfolio that are pledged as collateral.    The Credit Facility,
Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.    The
Convertible Notes contain certain covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to reserve shares of common stock for the purpose of satisfying all obligations to issue the underlying securities upon conversion of the securities and to
furnish to holders of the securities upon request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants required under the Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Term Loan
and Senior Secured Notes.     8. Capital stock   
 In 2008, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase up to 2.5 percent of
its outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. In 2009, the Board of Directors approved an extension and increase to the plan which authorized the Company to repurchase up to an
additional 2.5 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock. During April 2015, the Board of Directors approved an extension and increase to the plan which authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional 2.5 percent of its outstanding
shares of common stock, or an additional 1,869,399 shares.    During July 2015, the Board of Directors approved an extension to the plan and
an increase to the remaining amount of shares authorized to be repurchased to a total of 4,000,000 shares. During April 2016, the  
      42  

Table of Contents  

repurchase plan was extended until the earlier of June 30, 2017 or such time that all of the authorized shares have been repurchased. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company purchased a total of 1,904,064 shares of its common stock on the open market for $16,093,205, including brokerage commissions. No such shares were purchased for the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased a total of 691,423 and 691,423 shares, respectively, of its common stock on the open market for $6,113,290 and $6,113,290, respectively, including brokerage commissions. Since inception of the
repurchase plan through September 30, 2016, the Company has purchased 4,551,965 shares of its common stock on the open market for $36,302,821, including brokerage commissions. At September 30, 2016, the total number of remaining shares
authorized for repurchase was 1,206,650. The Company currently holds the shares it repurchased in treasury.     9. Guarantees, commitments and
contingencies     In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into guarantees on behalf of portfolio companies. Under these
arrangements, the Company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. There were no such guarantees outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. In addition, from time to time, the Company may provide for a commitment to a portfolio company for investment in an existing or new security. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was obligated to existing
portfolio companies for unfunded commitments of $67.0 million and $13.1 million, respectively. Of the $67.0 million total unfunded commitments at September 30, 2016, $62.7 million was on our aggregate $85.0 million equity commitment to BCIC Senior
Loan Partners, LLC, a newly formed joint venture (See Note 5). We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.  
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual agreements that provide general indemnifications against losses, costs,
claims and liabilities arising from the performance of individual obligations under such agreements. The Company has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to such agreements. The Company s individual maximum exposure under these arrangements
is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on management s experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.  
 From time to time, we and the Advisor may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including
the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While we cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.    As previously disclosed, we have been named as a defendant, together with 52nd Street Capital Advisors LLC
( 52nd Street ), our former investment adviser, and certain other defendants, in two wrongful death and personal injury actions that were filed by the families of the three decedents and certain injured persons (the  Plaintiffs )
on June 22, 2012 and August 23, 2012, in the Circuit Court of Hancock County in West Virginia (the  Litigation ). The cases, which have been consolidated, involve three deaths and personal injuries to other employees that
occurred on December 9, 2010 at the facilities of one of our portfolio companies.    We and
52 nd  Street have reached an agreement in principle with the Plaintiffs to settle the actions for $17,500,000 (the  Settlement Payment ) and certain of the Plaintiffs have filed a
petition for Court approval of the settlement. We have determined that we are reasonably likely to enter into a definitive settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs. Although a definitive settlement agreement remains subject to final documentation
and Court approval, we accrued for the Settlement Payment for the quarter-ending September 30, 2016 and anticipate we will pay the Settlement Payment on behalf of ourselves and 52nd Street in the fourth quarter, using available cash and amounts
available under its credit facility.    Previously, we and 52 nd  Street filed motions to
dismiss in both cases. On June 18, 2015, the court entered an order denying those motions, and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia subsequently denied our  
      43

writ seeking review of that ruling. On August 19, 2015, the Court entered a separate order releasing certain insurance proceeds to the estates of the deceased workers. On October 16, 2015, the
trial court granted Defendant AL Solutions, Inc. s motion for partial summary judgment seeking to void certain contracts to the extent we, 52 nd  Street, and another defendant sought
contractual indemnification with respect to the subject lawsuits. We have appealed that ruling to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which is pending. The original September 8, 2016 trial date has been continued and will be reset, if
necessary, after the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals rules on the pending appeal.     10. Fair value of financial instruments   
   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure    
 ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC
820-10 defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. ASC
820-10 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability,
including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances.    Level 1   Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.    Level 2   Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in
markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.    Level 3
  Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.  
 Transfers between levels, if any, represent the value as of the beginning of the period of any investment where a change in the pricing level
occurred from the beginning to the end of the period.    The Company s valuation policy and fair value disclosures are consistent with
ASC 820-10. The Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading, in determining fair value and categorizes each investment within the fair value hierarchy pursuant to ASC 820-10.  
 Under the 1940 Act, the Company is required to separately identify non-controlled investments where it owns 5% or more of a portfolio
company s outstanding voting securities as investments in  affiliated  companies. In addition, under the 1940 Act, the Company is required to separately identify investments where it owns more than 25% of a portfolio company s
outstanding voting securities as investments in  controlled  companies. Detailed information with respect to the Company s non-controlled non-affiliated, non-controlled affiliated and controlled investments is contained in the
accompanying consolidated schedules of investments and consolidated financial statements. The information in the tables below is presented on an aggregate portfolio basis, without segregating the non-controlled non-affiliated, non-controlled
affiliated and controlled investment categories.    The carrying values of the Company s financial instruments approximate fair value.

The valuation techniques used at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in determining the fair
values of the Company s investments for which significant unobservable inputs were used were the market approach, income approach or both using third party valuation firms or broker quotes for identical or similar assets. The total fair market
value using the market or income approach or both using third party valuation firms was $946,594,327 and $1,116,535,669 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The remaining balance was determined using broker quotes
for identical or similar assets.    The following is a reconciliation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of investments for

  Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 on investments still held by the Company at the respective period ends, for which Level 3 inputs were used in determining fair value was ($95,879,084) and $5,690,895, respectively.  
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach of fair value measurement of the Company s investments are the market
multiples of earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of the comparable guideline public companies. The independent valuation firms select a population of public companies for each investment with similar
operations and attributes of the subject company. Using these guideline public companies  data, a range of multiples of enterprise value to EBITDA is calculated. The independent valuation firms select percentages from the range of multiples for
purposes of determining the subject company s estimated enterprise value based on said multiple and generally the latest twelve months EBITDA of the subject company (or other meaningful measure). Significant increases or decreases in the
multiple will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, resulting in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment.  
 The significant unobservable input used in the income approach of fair value measurement of the Company s investments is the discount rate
or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate or market
yield would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields are the following factors: risk of default, rating of the investment and comparable company
investments, and call provisions.    The ranges of significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s
Level 3 investments as of September 30, 2016 were as follows:

    Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
  The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in
this report.     This report, and other statements that we may make, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to future
financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as  trend,   opportunity,   pipeline,   believe, 
 comfortable,   expect,   anticipate,   current,   intention,   estimate,   position,   assume,   potential,   outlook,   continue, 
 remain,   maintain,   sustain,   seek,   achieve  and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as  will,   would,   should,   could, 
 may  or similar expressions.    Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which
change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we assume no duty to and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.    In addition to factors previously
identified elsewhere in the reports BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
forward-looking statements or historical performance:      

our future operating results;        

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;        

the impact of investments that we expect to make;        

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;        

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;        

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;        

our expected financings and investments;        

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital, including our ability to obtain continued financing on favorable terms;        

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies;        

the impact of increased competition;        

the ability of the Advisor to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments;        

potential conflicts of interest in the allocation of opportunities between us and other investment funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates;    

the ability of the Advisor to attract and retain highly talented professionals;        

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and

   Overview   
 We were incorporated in Delaware on April 13, 2005 and commenced operations with private funding on July 25, 2005, and completed our
initial public offering on July 2, 2007. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of senior and junior
secured and unsecured debt securities and loans, each of which may include an equity component, and by making direct preferred, common and other equity investments in such companies.  
 We are externally managed and have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain
regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in  qualifying assets,  including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government
securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.    Certain items previously reported may have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.      Investments    
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt
and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.  
 As a BDC, we generally do not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the
acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  Under the relevant SEC rules, the term  eligible
portfolio company  includes most private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market
capitalization of less than $250 million. These rules also permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the
definition.      Revenues    
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold, dividends on our equity interests and capital gains on the sale of
warrants and other debt or equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to ten years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity, and
typically bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our debt instruments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or
dividends or pay interest or dividends in-kind. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of
prepayment fees, commitment, origination, capital structuring fees and fees for providing significant managerial assistance.  
   Expenses      Our
primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and, depending on our operating results, an incentive management fee, interest and credit facility fees, expenses reimbursable under the management agreement, administration
fees and the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement. The base management fee and incentive management fee compensate the Advisor for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. Our
management agreement with the Advisor provides that we will reimburse the Advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor for  
      52  

Table of Contents  

office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the Advisor under the management agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor relating to any
non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Advisor to us. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.  
  Critical accounting policies     Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could
cause actual results to differ.    Management considers the critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated
financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of
significant accounting policies and of recently issued accounting pronouncements.     Financial and operating highlights

 Net investment loss, as adjusted 1 : $2.1 million  
 Net decrease in net assets from operations, as adjusted 1 : $39.1 million  
  As Adjusted  1 : Amounts are adjusted to remove the incentive management fee expense
based on gains, as required by GAAP, and to include only the incremental incentive management fee expense based on income. The incremental incentive management fee is calculated based on the current quarter s incremental earnings, and without
any reduction for incentive management fees paid during the prior calendar quarters. Amounts reflect the Company s ongoing operating results and reflect the Company s financial performance over time.  
  Portfolio and investment activity     We
invested $43.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The new investments consisted of senior secured loans secured by first liens ($1.0 million, or 2.3%), senior secured loans secured by
 
      53  

Table of Contents  

second liens ($7.4 million, or 16.9%) and unsecured or subordinated debt securities and equity securities ($35.4 million, or 80.8%). Additionally, we received proceeds from sales/repayments and
other exits of approximately $73.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.    Concentration of our assets in an
issuer, industry or sector may present certain risks. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers, our net asset value may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as
a result of changes in the financial condition or the market s assessment of the issuer. At September 30, 2016, our portfolio of $946.6 million (at fair value) consisted of 38 portfolio companies and was invested 58% in senior secured
loans, 16% in unsecured or subordinated debt securities, 15% in equity investments, and 11% in senior secured notes. Our average investment by portfolio company at amortized cost, excluding investments below $5.0 million, was approximately $32.6
million at September 30, 2016. Our largest portfolio company investment by value was approximately $89.5 million and our five largest portfolio company investments by value comprised approximately 28% of our portfolio at September 30,
2016. At December 31, 2015, our portfolio of $1,117.0 million (at fair value) consisted of 45 portfolio companies and was invested 68% in senior secured loans, 15% in unsecured or subordinated debt securities, 11% in equity investments and 6%
in senior secured notes. Our average investment by portfolio company at amortized cost, excluding investments below $5.0 million, was approximately $32.5 million at December 31, 2015. Our largest portfolio company investment by value was
approximately $64.7 million and our five largest portfolio company investments by value comprised approximately 24% of our portfolio at December 31, 2015.  
 In addition, we may, from time to time, invest a substantial portion of our assets in the securities of issuers in any single industry or
sector of the economy or in only a few issuers. A downturn in an industry or sector in which we are concentrated could have a larger impact on us than on a company that does not concentrate in that particular industry or sector. Our Advisor monitors
industry and sector uncertainties on an ongoing basis, including substantial regulatory challenges in the healthcare sector, volatility and extensive government regulation in the financial services sector, cyclical risks associated with the overall
economy that may affect the consumer products sector, risks related to the costs of raw materials and energy affecting the chemicals sector, cyclicality within the energy sector as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices and demand for, and
production of commodities, among various other industry and sector uncertainties due to certain exposures. At September 30, 2016, our top three industry concentrations at fair value consisted of Finance (18.8%), Services: Business (12.4%) and
Chemicals, Plastics,   Rubber (11.4%). At December 31, 2015, our top three industry concentrations at fair value consisted of Healthcare   Pharmaceuticals (12.8%), Consumer Goods: Durable (12.3%) and Chemicals,
Plastics,   Rubber (10.9%) (See Note 5).    The weighted average yield of the debt and income producing equity securities in our
portfolio at fair value was 11.4% at September 30, 2016 and 11.6% at December 31, 2015. The weighted average yields on our senior secured loans and other debt securities at fair value were 10.7% and 12.6%, respectively, at
September 30, 2016, versus 11.4% and 13.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The weighted average yield of the debt and income producing equity securities in our portfolio at their current cost basis was 10.0% at September 30, 2016
and 11.0% at December 31, 2015. The weighted average yields on our senior secured loans and other debt securities at their current cost basis were 9.5% and 11.1%, respectively, at September 30, 2016, versus 11.0% and 11.2%, respectively,
at December 31, 2015. Yields exclude common equity investments, preferred equity investments with no stated dividend rate, short-term investments, and cash and cash equivalents.

  The Advisor employs a grading system for our entire portfolio. The Advisor grades all loans on a
scale of 1 to 4. This system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower s business, the collateral coverage of the loans and other factors considered relevant. Generally, the Advisor assigns only one loan grade to each portfolio
company for all loan investments in that portfolio company; however, the Advisor will assign multiple ratings when appropriate for different investments in one portfolio company. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each
investment rating:     Grade 1:  Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is substantially within the Advisor s
expectations and whose risk factors are neutral to favorable to those at the time of the original investment.     Grade 2:  Investments
in portfolio companies whose performance is below the Advisor s expectations and that require closer monitoring; however, no loss of investment return (interest and/or dividends) or principal is expected.  
  Grade 3:  Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is below the Advisor s expectations and for which risk has increased
materially since origination. Some loss of investment return is expected, but no loss of principal is expected. Companies graded 3 generally will be out of compliance with debt covenants and will be unlikely to make debt repayments on their original
schedule.     Grade 4:  Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor s expectations where
business trends have deteriorated and risk factors have increased substantially since the original investment. Investments graded 4 are those for which some loss of principal is expected.  
 The Advisor monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with
our valuation process, the Advisor and Board of Directors review these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. Our average investment rating was 1.40 at September 30, 2016 and 1.29 at December 31, 2015. The following is a distribution of
the investment ratings of our portfolio companies at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
    Results of operations   
  Results comparisons for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
   Investment income    
 Investment income totaled $26,153,452 and $33,940,028, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, of which
$16,192,117 and $21,872,366 were attributable to interest and fees on senior secured loans, $7,979,526 and $10,428,908 to interest and fees earned on other debt securities, $1,976,027 and $1,636,465 to dividends and fees from equity securities and
$5,782 and $2,289 to interest earned on cash equivalents, respectively. The 23% decline in investment income over the respective periods is primarily attributable to 11.1% of the debt portfolio, at amortized cost, on non-accrual status as of the end
of the current period. In addition, fee income decreased $1,355,753 to $539,088 for three months ended September 30, 2016.

  Interest income is comprised of approximately 8% of PIK interest for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.      Expenses    
 Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $28,284,443 and $10,144,878, respectively, which consisted of
$17,500,000 and zero of a one-time legal settlement expense related to a former portfolio company (See Note 9), $5,188,115 and $5,784,734 in base management fees, $3,831,364 and $5,806,749 in interest and credit facility fees, $575,000 and $585,752
in professional fees, $382,977 and $587,623 in investment advisor and administrative services expenses, $160,250 and $187,000 in director fees, zero and $(4,224,731) of incentive management fees based on gains, and $646,737 and $1,417,751 in other
expenses, respectively. The decrease in the current period base management fees is due to an approximate 10% decline in the total assets on which management fees are calculated (in arrears). Interest and credit facility fees declined $1,975,385 over
the respective periods due to the refinancing of the Senior Secured Notes under the Credit Facility during January 2016, as well as the refinancing of the Credit Facility during February 2016 which reduced pricing up to 50 basis points per annum.
Investment advisor and administrative services expenses declined more than 34% period-over-period due to streamlining the finance group to capture value created from being fully integrated on to the BlackRock platform during the third quarter of
2015, which is fully reflected in the current period amount. The other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased more than 54% over the comparable 2015 period due largely to a one-time blocker tax expense incurred during
the 2015 period.      Net investment income (loss)    
 Net investment income (loss) was $(2,130,991) and $23,795,150 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
decrease over the comparable periods was due to a $7,786,576 decline in investment income due to non-accruals during the current period, as well as a 179% increase in aggregate expenses during the current period due primarily to a one-time legal
settlement expense incurred of $17,500,000 (See Note 9). The legal settlement expense was slightly offset by the decrease in interest and credit facility charges, base management fees, and investment advisor and administrative services expenses for
the current period.      Net realized gain or loss    
 Net realized gain or loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $26,591,127. The net loss was primarily driven by a
$25,323,534 net loss realized on the restructuring of our debt and equity investments in ETX Energy, LLC, et al., (formerly New Gulf Resources, LLC  New Gulf ) during the quarter. Nearly the entire realized loss was reflected in unrealized
depreciation in prior periods. Net realized gain or loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was a gain of $2,585,808, comprised of additional escrow proceeds received from the previous exit of our Dial Global, Inc. preferred equity
interest in 2013.      Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation    
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and
foreign currency translation was an increase in net unrealized depreciation of $10,351,063 and $4,653,130, respectively. The current period depreciation was primarily comprised of $33,105,227 of overall net declines due to portfolio valuations
during the quarter, partially offset by $22,754,164 of total unrealized appreciation primarily resulting from the reversal of previously recognized depreciation upon dispositions, namely the New Gulf restructuring. The increase in net unrealized
depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily comprised of $5,038,787 of overall net declines due to portfolio valuations during the quarter.

    Net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations    
 The net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was a
decrease of $39,073,181 and an increase of $21,727,828, respectively. As compared to the prior period, the significant decrease is reflective of an overall decrease in net investment income of $25,926,141 period-over-period, taken in conjunction
with a net realized and unrealized loss of $36,942,190 for the current period, versus $2,067,322 of net realized and unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Results comparisons for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
   Investment income    
 Investment income totaled $89,419,409 and $97,627,101, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, of which
$59,083,476 and $60,910,824 were attributable to interest and fees on senior secured loans, $25,249,145 and $32,603,784 to interest and fees earned on other debt securities, $5,067,544 and $4,106,044 to dividends and fees from equity securities, and
$19,244 and $6,449 to interest earned on cash equivalents, respectively. The decrease in investment income over the respective periods is primarily attributable to a $1,438,747 increase in fees earned to a total of $5,472,804 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, more than offset by a more than 10% decrease in interest and dividend income as a result of 15.3%, 12.7% and 11.1% of the debt portfolio, at amortized cost, on non-accrual as of each of the respective 2016 quarter
ends.    Interest income is comprised of approximately 7% of PIK interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Expenses    
 Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $52,465,207 and $40,970,467, respectively, which consisted of
$17,500,000 and zero of a one-time legal settlement expense related to a former portfolio company (See Note 9), $16,600,294 and $18,691,632 in base management fees, $12,641,384 and $18,385,547 in interest and credit facility fees, $1,679,000 and
$1,725,404 in professional fees, $1,313,917 and $2,108,987 in investment advisor and administrative services expenses, $521,750 and $523,500 in director fees, zero and $(3,189,459) in incentive management fees based on income and gains, and
$2,208,862 and $2,724,856 in other expenses, respectively. The decrease in the current period base management fees is due to a decline in the total assets on which management fees are calculated (in arrears). Interest and credit facility fees
declined $5,744,163 over the respective periods due to the refinancing of the Senior Secured Notes under the Credit Facility during January 2016, as well as the refinancing of the Credit Facility during February 2016 which reduced pricing up to 50
basis points per annum. Investment advisor and administrative services expenses declined more than 37% period-over-period due to streamlining the finance group to capture value created from being fully integrated on to the BlackRock platform during
the third quarter of 2015, which is fully reflected in the current period amount. The other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 19% over the comparable 2015 period due largely to a one-time blocker tax
expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Net investment income    
 Net investment income was $36,954,202 and $56,656,634 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
approximate 35% decrease over the comparable periods was a reflection of investments on non-accrual status during the 2016 period, as well as a 28% increase in total expenses during the current period due primarily to a one-time legal settlement
expense incurred of $17,500,000 (See Note 9). The legal settlement expense was slightly offset by the decrease in interest and credit facility charges, base management fees, and investment advisor and administrative services expenses.

    Net realized gain or loss    
 Net realized gain or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $57,530,688. Of this total, $55,698,534 was driven
by losses realized on the restructuring of our debt and equity investments in ETX Energy, LLC, et al., (formerly New Gulf Resources), as well as the restructuring of our debt investments in Hunter Defense Technologies, Inc. ( Hunter ).
Nearly the entire realized loss was reflected in unrealized depreciation in prior periods. Net realized gain or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was a gain of $129,244,763. Net realized gains were primarily generated from the
sales of our equity investments in M M Tradition Holdings Corp., Marquette Transportation Company Holdings LLC, Penton Business Media Holdings, LLC, Oportun Financial Corporation (formerly Progress Financial Corporation), and USI Senior
Holdings, Inc. The realized gains were partially offset by a realized loss on the restructurings of Red Apple Stores Inc. and WBS Group LLC. Nearly the entire realized gain was reflected in unrealized appreciation in prior periods.  
   Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and
foreign currency translation was an increase in net unrealized depreciation of $66,225,551 and a decrease in net unrealized appreciation of $126,779,949, respectively. The current period depreciation was comprised of $114,846,848 of overall net
declines due to portfolio valuations during the nine month period, partially offset by $48,621,297 of total unrealized appreciation primarily resulting from the reversal of previously recognized depreciation upon dispositions, namely the New Gulf
and Hunter restructurings. The decrease in net unrealized appreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was attributable to reversals due to the recognition of realized gains associated with the sale of our equity positions in
M M Tradition Holdings Corp., Marquette Transportation Company Holdings LLC, Penton Business Media Holdings, LLC, Oportun Financial Corporation (formerly Progress Financial Corporation), and USI Senior Holdings, Inc. during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.      Net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations    
 The net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was a decrease
of $86,802,037 and an increase of $59,121,448, respectively. As compared to the prior period, the significant decrease is reflective of an overall decrease in net investment income of approximately 35% period-over-period, taken in conjunction with a
net realized and unrealized loss of $123,756,239 for the current period, versus $2,464,814 of net realized and unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Supplemental Non-GAAP information    
 We report our financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be enhanced if
investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and
investors, of our financial performance over time. Management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  
 We record our liability for Incentive Fees based on income as we become legally obligated to pay them, based on a hypothetical liquidation at
the end of each reporting period. Our obligation to pay Incentive Fees with respect to any fiscal quarter is based on a formula that reflects our results over a trailing four-fiscal quarter period ending with the current fiscal quarter. We are
legally obligated to pay the amount resulting from the formula less any cash payments of Incentive Fees during the prior three quarters. The formula s requirement to reduce the Incentive Fees by amounts paid with respect to Incentive Fees in
the prior three quarters has caused our Incentive Fees expense to become generally concentrated in the fourth quarter of each year. Management believes that  
      58  

Table of Contents  

reflecting Incentive Fees throughout the year, as the related investment income is earned on a quarterly basis, is an effective measure of our profitability and financial performance that
facilitates comparison of current results with historical results and with those of our peers. Our  as adjusted  results reflect Incentive Fees based on the formula we utilize for each trailing four-fiscal quarter period, with the formula
applied to the current quarter s incremental earnings and without any reduction for Incentive Fees paid during the prior three quarters. The resulting amount represents an upper limit of each quarter s incremental Incentive Fees that we
may become legally obligated to pay at the end of the year. Prior year amounts are estimated in the same manner. These estimates represent upper limits because, in any calendar year, subsequent quarters  investment underperformance could reduce
the Incentive Fees payable with respect to prior quarters  operating results. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ and such
differences could be material. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for a more detailed description of the Company s incentive management fee.  
 Computations for all periods are derived from our consolidated financial statements as follows:  
   
    Pre-Incentive Fee   1   :  Amounts are adjusted to remove
all incentive management fees. Such fees are calculated but not necessarily due and payable at this time.     As Adjusted   2  : Amounts are adjusted to remove the incentive management fee expense based on gains, as required by GAAP, and to include only the incremental incentive management fee expense based on income. The
incremental incentive management fee is calculated based on the current quarter s incremental earnings, and without any reduction for incentive management fees paid during the prior calendar quarters. Amounts reflect the Company s ongoing
operating results and reflect the Company s financial performance over time.     Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated operating cash flows primarily from investment dispositions, interest and
fees received on senior secured loans and other debt securities.  
      59  

Table of Contents  

  Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $95,058,587. Our primary sources of cash from operating activities during the period consisted of net proceeds from sales and repayments of $267,906,627, net of purchases of $217,589,147, which includes PIK of $9,067,704, for a net source of
$50,317,480.    Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $100,555,469. Our uses of cash
for financing activities consisted of cash distributions paid of $43,066,163, purchases of treasury stock of $16,093,205, and $41,396,101 in debt repayments, net of borrowings under the Credit Facility.  
   Contractual obligations    
 A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016 is as
follows:      

Off-balance sheet arrangements    
 In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into guarantees on behalf of portfolio companies. Under these arrangements, the
Company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. There were no such guarantees outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In
addition, from time to time, the Company may provide for a commitment to a portfolio company for investment in an existing or new security. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was obligated to existing portfolio
companies for unfunded commitments of $67.0 million and $13.1 million, respectively. Of the $67.0 million total unfunded commitments at September 30, 2016, $62.7 million was on our aggregate $85.0 million equity commitment made during the quarter to
BCIC Senior Loan Partners, LLC, a newly formed joint venture. (See Note 5) We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.  
      60

   Distributions   
 Our quarterly distributions, if any, are determined by our Board of Directors. Distributions are declared considering our estimate of annual
taxable income available for distribution to stockholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at all or
distributions at a particular level. The following table lists the quarterly distributions per share from our common stock since September 2014:      
   Tax characteristics of all distributions are reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.  
 We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute
annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. Under the Regulated
Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, capital losses incurred by the Company after December 31, 2010 will not be subject to expiration. In addition, such losses must be utilized prior to the losses incurred in the years preceding
enactment. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:      

98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year;        

98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31st; and        

any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years.    
 We maintain an  opt out  dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, except as discussed below, if we
declare a distribution, stockholders  cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically  opt out  of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash
distributions. With respect to our distributions paid to stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, distributions reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan totaled $3,003,346 and $2,749,683, respectively.
   Under the terms of an amendment to our dividend reinvestment plan adopted on March 4, 2009, distributions may be paid in newly issued
or treasury shares of our common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market price on the payment date. This feature of the plan means that, under certain circumstances, we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per
share, which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a  
      61  

Table of Contents  

specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as
a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future debt arrangements.    If we do not distribute a certain percentage
of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain
amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since
we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject
to income or excise taxes. In order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we may have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a sufficient portion
of such dividend is paid in cash and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would generally be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  
  Recent developments     On November 1,
2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.21 per share, payable on January 2, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 19, 2016.  
 Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the 1940 Act that from time to time the Company may purchase shares of its
common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk     We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, 67% of our
debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. Of those
floating rate debt investments, 100% contained an interest rate floor. Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor. Interest rate
sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Since we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at
which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. The Company s Credit Facility and Term Loans bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors, while our Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Notes bear interest at fixed rates. As a
result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.  
      62  

Table of Contents  

  The following table shows the approximate annual impact on net investment income of base rate
changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) to our debt portfolio and outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2016, assuming no changes to our investment and borrowing structure:  

(1)  
   Excludes the impact of incentive management fees based on income      While hedging
activities may help to insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they also may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not engage in any interest rate hedging activity.  
    Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed
by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.    There have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 From time to time, we and the Advisor may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including
the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While we cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.    As previously disclosed, we have been named as a defendant, together with 52nd Street Capital Advisors LLC
( 52nd Street ), our former investment adviser, and certain other defendants, in two wrongful death and personal injury actions that were filed by the families of the three decedents and certain injured persons (the  Plaintiffs )
on June 22, 2012 and August 23, 2012, in the Circuit Court of Hancock County in West Virginia (the  Litigation ). The cases, which have been consolidated, involve three deaths and personal injuries to other employees that
occurred on December 9, 2010 at the facilities of one of our portfolio companies.    We and
52 nd  Street have reached an agreement in principle with the Plaintiffs to settle the actions for $17,500,000 (the  Settlement Payment ) and certain of the Plaintiffs have filed a
petition for Court approval of the settlement. We have determined that we are reasonably likely to enter into a definitive settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs. Although a definitive settlement agreement remains subject to final documentation
and Court approval, we accrued for the Settlement Payment for the quarter-ending September 30, 2016 and anticipate we will pay the Settlement Payment on behalf of ourselves and 52nd Street in the fourth quarter, using available cash and amounts
available under its credit facility.    Previously, we and 52 nd  Street filed motions to
dismiss in both cases. On June 18, 2015, the court entered an order denying those motions, and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia subsequently denied our writ seeking review of that ruling. On August 19, 2015, the Court entered a separate
order releasing certain insurance proceeds to the estates of the deceased workers. On October 16, 2015, the trial court granted Defendant AL Solutions, Inc. s motion for partial summary judgment seeking to void certain contracts to the extent
we, 52 nd  Street, and another defendant sought contractual indemnification with respect to the subject lawsuits. We have appealed that ruling to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which is
pending. The original September 8, 2016 trial date has been continued and will be reset, if necessary, after the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals rules on the pending appeal.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K/A filing.  
    Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   
  Sales of unregistered securities     None.
