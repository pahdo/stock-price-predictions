NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

1.      Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

In these notes, the terms  Corning,   Company,   we,   us,  or  our  mean Corning Incorporated and its subsidiary companies. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted or condensed.  These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Corning s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Form 10-K ). 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders  equity. 

New Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 606.  The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU originally was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  This ASU shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  We can elect to adopt the provisions of ASU 2014-09 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date.  We are currently assessing the adoption date and potential impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes all existing guidance on accounting for leases in ASC Topic 840.  ASU 2016-02 is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2016-02 is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients.  We are currently assessing the adoption date and the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods.  If an entity early adopts in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period and the entity must adopt all of the amendments from ASU 2016-09 in the same period.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on our financial statements and related disclosures.  Corning does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 refines how companies classify certain aspects of the cash flow statement in regards to debt prepayment, settlement of debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from insurance claims and life insurance policies, distribution from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently assessing the adoption date and the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which reduces the complexity in the accounting standards by allowing the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Historically, recognition of the income tax consequence was not recognized until the asset was sold to an outside party.  This amendment should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods.  Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance.  We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

2.      Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges 

2016 Activity 

In the first three quarters of 2016, we recorded charges of $78 million, pre-tax, for employee related costs, asset disposals, and exit costs associated with some minor restructuring activities in all of the segments, with total cash expenditures estimated to be $15 million.

3.       Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  

Asbestos Claims 

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation ( PCC ).  PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000 and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the  Plan ) became effective in April 2016.  At December 31, 2015, the Company s liability under the Plan was estimated to be $528 million.  At September 30, 2016, this estimated liability was $290 million, due to the Company s contribution, in the second quarter of 2016, of its equity interests in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. in the total amount of $238 million, as required by the Plan.  Corning recognized a gain of $56 million in the second quarter of 2016 in the selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income for the difference between the fair value of the asbestos litigation liability and carrying value of the investment.  The remaining $290 million liability is for the fixed series of payments required by the Plan.  At September 30, 2016, the total amount of the payments due in years 2018 through 2022 is $220 million and is classified as a non-current liability.  The remaining $70 million payment due in the second quarter of 2017 is classified as a current liability as it is expected to be made within the next twelve months.  Additionally, Corning is a defendant in other cases alleging injuries from asbestos unrelated to PCC (the  non-PCC asbestos claims ) which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the Plan.  The stay was lifted on August 25, 2016.  Corning previously established a $150 million reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims.  The estimated reserve represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years.  The amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available; however, we cannot estimate any lesser or greater liabilities at this time. 

A summary of changes of the estimated asbestos litigation liability is as follows (in millions): 

Non-PCC Asbestos Claims Insurance Litigation 

Several of Corning s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above.  Corning has resolved these issues with a majority of its relevant insurers, and is vigorously contesting these cases with the remaining relevant insurers.  Management is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation with these remaining insurers.

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, any third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  When provided, these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, contingent guarantees totaled a notional value of $201 million and $184 million, respectively.  We believe a significant majority of these contingent guarantees will expire without being funded.  We also were contingently liable for purchase obligations of $255 million and $220 million, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Product warranty liability accruals were considered insignificant at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits, including environmental, product-related suits, and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.  Other than certain asbestos related claims, there are no other material loss contingencies related to litigation. 

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency ( the Agency ) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Corning had accrued approximately $45 million (undiscounted) and $37 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. 

The ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements.  At September 30, 2016, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies was not significant.  While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since we have generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support their growth programs. 

4.      Debt 

Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $4.3 billion at September 30, 2016 and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to recorded book values of $3.9 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market yields for its existing debt traded in the secondary market. 

On July 20, 2016, Corning s Board of Directors approved a $1 billion increase to our commercial paper program, raising it to $2 billion.  If needed, this program is supported by our $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2019.  Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2016.

11 

Debt Issuances 

2015  

In the second quarter of 2015, we issued $375 million of 1.50% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 8, 2018 and $375 million of 2.90% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 15, 2022.  We can redeem these debentures at any time, subject to certain stipulations. 

5.      Income Taxes 

Our benefit (provision) for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits: 

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits: 

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income; 

The impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax; and 

The tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to Corning s tax on Dow Corning s undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits: 

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of high-taxed foreign earnings in U.S. income; and 

The impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax. 

Corning continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation.  Our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  Significant one time or unusual items that may impact our ability or intent to keep our foreign earnings and cash indefinitely reinvested include significant U.S. acquisitions, stock repurchases, shareholder dividends, changes in tax laws, derivative contract settlements or the development of tax planning ideas that allow us to repatriate earnings at minimal or no tax cost, and/or a change in our circumstances or economic conditions that negatively impact our ability to borrow or otherwise fund U.S. needs from existing U.S. sources.  While it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our total unremitted foreign earnings, such cost could be material to the results of operations of Corning in a particular period.

12 

While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position. 

6.      Earnings per Common Share 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (in millions, except per share amounts): 

(1) 

In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Series A convertible preferred stock was anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 

7.      Available-for-Sale Investments 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held $0 million and $100 million of short-term investments (U.S. government and agency securities), respectively.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held long-term investments of $30 million and $33 million in asset-backed securities, respectively.  The Company s investments in available-for-sale securities are held at fair value with amortized cost of $33 million and $37 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

We have no plans to sell, nor do we believe it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell, the long-term investment asset-backed securities (which are collateralized by mortgages) before recovery of their amortized cost basis.  It is possible that a significant degradation in the delinquency or foreclosure rates in the underlying assets could cause further temporary or other-than-temporary impairments in the future. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments totaled approximately $121 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.

8.      Inventories, Net of Inventory Reserves 

Inventories, net of inventory reserves comprise the following (in millions): 

9.      Investments 

On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation ( Dow Corning ) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in December 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group ( HSG ) and approximately $4.8 billion in cash. 

Prior to realignment, HSG, a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning now has a direct equity investment in HSG.  Because our ownership percentage in HSG did not change as a result of the realignment, the investment in HSG is recorded at its carrying value, which had a negative carrying value of $383 million at the transaction date.  The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.  Excluding this charge, the entity is profitable and is expected to recover its equity in the near term. 

Corning s financial statements as of September 30, 2016 include the positive impact of the release of a deferred tax liability of $105 million related to Corning s tax on Dow Corning s earnings that were not distributed as of the date of the transaction and a non-taxable gain of $2,676 million on the realignment.  Details of the gain are illustrated below (in millions): 

(1)   

Primarily consists of the release of accumulated other comprehensive income items related to unamortized actuarial losses related to Dow Corning s pension plan and foreign currency translation gains in the amounts of $260 million and $45 million, respectively.

Investments comprise the following (in millions): 

(1)   

Amounts reflect Corning s direct ownership interests in the respective affiliated companies at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Corning does not control any of such entities. 

(2)   

HSG indirectly holds an 80.5% interest in a HSG operating partnership. 

(3)   

The negative carrying value of the investment in HSG is recorded in Other Liabilities. 

10.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows (in millions): 

(1) 

The Company completed an acquisition in the Optical Communications segment during the second quarter of 2016 with a purchase price of $296 million. 

(2) 

In the third quarter of 2016, minor adjustments were made to the preliminary allocation of the total purchase consideration related to a second quarter acquisition.  The allocation is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2016, and any adjustments are not expected to be material. 

Corning s gross goodwill balances for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $8.1 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.  Accumulated impairment losses were $6.5 billion for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and were generated primarily through goodwill impairments related to the Optical Communications segment.

Other intangible assets are as follows (in millions): 

Corning s amortized intangible assets are primarily related to the Optical Communications and Life Sciences segments.  The net carrying amount of intangible assets increased during the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to acquisitions of $127 million of other intangible assets and foreign currency translation adjustments of $11 million, offset by amortization of $46 million. 

Amortization expense related to these intangible assets is estimated to be $67 million for 2016, $72 million annually from 2017 to 2018, $71 million for 2019, and $66 million annually from 2020 to 2021.

14.      Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value standards under U.S. GAAP define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and require disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standards also identify two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels (provided in the table below) used to measure fair value.  Fair value standards apply whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and require the use of observable market data when available.

The following tables provide fair value measurement information for the Company s major categories of financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis (in millions): 

(1) 

Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange forward and zero-cost collar contracts, and interest rate swaps which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. 

(2) 

Other assets include asset-backed securities which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and contingent consideration assets or liabilities which are measured by applying an option pricing model using projected future revenue and forecasted foreign exchange rates.

Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. 

(2) 

Other assets include asset-backed securities which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and contingent consideration assets or liabilities which are measured by applying an option pricing model using projected future revenues. 

As a result of the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials in January 2014, the Company has contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.  Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration in future periods are valued using an option pricing model and are recorded in Corning s results in the period of the change.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the potential receipt of the contingent consideration in 2018 was $286 million and $246 million, respectively.

There were no significant financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

15.      Shareholders  Equity 

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A 

On January 15, 2014, Corning designated a new series of its preferred stock as Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $100 per share, and issued 2,300 shares of Preferred Stock at an issue price of $1 million per share, for an aggregate issue price of $2.3 billion.  The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning s common stock per one share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of September 30, 2016, the Preferred Stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered. 

Share Repurchases 

On July 28, 2016, Corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction ( ASR ) with Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( Morgan Stanley ) to repurchase $2 billion of Corning s common stock in two tranches of $1.5 billion and $500 million, respectively, each with its own scheduled termination date.  The ASR was executed under the $4 billion share repurchase program authorized on October 26, 2015 (the  2015 Repurchase Program ).  Under the ASR, Corning made a $2 billion aggregate payment to Morgan Stanley on July 28, 2016 and received an initial aggregate delivery of 74.4 million shares of Corning common stock from Morgan Stanley on the same day.  Each tranche is subject to acceleration at Morgan Stanley s option during an acceleration period prior to its scheduled termination date.  The total number of shares Corning will repurchase under each tranche of the ASR will be based generally upon the average daily volume weighted average price of Corning s common stock during the repurchase period for such tranche, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR.  Depending on the circumstances at settlement of each tranche, Morgan Stanley may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to Corning or Corning may be required either to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment to Morgan Stanley.  Final settlement of both tranches of the ASR is scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In addition to the ASR, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 15.3 million and 96 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $340 million and $1,901 million, respectively, as part of its 2015 Repurchase Program. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the primary changes in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) were related to the foreign currency translation adjustment component and the unamortized actuarial losses component. 

A summary of changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI is as follows (in millions):

16.      Share-based Compensation 

Stock Compensation Plans 

The Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.  Fair values for stock options were estimated using a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model.  Share-based compensation cost was approximately $10 million and $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $33 million and $36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Amounts for all periods presented included compensation expense for employee stock options and time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.

Stock Options 

Corning s stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued shares, or treasury shares, at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from one to five years from the grant date.  The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is 10 years from the grant date. 

The following table summarizes information concerning stock options outstanding including the related transactions under the stock option plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The aggregate intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the Company s closing stock price on September 30, 2016, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their  in-the-money  options as of that date. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the plans.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.  Compensation cost related to stock options was approximately $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $10 million and $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $86 million and $99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were included in financing activities on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $36 million and $46 million, respectively.  The income tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Refer to Note 5 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following inputs were used for the valuation of option grants under our stock option plans: 

Expected volatility is based on a blended approach defined as the weighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term, and the most recent 15-year historical volatility.  The expected term assumption is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding, and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options being valued, and partial life cycles of outstanding options.  The risk-free rate assumption is the implied rate for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the option s expected term. 

Incentive Stock Plans 

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.  Restricted stock and restricted stock units under the Incentive Stock Plan are granted at the closing market price on the grant date, contingently vest over a period of generally one to ten years, and generally have contractual lives of one to ten years.  The fair value of each restricted stock grant or restricted stock unit awarded under the Incentive Stock Plan is based on the grant date closing price of the Company s stock. 

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units:  

Time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and are payable in shares of the Company s common stock upon vesting.  The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company s stock on the grant date.  Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures before vesting. 

The following table represents a summary of the status of the Company s non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2015, and changes which occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

24 

As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $31 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.  Compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units was approximately $8 million and $9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

OVERVIEW 

Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework  

In October 2015, Corning announced a new strategy and capital allocation framework that reflects the Company s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. 

Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  Over the next four years, Corning will concentrate approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  This strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed. 

Our financial strength also allows us to increase our return to shareholders.  Through 2019, we expect to generate and deploy over $26 billion and return greater than $12.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  We intend to increase our dividend per common share by at least 10% annually through 2019.

Investing in our Future 

Corning is one of the world s leading innovators in materials science.  For more than 160 years, Corning has applied its unparalleled expertise in specialty glass, ceramics, and optical physics to develop products that have created new industries and transformed people s lives.  In the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, our spending on research, development and engineering was $187 million and $569 million, respectively, consistent with the same periods in 2015.  We continue to maintain our innovation strategy focusing on growing our existing businesses, developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities, and investing in long-range opportunities in each of our market segments.  We continue to make investments aimed at developing new products, including glass substrates for high-performance displays and LCD applications, precision glass for advanced displays, emission control products for cars, trucks and off-road vehicles, products that accelerate drug discovery and manufacturing and the optical fiber, cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber-to-the-premises, and next generation data centers.  In addition, we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications, such as distributed antenna systems.  We have also focused our research, development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our Corning  Gorilla  Glass suite of products, including Gorilla Glass in automotive and architectural markets.  We will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes, including Corning  Willow  Glass, our ultra-slim flexible glass substrate for use in next-generation consumer electronic and architectural applications.  

Summary of results for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 

Net sales in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 were $2.5 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, compared to $2.3 billion and $6.9 billion in the same periods in 2015.  Net sales increased in all of our segments in the third quarter of 2016, led by the Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments, up $145 million and $48 million, respectively.  The increase in sales in the first three quarters of 2016 was driven by the Display Technologies segment and the Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business, which increased by $54 million and $80 million, respectively.  Lower sales in the Optical Communications segment due to production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which limited our ability to fulfill customer orders in the first half of 2016, partially offset the increase in these segments. 

In the third quarter of 2016, we generated net income of $284 million or $0.26 per share, compared to net income of $212 million or $0.15 per share for the same period in 2015.  The increase in net income was driven by the following items (amounts presented after-tax): 

The decrease in unrealized losses from our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings in the amount of $50 million; 

An increase in net income of $24 million in the Display Technologies, driven by an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms, the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment in the amount of $51 million and improvements in manufacturing efficiency, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly above 10%; and 

An increase in net income of $8 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven by an increase in fiber-to-the-home products volume, favorable product mix and improvements in manufacturing efficiency. 

Partially offsetting these events were the following items: 

A decrease of $20 million in equity earnings as a result of our strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning; and 

Pension mark-to-market adjustments of $17 million resulting from small settlements in several of our benefit plans.

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected Corning s consolidated net income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $83 million when compared to the same period in 2015, largely due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen.  This impact was offset by a decrease of $105 million in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges. 

In the first three quarters of 2016, we generated net income of $2,123 million or $1.81 per share, compared to net income of $1,115 million or $0.82 per share for the same period in 2015.  The increase in net income in the first nine months of 2016 was driven by the following items (amounts presented after tax): 

A $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning completed on May 31, 2016; and 

The gain of $25 million on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation. 

Partially offsetting these events were the following items: 

The increase in unrealized losses from our foreign currency translation hedges in the amount of $1,257 million; 

Lower net income in the Display Technologies segment, down $160 million, or 19%, primarily driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10% and a decrease of $220 million in net realized gains from our yen and won-denominated currency hedge contracts, offset somewhat by an increase in volume and the positive impact on operations from the strengthening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate; 

A decrease in net income of $32 million, or 16%, in the Optical Communications segment, driven by lower sales primarily due to production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which limited our ability to fulfill customer orders in the first half of 2016; and 

The resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and related costs in the total amount of $86 million. 

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected Corning s consolidated net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $171 million when compared to the same period in 2015, largely due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.  This impact was offset by a decrease of $215 million in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges. 

2016 Corporate Outlook 

Corning expects its Display Technologies segment to experience continued moderate sequential LCD glass price declines in the fourth quarter.  For the full year we expect the LCD glass market and our LCD glass demand to grow in the mid-single digit percentage year over year.  We anticipate that sales in the Optical Communications segment will grow by a high-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter driven by strong fiber-to-the-home demand, resulting in low-single digits growth for the full-year.  In the Environmental Technologies segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be down low-single digits versus the fourth quarter last year driven by continued weakness in the heavy-duty truck markets, resulting in sales being down slightly for the full year.  In the Specialty Materials segment we expect high-single digit growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter, resulting in sales being down slightly for the full year.  We will continue to execute our strategy and capital allocation framework begun in the fourth quarter of 2015, under which we plan to grow and sustain our leadership position in our markets and return more than $12.5 billion to shareholders through 2019.

Net Sales 

The following table presents net sales by reportable segment (in millions): 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net sales increased by $235 million, or 10%, when compared to the same period in 2015.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows: 

An increase of $145 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $138 million and an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms, partially offset by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%; 

An increase of $48 million in the Optical Communications segment primarily due to higher sales of fiber-to-the-home products in North America; 

An increase of $7 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by record quarterly sales of light-duty substrate products due to market strength in North America, Europe and China; 

An increase of $7 million in the Specialty Materials segment; 

An increase of $3 million in the Life Sciences segment; and 

An increase of $25 million in the All Other segment, driven by the acquisition of a glass tubing business and the formation of the Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net sales increased by $34 million when compared to the same period in 2015.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows: 

An increase of $54 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $274 million and a low-single digit percentage volume increase, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%; 

A decrease of $58 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven primarily by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software; 

A decrease of $12 million in the Environmental Technologies segment driven by lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products due to the weakening of the North American truck market, offset partially by an increase in sales of light-duty substrates, driven by strength in the North American and European markets; 

A decrease of $44 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by a decline in volume of Corning Gorilla Glass products; 

An increase of $14 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by volume growth in Europe, North America and China; and 

An increase of $80 million in the All Other segment, driven by the acquisition of a glass tubing business and the formation of the Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, positively impacted Corning s consolidated net sales by $133 million and $246 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015.

Cost of Sales 

The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. 

Gross Margin 

In the three months ended September 30, 2016, gross margin dollars and gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased when compared to the same period last year, up $149 million and 3%, respectively, driven by higher sales, cost reductions and improvements in manufacturing efficiency in the majority of our segments.  The Optical Communications segment experienced the largest increase, driven by an increase in volume and favorable product mix. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross margin dollars and gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the same period last year, down $40 million and 1%, respectively.  The decrease was primarily driven by LCD glass price declines in the Display Technologies segment and the impact of a power outage that temporarily halted production at our Tainan, Taiwan manufacturing location in the first half of 2016, resulting in asset write-offs and charges for facility repairs.  Additionally, in the first half of 2016, gross margin was negatively impacted by issues with a manufacturing software implementation in the Optical Communications segment which limited our ability to fulfill customer orders.  Lower manufacturing costs in the Specialty Materials segment and the stronger Japanese yen and Korean won versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate partially offset the decline in these periods. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

When compared to the third quarter of 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, driven by the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $61 million, offset somewhat by an increase of $26 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans resulting from small settlements in several of our benefit plans and $25 million in higher variable compensation and benefit expenses. 

When compared to the first three quarters of 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $144 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, driven by the following items: 

An increase of $58 million in acquisition-related costs primarily related to the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning and an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016; 

An increase of $60 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter, partially offset by the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation; 

An increase of $52 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans; and 

Higher operating expenses in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments. 

The positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $40 million and a decrease of $25 million in post-combination expenses, which were higher in 2015 due to the completion of four acquisitions, partially offset the increases detailed above. 

The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; stock-based compensation expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, research, development and engineering expenses and as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent with the same periods last year. 

Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies 

The following provides a summary of equity in earnings of affiliated companies (in millions): 

(1)   

Results include equity earnings for Dow Corning, which includes the silicones business and Hemlock Semiconductor business, through May 31, 2016, the date of the realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning. 

(2)   

Results include equity earnings for Hemlock Semiconductor Group beginning on June 1, 2016. 

On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation ( Dow Corning ) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced on December 10, 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and approximately $4.8 billion in cash. 

The equity in earnings line on our income statement for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (Hemlock Semiconductor) businesses of Dow Corning from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016, the closing date of the Transaction Agreement, and four months of equity earnings from Hemlock Semiconductor Group.  Prior to the realignment of Dow Corning, equity earnings from the Hemlock Semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in Corning s income statement, net of Dow Corning s 35% U.S. tax.  Additionally, Corning reported its tax on equity earnings from Dow Corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a U.S. tax provision rate of 7%.  As part of the realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group was converted to a partnership.  Each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  Therefore, post-realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and Corning s tax is reported on the tax provision line.

Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes 

Our benefit (provision) for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): 

2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 

36 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits: 

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits: 

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income; 

The impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax; and 

The tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to Corning s tax on Dow Corning s undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits: 

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of high-taxed foreign earnings in U.S. income; and 

The impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials, net of tax.

Comprehensive Income 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, comprehensive income increased by $535 million and $2,600 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015, driven by the following items: 

An increase in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of $72 million and $1,008 million, respectively; 

The positive impact due to the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $426 million and $1,346 million, respectively, largely driven by the strengthening of the Japanese yen; and 

The change in the amount of unamortized actuarial losses released in the amounts of $11 million and $248 million, respectively.  The significant change in the first three quarters of 2016 was driven by the release of Dow Corning s unamortized actuarial loss in the amount of $260 million, which was included in the gain on the realignment of our ownership interests in Dow Corning. 

Refer to Note 15 (Shareholders  Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures.  We believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the Japanese yen and South Korean won, and uses an internally derived yen-to-dollar management rate of  99 and won-to-dollar management rate of  1,100. 

Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the South Korean won, gains and losses on our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, acquisition-related costs, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.  Management s discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate.  These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( GAAP ).  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.  With respect to the Company s outlooks for future periods, it is not able to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen and South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company s control.  As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis. 

See  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for details on core performance measures.  For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  below.

Core Net Sales 

The following table presents core net sales by reportable segment (in millions): 

Core net sales increased by $97 million and decreased by $239 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015.  In all segments except Display Technologies, core net sales are consistent with GAAP net sales.  Because a significant portion of revenues in the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen, this segment s net sales are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars. 

When compared to the third quarter of 2015, core net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $7 million, or 1%, in the third quarter of 2016, driven by an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%. 

When compared to the first three quarters of 2015, core net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $219 million, or 8%, in the first three quarters of 2016, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%. 

Core Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies 

The following provides a summary of core equity in earnings of affiliated companies (in millions): 

(1)   

Results include equity earnings for Dow Corning, which includes the silicones business and Hemlock Semiconductor business, through May 31, 2016, the date of the realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning. 

(2)   

Results include equity earnings for Hemlock Semiconductor Group beginning on June 1, 2016. 

Core Earnings 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated core earnings of $466 million or $0.42 per share and $1,240 million, or $1.06 per share, respectively, compared to $447 million or $0.34 per share and $1,453 million or $1.06 per share, respectively, in the same periods in 2015.  The increase of $19 million in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to an increase in core earnings of $27 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven by an increase in fiber-to-the-home products volume, favorable product mix and improvements in manufacturing efficiency.  Display Technologies core earnings also increased, up $13 million, driven by an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms and improvements in manufacturing efficiency, offset somewhat by the LCD glass price declines slightly above 10%.  The decrease of $213 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by lower core earnings in the Display Technologies segment, down $111 million, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%.

The following table sets forth the computation of core basic and core diluted earnings per common share (in millions, except per share amounts): 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows. 

Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company s operations.

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows: 

(1) 

Constant-currency adjustments: 

Constant-yen :   Because a significant portion of Display Technologies segment revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars.  Presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts.  As of January 1, 2015, we used an internally derived management rate of  99, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen. 

Constant-won :   Because a significant portion of Corning Precision Materials  costs are denominated in South Korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars.  Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the South Korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency.  We use an internally derived management rate of  1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won. 

(2) 

Foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings :   We have excluded the impact of the gains and losses of our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings for each period presented. 

(3) 

Acquisition-related costs :   These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs. 

(4) 

Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments :   This represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and other non-operational tax-related adjustments. 

(5) 

Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters :   Includes amounts related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters. 

(6) 

Restructuring, impairment and other charges :   This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, including goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense. 

(7) 

Equity in earnings of affiliated companies :   These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under  take-or-pay  contracts. 

(8) 

Impacts from the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials :   Fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and other items related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials. 

(9) 

Post-combination expenses :   Post-combination expenses incurred as a result of an acquisition in the first quarter of 2015. 

(10) 

Pension mark-to-market adjustment :   Mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates. 

(11) 

Gain on realignment of equity investment :   Gain recorded upon the completion of the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning. 

(12) 

Taiwan power outage :   Impact of the power outage that temporarily halted production at our Tainan, Taiwan manufacturing location in the first half of 2016.  The impact includes asset write-offs and charges for facility repairs, offset somewhat by partial reimbursement through our insurance program.  We expect to receive the remainder of the insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2016.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

Our reportable segments are as follows: 

Display Technologies   manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel liquid crystal displays. 

Optical Communications   manufactures carrier and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry. 

Environmental Technologies   manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications. 

Specialty Materials   manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. 

Life Sciences   manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications. 

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as  All Other.   This group is primarily comprised of the results of Corning s Pharmaceutical Technologies business, which consists of a pharmaceutical glass business and a glass tubing business used in the pharmaceutical packaging industry.  This segment also includes Corning Precision Materials  non-LCD business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates. 

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Our reportable segments include non-GAAP measures which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.  For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  above.  Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

As Reported 

Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $145 million, or 19%, in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The increase was driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $138 million and an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms, partially offset by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%.  Net income increased by $24 million, or 9%, in the third quarter of 2016, when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The increase was driven by the positive impact of the strengthening of the yen in the amount of $72 million, an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms, the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment in the amount of $51 million and improvements in manufacturing efficiency, offset somewhat by the LCD glass price declines described above and a decrease of $104 million in the realized gain from our yen and won-denominated currency hedges. 

Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $54 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $274 million and a low-single digit percentage volume increase, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%.  Net income decreased by $160 million, or 19%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease was driven primarily by the LCD glass price declines described above and a decrease of $220 million in the realized gain from our yen and won-denominated currency hedges, offset partially by the impact of the strengthening of the yen of $140 million, an increase in volume in the low-single digit percentage, the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment in the amount of $38 million, improvements in manufacturing efficiency and a decline in operating expenses. 

Core Performance 

Core net sales increased in the third quarter of 2016 by $7 million, or 1%, when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by an increase in volume in the low-teens in percentage terms, partially offset by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%.  Core earnings also increased in the third quarter of 2016, up $13 million, or 5%, driven by the increase in volume described above, improvements in manufacturing efficiency and a decline in operating expenses.  LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10% partially offset the increase. 

Core net sales decreased by $219 million, or 8%, in the first three quarters of 2016, when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a low-single digit percentage volume increase.  Core earnings also decreased in this period, down $111 million, or 13%, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a low-single digit percentage volume increase, improvements in manufacturing efficiency and a decline in operating expenses.

Outlook:  

The company expects panel maker utilization to remain high and for LCD glass supply to remain tight in the fourth quarter.  Sequentially, fourth-quarter volume is expected to be consistent to slightly down, in line with the glass market. 

Optical Communications 

The following tables provide net sales and net income for the Optical Communications segment and reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures for the Optical Communications segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP (in millions): 

See Part 1, Item 2.

As Reported 

Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $48 million, or 6%, in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase was due to higher sales of fiber-to-the-home products in North America and the impact of an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016.  Net income in the third quarter of 2016 increased by $8 million, or 11%, when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by an increase in volume, favorable product mix and improvements in manufacturing efficiency, offset slightly by higher operating expenses driven by restructuring, impairment and other charges and pension mark-to-market costs.  Movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted segment net sales in the amount of $2 million and net income in the amount of $3 million in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.

Net sales and net income in the Optical Communications segment decreased by $58 million, or 3%, and $32 million, or 16%, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.  This decline was driven by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016.  Production returned to normal levels at the end of the second quarter, and the increase in volume in the third quarter partially offset the lower first half results.  Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted segment net sales in the amount of $6 million and positively impacted net income in the amount of $10 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. 

Core Performance 

Core earnings increased in the third quarter of 2016 by $27 million, or 38%, respectively, driven by an increase in volume, favorable product mix and improvements in manufacturing efficiency.  Core earnings were lower in the first nine months of 2016, down $24 million, or 10%, driven by the production issues described above, offset slightly by higher sales in the third quarter of 2016.  Movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted core earnings in the amounts of $3 million and $10 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in 2015. 

Outlook : 

In the fourth quarter, Corning expects Optical Communications sales to increase by a high-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis driven by continued fiber-to-the-home strength. 

Environmental Technologies 

The following table provides net sales and net income for the Environmental Technologies segment and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures for the Environmental Technologies segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP (in millions):

As Reported 

Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased by $7 million, or 3%, in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  Sales of light-duty substrate products were at record levels in the third quarter, driven by market strength in North America, Europe and China.  Lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products in North America and China partially offset this increase.  Net income in the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $3 million, or 8%, driven by increased expenses in support of new product launches.  Movements in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales and net income in this segment in the amounts of $5 million and $2 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.

49 

Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment decreased by $12 million, or 2%, in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by lower sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the North American truck market, offset partially by an increase in sales of light-duty substrates, driven by strength in the North American, European and Chinese markets.  Net income decreased by $26 million, or 20%, driven by lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products and increased expenses in support of new product launches.  Movements in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales and net income in this segment in the amounts of $15 million and $6 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. 

Core Performance 

Core earnings decreased by $3 million, or 8%, and $23 million, or 17%, in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, driven by the items impacting our As Reported results described above. 

Outlook : 

In the fourth quarter, the Company anticipates Environmental Technologies sales to be down by a low-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis driven by continued weakness in the heavy-duty truck markets.

As Reported 

Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $7 million, or 2%, in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by higher sales of advanced optics products and an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass volume.  Net income in the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $4 million, or 9%, impacted by ramp up costs associated with launch of new products, and customer mix.  Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net sales and net income in the Specialty Materials segment in the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. 

Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment decreased by $44 million, or 5%, in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a decrease in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products.  The mobile consumer electronics industry is experiencing lower smartphone and tablet demand in 2016, driven by worldwide macroeconomic conditions, fewer major product launches and longer repurchases cycles.  Net income decreased by $22 million, or 17%, driven by higher restructuring, impairment and other charges and the impact of a power outage that temporarily halted production at our Tainan, Taiwan manufacturing location.  Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net sales and net income in the Specialty Materials segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. 

Core Performance 

Core earnings in the third quarter of 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015.  Core earnings declined by $10 million, or 7%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, driven primarily by a decline in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products and higher research and development costs. 

Outlook : 

Fourth-quarter segment sales are expected to increase by a high-single digit percentage year over year driven by volume growth in Corning Gorilla Glass.

51 

As Reported 

Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $3 million, or 1%, in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by volume growth in Europe, North America and China, slightly offset by the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of $2 million.  Net income declined by $2 million, or 11%, driven by the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. 

Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $14 million, or 2%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by volume growth in Europe, North America and China, slightly offset by the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of $7 million.  Net income declined by $7 million, or 13%, driven by the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. 

Core Performance 

Core earnings in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were consistent with the prior year. 

Outlook : 

Fourth-quarter sales are expected to grow by a low single-digit percentage when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 

All Other 

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as  All Other.   This group is primarily comprised of the results of Corning s Pharmaceutical Technologies business, which consists of a pharmaceutical glass business and a glass tubing business used in the pharmaceutical packaging industry.  This segment also includes Corning Precision Materials  non-LCD business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates. 

The following table provides net sales and other data for All Other (in millions): 

The increase in net sales of this segment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the impact of an acquisition in the Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.  The increase in the net loss of this segment was driven by asset write-offs in emerging businesses, offset slightly by the addition of the Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies business net income. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Financing and Capital Resources 

The following items impacted Corning s financing and capital structure in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

2016  

On July 20, 2016, Corning s Board of Directors approved a $1 billion increase to our commercial paper program, raising it to $2 billion.  If needed, this program is supported by our $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2019. 

2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 

52 

2015  

In the second quarter of 2015, we issued $375 million of 1.50% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 8, 2018 and $375 million of 2.90% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 15, 2022.  The net proceeds of $745 million will be used for general corporate purposes.  We can redeem these debentures at any time, subject to certain stipulations. 

Common Stock Dividends 

On February 3, 2016, Corning s Board of Directors declared a 12.5% increase in the Company s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.135 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2016. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On July 28, 2016, Corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction ( ASR ) with Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( Morgan Stanley ) to repurchase $2 billion of Corning s common stock in two tranches of $1.5 billion and $500 million, respectively, each with its own scheduled termination date.  The ASR was executed under the $4 billion share repurchase program authorized on October 26, 2015 (the  2015 Repurchase Program ).  Under the ASR, Corning made a $2 billion aggregate payment to Morgan Stanley on July 28, 2016 and received an initial aggregate delivery of 74.4 million shares of Corning common stock from Morgan Stanley on the same day.  Each tranche is subject to acceleration at Morgan Stanley s option during an acceleration period prior to its scheduled termination date.  The total number of shares Corning will repurchase under each tranche of the ASR will be based generally upon the average daily volume weighted average price of Corning s common stock during the repurchase period for such tranche, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR.  Depending on the circumstances at settlement of each tranche, Morgan Stanley may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to Corning or Corning may be required either to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment to Morgan Stanley.  Final settlement of both tranches of the ASR is scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In addition to the ASR, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 15.3 million and 96 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $340 million and $1,901 million, respectively, as part of its 2015 Repurchase Program. 

Capital Spending 

Capital spending totaled $815 million and $939 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Spending in the first nine months of 2016 was driven primarily by the Display Technologies segment, and focused on finishing line optimization and tank rebuilds.  We expect our 2016 capital spending to be approximately $1.2 billion. 

Cash Flow 

Summary of cash flow data (in millions): 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $750 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period last year, driven largely by a decline of $123 million in dividends received from equity affiliates primarily driven by the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning and an increase in accounts receivable in all of our segments, notably in the Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments, offset somewhat by a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities.

53 

Net cash provided by investing activities increased substantially in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period last year, driven by the cash received on the realignment of Dow Corning, lower capital expenditures and a decrease in acquisition spending, offset slightly by a decrease in realized gains on our translated earnings contracts. 

Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in share repurchases, net commercial paper repayments and the absence of cash received from the issuance of long-term debt in the third quarter of 2015. 

Key Balance Sheet Data 

Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): 

(1) 

Includes trade payables only. 

Credit Rating 

Our credit ratings remain the same as those disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Management Assessment of Liquidity 

We ended the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $4.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $321 million from December 31, 2015.  We believe the Company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet reasonably likely future cash requirements.  Our cash and cash equivalents, which are generally unrestricted, are held in various locations throughout the world, with approximately 64% of the consolidated amount held outside of the United States at September 30, 2016.  We believe we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.

Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes.  On July 20, 2016, Corning s Board of Directors approved an increase to the allowable maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time from $1 billion to $2 billion.  Under this program, the Company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  The Company s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2016. 

Other 

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues. 

Our major source of funding for 2016 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, acquisitions, the asbestos litigation, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments and share repurchase programs. 

Corning has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility.  This credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%.  At September 30, 2016, our leverage using this measure was approximately 18% and we are in compliance with the financial covenant. 

Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.   As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such provisions. 

Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.  In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our off balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K under the caption  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.  

Contractual Obligations 

There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the    contractual    obligations disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K    under the caption  Contractual    Obligations.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  The estimates that required management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2015 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first nine months of 2016.  For certain items, additional details are provided below.

Impairment of Assets Held for Use 

We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. 

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life.  Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  This review considers all of the Company s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $868 million and $976 million, respectively.  These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

ENVIRONMENT 

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency ( the Agency ) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Corning had accrued approximately $45 million (undiscounted) and $37 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on Forms 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as  will,   believe,   anticipate,   expect,   intend,   plan,   seek,   see,   would,  and  target  and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market Risk Disclosures 

As noted in our 2015 Form 10-K, we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies.  Volatility in the global financial markets could increase the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates which would, in turn, impact our sales and net income.  For a discussion of our exposure to market risk and how we mitigate that risk, refer to Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks, contained in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company entered into a series of average rate forwards with no associated premium, which partially hedge the impact of Japanese yen translation on the Company s projected 2018 through 2022 net income.  At September 30, 2016 the total gross notional value for the yen translated earnings contracts was $16.0 billion (at December 31, 2015: $8.3 billion), including zero-cost collars of $1.5 billion (at December 31, 2015: $2.0 billion) and average rate forwards of $14.5 billion (at December 31, 2015: $6.3 billion).  With respect to the zero-cost collars, the gross notional amount includes the value of both the put and call options.  However, due to the nature of the zero-cost collars, either the put or the call option can be exercised at maturity.  As of September 30, 2016, the total net notional value of the zero-cost collars was $0.7 billion (at December 31, 2015: $1.0 billion). 

The fair value of our unsettled foreign exchange forward and option contracts is most significantly impacted by fluctuations in the Japanese yen.  At September 30, 2016, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in Japanese yen exchange rates could result in an unrealized loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.8 billion (at December 31, 2015: $0.7 billion).  Changes in fair values of these instruments are ultimately offset in the period of settlement by changes in the fair value of the underlying exposure.  Prior to settlement, the unrealized fair value changes could cause material volatility in our earnings.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision of and with the participation of Corning s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date.  Corning s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning s management, including Corning s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting was also performed to determine whether any changes have occurred during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  The chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that there was no change in Corning s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

exhibit10_1.htm 

Exhibit 10.1 

This master confirmation (this   Master Confirmation  ), dated as of July 28, 2016, is intended to set forth certain terms and provisions of certain Transactions (each, a   Transaction  ) entered into from time to time between Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC (  Dealer  ), and Corning Incorporated, a New York corporation (  Counterparty  ).  This Master Confirmation, taken alone, is neither a commitment by either party to enter into any Transaction nor evidence of a Transaction.  The additional terms of any particular Transaction shall be set forth in a Supplemental Confirmation in the form of Schedule A hereto (a   Supplemental Confirmation  ), which shall reference this Master Confirmation and supplement, form a part of, and be subject to this Master Confirmation.  This Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation together shall constitute a  Confirmation  as referred to in the Agreement specified below. 

The definitions and provisions contained in the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the   Equity Definitions  ), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., are incorporated into this Master Confirmation.  This Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation evidence a complete binding agreement between Counterparty and Dealer as to the subject matter and terms of each Transaction to which this Master Confirmation and such Supplemental Confirmation relate and shall supersede all prior or contemporaneous written or oral communications with respect thereto. 

This Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation supplement, form a part of, and are subject to an agreement in the form of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (the   Agreement  ) as if Dealer and Counterparty had executed the Agreement on the date of this Master Confirmation (but without any Schedule except for (i) the election of New York law as the governing law (without reference to its choice of law provisions) ; the election that Multiple Transaction Payment Netting apply; (iii) the election that, in Section 5(a)(i) of the Agreement, each occurrence of the word  first  in the third line thereof shall be replaced with  third  and (iv) such other elections set forth in this Master Confirmation. 

The Transactions shall be the sole Transactions under the Agreement.  If there exists any ISDA Master Agreement between Dealer and Counterparty or any confirmation or other agreement between Dealer and Counterparty pursuant to which an ISDA Master Agreement is deemed to exist between Dealer and Counterparty, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such ISDA Master Agreement, such confirmation or agreement or any other agreement to which Dealer and Counterparty are parties, the Transactions shall not be considered Transactions under, or otherwise governed by, such existing or deemed ISDA Master Agreement, and the occurrence of any Event of Default or Termination Event under the Agreement with respect to either party or any Transaction shall not, by itself, give rise to any right or obligation under any such other agreement or deemed agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement between the parties or their Affiliates, the Transactions shall not be  Specified Transactions  (or similarly treated) under any other agreement between the parties or their Affiliates. 

All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in the Agreement shall govern this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation except as expressly modified herein or in the related Supplemental Confirmation. 

If, in relation to any Transaction to which this Master Confirmation and a Supplemental Confirmation relate, there is any inconsistency between the Agreement, this Master Confirmation, such Supplemental Confirmation and the Equity Definitions, the following will prevail for purposes of such Transaction in the order of precedence indicated: (i) such Supplemental Confirmation; (ii) this Master Confirmation; (iii) the Equity Definitions; and (iv) the Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Equity Definitions, if a Disrupted Day occurs (i) in the Calculation Period, the Calculation Agent may, in its good faith and commercially reasonable discretion, postpone the Scheduled Termination Date, or (ii) in the Settlement Valuation Period, the Calculation Agent may extend the Settlement Valuation Period.  The Calculation Agent may also determine that (i) such Disrupted Day is a Disrupted Day in full, in which case the VWAP Price for such Disrupted Day shall not be included for purposes of determining the Forward Price or the Settlement Price, as the case may be, or (ii) such Disrupted Day is a Disrupted Day only in part, in which case the VWAP Price for such Disrupted Day shall be determined by the Calculation Agent based on Rule 10b-18-compliant transactions in the Shares on such Disrupted Day taking into account the nature and duration of the relevant Market Disruption Event, and the weighting of the VWAP Price for the relevant Exchange Business Days during the Calculation Period or the Settlement Valuation Period, as the case may be, shall be adjusted in a commercially reasonable manner by the Calculation Agent for purposes of determining the Forward Price or the Settlement Price, as the case may be, with such adjustments based on, among other factors, the duration of any Market Disruption Event and the volume, historical trading patterns and price of the Shares; provided, however, that any Market Disruption Event due to a Regulatory Disruption shall be a Disrupted Day in full.  Any Exchange Business Day on which, as of the date hereof, the Exchange is scheduled to close prior to its normal close of trading shall be deemed not to be an Exchange Business Day; if a closure of the Exchange prior to its normal close of trading on any Exchange Business Day is scheduled following the date hereof, then such Exchange Business Day shall be deemed to be a Disrupted Day in full. 

If a Disrupted Day occurs during the Calculation Period for any Transaction or the Settlement Valuation Period for any Transaction, as the case may be, and each of the nine immediately following Scheduled Trading Days is a Disrupted Day (a   Disruption Event  ), then the Calculation Agent, in its good faith and commercially reasonable discretion, may deem such Disruption Event (and each consecutive Disrupted Day thereafter) to be either (x) a Potential Adjustment Event in respect of such Transaction or (y) an Additional Termination Event in respect of such Transaction, with Counterparty as the sole Affected Party and such Transaction as the sole Affected Transaction.

(i) 

will not during the period commencing on the Trade Date for any Transaction and ending on the last day of the Relevant Period or, if applicable, the later of the last day of the Settlement Valuation Period and the last day of the Seller Termination Purchase Period, for such Transaction make, or to the extent it is within its reasonable control, permit to be made, any public announcement (as defined in Rule 165(f) under the Securities Act) of any Merger Transaction or potential Merger Transaction (a   Merger Announcement  ) unless such Merger Announcement is made prior to the opening or after the close of the regular trading session on the Exchange for the Shares; 

(ii) 

shall promptly (but in any event prior to the next opening of the regular trading session on the Exchange) notify Dealer following any such Merger Announcement that such Merger Announcement has been made; and 

(iii) 

shall promptly (but in any event prior to the next opening of the regular trading session on the Exchange) provide Dealer with written notice specifying (i) Counterparty s average daily Rule 10b-18 Purchases (as defined in Rule 10b-18) during the three full calendar months immediately preceding the announcement date of any Merger Transaction or potential Merger Transaction that were not effected through Dealer or its Affiliates and (ii) the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the proviso in Rule 10b-18(b)(4) under the Exchange Act for the three full calendar months preceding the announcement date of any Merger Transaction or potential Merger Transaction.

In addition, Counterparty shall promptly notify Dealer of the earlier to occur of the completion of such transaction and the completion of the vote by target shareholders. 

(b)

If an Acquisition Transaction Announcement occurs after the Trade Date, but prior to the First Acceleration Date of any Transaction, the First Acceleration Date shall be the date of such Acquisition Transaction Announcement.

For the avoidance of doubt, announcements as used in the definition of Acquisition Transaction Announcement refer to any public announcement whether made by the Issuer or a third party. 

(c) 

Acquisition Transaction   means (i) any Merger Event (for purposes of this definition the definition of Merger Event shall be read with the references therein to  100%  being replaced by  25%  and references to  50%  being replaced by  75%  and without reference to the clause beginning immediately following the definition of Reverse Merger therein to the end of such definition), Tender Offer or Merger Transaction or any other transaction involving the merger of Counterparty with or into any third party, (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Counterparty, (iii) a recapitalization, reclassification, binding share exchange or other similar transaction with respect to Counterparty, (iv) any acquisition by Counterparty or any of its subsidiaries where the aggregate consideration transferable by Counterparty or its subsidiaries exceeds 25% of the market capitalization of Counterparty, (v) any lease, exchange, transfer, disposition (including, without limitation, by way of spin-off or distribution) of assets (including, without limitation, any capital stock or other ownership interests in subsidiaries) or other similar event by Counterparty or any of its subsidiaries where the aggregate consideration transferable or receivable by or to Counterparty or its subsidiaries exceeds 25% of the market capitalization of Counterparty or (vi) any transaction in which Counterparty or its board of directors has a legal obligation to make a recommendation to its shareholders in respect of such transaction (whether pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or otherwise).

The  Equity Percentage  as of any day is the fraction, expressed as a percentage, (A) the numerator of which is the number of Shares that Dealer and any of its affiliates or any other person subject to aggregation with Dealer for purposes of the  beneficial ownership  test under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, or any  group  (within the meaning of Section 13) of which Dealer is or may be deemed to be a part beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act), without duplication, on such day (or, to the extent that for any reason the equivalent calculation under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder results in a higher number, such higher number) and (B) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such day. 

17. 

Maximum Share Delivery.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Master Confirmation, in no event shall Dealer be required to deliver any Shares, or any Shares or other securities comprising Alternative Delivery Units, in respect of any Transaction in excess of the Maximum Number of Shares set forth in the Supplemental Confirmation for such Transaction, as such number may be proportionately adjusted by the Calculation Agent to reflect stock splits or similar events. 

18. 

Additional Termination Events . 

(a) 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 of the Agreement, if a Termination Price is specified in the Supplemental Confirmation for any Transaction, then an Additional Termination Event will occur without any notice or action by Dealer or Counterparty if the closing price of the Shares on the Exchange for any two consecutive Exchange Business Days falls below such Termination Price and for the purposes of the Agreement, such second consecutive Exchange Business Day will be the  Early Termination Date  

19. 

Non-confidentiality.   Notwithstanding any provision in this Master Confirmation to the contrary, in connection with Section 1.6011-4 of the Treasury Regulations, the parties hereby agree that each party (and each employee, representative, or other agent of such party) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. tax treatment and U.S. tax structure of any Transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such U.S. tax treatment and U.S. tax structure, other than any information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.

21. 

Assignment and Transfer.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Dealer may assign any of its rights or duties hereunder to any one or more of its Affiliates organized in the United States (or any State thereof) or in England whose obligations hereunder are guaranteed by Dealer without the prior written consent of Counterparty subject to (A) the following conditions: 

(i) Counterparty will not be required to pay to the transferee an amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii), or 6(e)) greater than the amount in respect of which Counterparty would have been required to pay to Dealer  in the absence of such transfer; 

(ii) Counterparty will not receive a payment from which an amount has been withheld or deducted, on account of a Tax under Section 2(d)(i) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii), or 6(e) of the Agreement), in excess of that which Dealer would have been required to so withhold or deduct in the absence of such transfer, unless the transferee would be required to make additional payments pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement corresponding to such withholding or deduction; 

(iii) It is not unlawful for either party to perform any obligation under the Agreement or the Transaction as a result of such transfer; and 

(iv) An Extraordinary Event, Announcement Event, Potential Adjustment Event, Event of Default or Termination Event does not occur as a result of such transfer; 

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Master Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Dealer to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, Dealer may designate any of its Affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Dealer s obligations in respect of any Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations.  Dealer may assign the right to receive Settlement Shares to any third party who may legally receive Settlement Shares.  Dealer shall be discharged of its obligations to Counterparty only to the extent of any such performance.  For the avoidance of doubt, Dealer hereby acknowledges that notwithstanding any such designation hereunder, to the extent any of Dealer s obligations in respect of any Transaction are not completed by its designee, Dealer shall be obligated to continue to perform or to cause any other of its designees to perform in respect of such obligations.

If all of the conditions for delivery of either Registered Settlement Shares or Unregistered Settlement Shares have not been satisfied, Cash Settlement shall be applicable in accordance with paragraph 1 above notwithstanding Counterparty s election of Net Share Settlement. 

3.           Counterparty may only deliver Registered Settlement Shares pursuant to paragraph 2 above if: 

(a)           a registration statement covering public resale of the Registered Settlement Shares by Dealer (the   Registration Statement  ) shall have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act and been declared or otherwise become effective on or prior to the date of delivery, and no stop order shall be in effect with respect to the Registration Statement; a printed prospectus relating to the Registered Settlement Shares (including, without limitation, any prospectus supplement thereto, the   Prospectus  ) shall have been delivered to Dealer, in such quantities as Dealer shall reasonably have requested, on or prior to the date of delivery;

(d)           as of the date of delivery, an agreement (the   Underwriting Agreement  ) shall have been entered into with Dealer in connection with the public resale of the Registered Settlement Shares by Dealer substantially similar to underwriting agreements customary for underwritten offerings of equity securities, in form and substance satisfactory to Dealer, which Underwriting Agreement shall include, without limitation, provisions substantially similar to those contained in such underwriting agreements relating, without limitation, to the indemnification of, and contribution in connection with the liability of, Dealer and its Affiliates and the provision of customary opinions, accountants  comfort letters and lawyers  negative assurance letters.

Annex A - 2 

(c)           as of the date of delivery, Counterparty shall enter into an agreement (a   Private Placement Agreement  ) with Dealer (or any Affiliate of Dealer designated by Dealer) in connection with the private placement of such shares by Counterparty to Dealer (or any such Affiliate) and the private resale of such shares by Dealer (or any such Affiliate), substantially similar to private placement purchase agreements customary for private placements of equity securities, in form and substance commercially reasonably satisfactory to Dealer, which Private Placement Agreement shall include, without limitation, provisions substantially similar to those contained in such private placement purchase agreements relating, without limitation, to the indemnification of, and contribution in connection with the liability of, Dealer and its Affiliates and the provision of customary opinions, accountants  comfort letters and lawyers  negative assurance letters, and shall provide for the payment by Counterparty of all reasonable fees and actual, documented out-of-pocket expenses of Dealer (and any such Affiliate) in connection with such resale, including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and actual, documented out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for Dealer, and shall contain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Counterparty reasonably necessary or advisable to establish and maintain the availability of an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for such resales; and 

(d)           in connection with the private placement of such shares by Counterparty to Dealer (or any such Affiliate) and the private resale of such shares by Dealer (or any such Affiliate), Counterparty shall, if so requested by Dealer, prepare, in cooperation with Dealer, a private placement memorandum in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Dealer. 

5.           Dealer, itself or through an Affiliate (the   Selling Agent  ) or any underwriter(s), will sell all, or such lesser portion as may be required hereunder, of the Registered Settlement Shares or Unregistered Settlement Shares and any Makewhole Shares (as defined below) (together, the   Settlement Shares  ) delivered by Counterparty to Dealer pursuant to paragraph 6 below commencing on the Cash Settlement Payment Date and continuing until the date on which the aggregate Net Proceeds (as such term is defined below) of such sales, as determined by Dealer, is equal to the absolute value of the Forward Cash Settlement Amount (such date, the   Final Resale Date  ).  If Counterparty is prohibited by law or by contract from disclosing all material information known to Counterparty with respect to Counterparty and the Shares to any potential purchasers of such Settlement Shares, then the sale of such Settlement Shares shall not be required to commence or may be suspended until Counterparty is able to so disclose such information.   If  the proceeds of any sale(s) made by Dealer, the Selling Agent or any underwriter(s), net of any fees and commissions (including, without limitation, underwriting or placement fees) customary for similar transactions under the circumstances at the time of the offering, together with carrying charges and expenses incurred in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares (including, without limitation, the covering of any over-allotment or short position (syndicate or otherwise)) (the   Net Proceeds  ) exceed the absolute value of the Forward Cash Settlement Amount, Dealer will refund, in USD, such excess to Counterparty on the date that is three (3) Currency Business Days following the Final Resale Date, and, if any portion of the Settlement Shares remains unsold, Dealer shall return to Counterparty on that date such unsold Shares. 

6.           If the Calculation Agent determines that the Net Proceeds received from the sale of the Registered Settlement Shares or Unregistered Settlement Shares or any Makewhole Shares, if any, pursuant to this paragraph 6 are less than the absolute value of the Forward Cash Settlement Amount (the amount in USD by which the Net Proceeds are less than the absolute value of the Forward Cash Settlement Amount being the   Shortfall   and the date on which such determination is made, the   Deficiency Determination Date  ), Counterparty shall on the Exchange Business Day next succeeding the Deficiency Determination Date (the   Makewhole Notice Date  ) deliver to Dealer, through the Selling Agent, a notice of Counterparty s election that Counterparty shall either (i) pay an amount in cash equal to the Shortfall on the day that is one Currency Business Day after the Makewhole Notice Date, or (ii) deliver additional Shares.  If Counterparty elects to deliver to Dealer additional Shares, then Counterparty shall deliver additional Shares in compliance with the terms and conditions of paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 above, as the case may be (the   Makewhole Shares  ), on the first Clearance System Business Day which is also an Exchange Business Day following the Makewhole Notice Date in such number as the Calculation Agent reasonably believes would have a market value on that Exchange Business Day equal to the Shortfall.  Such Makewhole Shares shall be sold by Dealer in accordance with the provisions above;  provided  that if the sum of the Net Proceeds from the sale of the originally delivered Shares and the Net Proceeds from the sale of any Makewhole Shares is less than the absolute value of the Forward Cash Settlement Amount then Counterparty shall, at its election, either make such cash payment or deliver to Dealer further Makewhole Shares until such Shortfall has been reduced to zero.

Annex A - 3 

7.           Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate number of Settlement Shares for any Transaction be greater than the Reserved Shares  minus  the amount of any Shares actually delivered by Counterparty under any other Transaction under this Master Confirmation (the result of such calculation, the   Capped Number  ).  Counterparty represents and warrants (which shall be deemed to be repeated on each day that a Transaction is outstanding) that the Capped Number is equal to or less than the number of Shares determined according to the following formula: 

A   B 

Where 

A  = 

the number of authorized but unissued shares of Counterparty that are not reserved for future issuance on the date of the determination of the Capped Number; and 

B  = 

the maximum number of Shares required to be delivered to third parties if Counterparty elected Net Share Settlement of all transactions in the Shares (other than Transactions in the Shares under this Master Confirmation) with all third parties that are then currently outstanding and unexercised. 

Reserved Shares   means initially, 200,000,000 Shares.  The Reserved Shares may be increased or decreased in a Supplemental Confirmation. 

If at any time, as a result of this paragraph 7, Counterparty fails to deliver to Dealer any Settlement Shares, Counterparty shall, to the extent that Counterparty has at such time authorized but unissued Shares not reserved for other purposes, promptly notify Dealer thereof and deliver to Dealer a number of Shares not previously delivered as a result of this paragraph 7.
