  (Unaudited) 

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation 
    
  Substantially all of the assets, liabilities and operations of LCNB Corp. ("LCNB") are attributable to its wholly-owned subsidiary, LCNB National Bank (the "Bank").  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of LCNB and the Bank. 
    
  The unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations.  In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods, as required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01. 
    
  The consolidated condensed balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet as of that day. 
    
  Certain prior period data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 
    
  LCNB adopted ASU No. 2015-07, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):  Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)" during the first quarter of 2016.  ASU No. 2015-07 applies to entities that measure an investment's fair value using the net asset value per share, or an equivalent, as a practical expedient.  It eliminates the requirement to classify such investments within the fair value hierarchy.  The amendments are to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  LCNB measures the fair value of certain mutual fund investments using the net asset value per share practical expedient and disclosures concerning these investments in Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements have been changed to comply with the new guidance.  Adoption did not have an impact on LCNB's results of operations or financial position. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  .  These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accounting policies, and financial notes thereto included in LCNB's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 

Note 2   Acquisitions 
    
  On   December 29, 2014  , LCNB and BNB Bancorp, Inc. ( BNB ) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement ) pursuant to which BNB was acquired by LCNB on April 30, 2015.  Immediately following the merger of BNB into LCNB, Brookville National Bank ("Brookville"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNB, was merged into LCNB National Bank.  Brookville operated a main office and a branch office, both in Brookville, Ohio.  These offices became branches of the Bank after the merger. 
    
  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the shareholders of BNB common stock received, for each share of BNB common stock, (i) $  15.75   in cash and (ii)   2.005   LCNB common shares.

  Note 2   Acquisitions (continued) 

The merger with BNB was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration paid were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the merger date, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):   

The amount of goodwill recorded reflects LCNB's entrance into a new market and related synergies that are expected to result from the acquisition and represent the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired.  The goodwill will not be amortizable on LCNB's financial records, but is deductible for tax purposes.  The core deposit intangible is being amortized over   nine   years using the straight-line method. 
    
  Direct costs related to the acquisition were expensed as incurred and are recorded as a merger-related expense in the consolidated condensed statements of income.

Information concerning investment securities with gross unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, is as follows (dollars in thousands):

  Note 3 - Investment Securities (continued) 

Management has determined that the unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   are primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates and do not reflect credit quality deterioration of the securities.   Because LCNB does not have the intent to sell the investments and it is more likely than not that LCNB will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity, LCNB does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
  Contractual maturities of investment securities at   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands).  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities when issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations. 

Investment securities with a market value of   $195,448,000   and   $215,952,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes required as permitted by law. 
    
  Certain information concerning the sale of investment securities available-for-sale for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows (in thousands): 

Realized gains or losses from the sale of securities are computed using the specific identification method.

Note 4 - Loans 
    
  Major classifications of loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

All advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Cincinnati are secured by a blanket pledge of LCNB's 1-4 family first lien mortgage loans in the amount of approximately   $228 million   and   $231 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Additionally, LCNB is required to hold minimum levels of FHLB stock, based on the outstanding borrowings. 
    
  Loans acquired through mergers are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the acquired entity's previously established allowance for loan losses.  The excess of expected cash flows over the estimated fair value of acquired loans is recognized as interest income over the remaining contractual lives of the loans using the level yield method.  Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will require additions to the allowance for loan losses.  Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows result in the recognition of additional interest income over the then-remaining contractual lives of the loans. 
    
  Impaired loans acquired are accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 310-30.  Factors considered in evaluating whether an acquired loan was impaired include delinquency status and history, updated borrower credit status, collateral information, and updated loan-to-value information.  The difference between contractually required payments at the time of acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.  The interest component of the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining contractual life of the loan using the level yield method.   Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will require additions to the allowance for loan losses.  Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows will result in a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield.

The risk characteristics of LCNB's material loan portfolio segments are as follows: 
    
  Commercial and Industrial Loans.   LCNB s commercial and industrial loan portfolio consists of loans for various purposes, including loans to fund working capital requirements (such as inventory and receivables financing) and purchases of machinery and equipment.  LCNB offers a variety of commercial and industrial loan arrangements, including term loans, balloon loans, and lines of credit.  Most commercial and industrial loans have a variable rate, with adjustment periods ranging from   one month   to   five years  .  Adjustments are generally based on a publicly available index rate plus a margin.  The margin varies based on the terms and collateral securing the loan.  Commercial and industrial loans are offered to businesses and professionals for short and medium terms on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis. Commercial and industrial loans typically are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business.  Collateral, when obtained, may include liens on furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory, receivables, or other assets.  As a result, such loans involve complexities, variables, and risks that require thorough underwriting and more robust servicing than other types of loans. 
    
  Commercial, Secured by Real Estate Loans.    Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by a variety of commercial, retail, and office buildings, religious facilities, multifamily (more than two-family) residential properties, construction and land development loans, and other land loans. Commercial real estate loan products generally amortize over   five   to   twenty-five   years and are payable in monthly principal and interest installments.  Some have balloon payments due within   one   to   ten   years after the origination date.  Many have adjustable interest rates with adjustment periods ranging from   one   to   ten   years, some of which are subject to established  floor  interest rates. 
    
  Commercial real estate loans are underwritten based on the ability of the property, in the case of income producing property, or the borrower s business to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon global debt service, collateral value, financial strength of any guarantors, and other factors. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated with a   75%   maximum loan to appraised value ratio. 
    
  Residential Real Estate Loans.    Residential real estate loans include loans secured by first or second mortgage liens on one to two-family residential property.  Home equity lines of credit and mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied agricultural property are included in this category.  First and second mortgage loans are generally amortized over   five   to   thirty   years with monthly principal and interest payments.  Home equity lines of credit generally have a   five   year draw period with interest only payments followed by a repayment period with monthly payments based on the amount outstanding.  LCNB offers both fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans.  Adjustable rate loans are available with adjustment periods ranging between   one   to   ten   years and adjust according to an established index plus a margin, subject to certain floor and ceiling rates.  Home equity lines of credit have a variable rate based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. 
    
  LCNB does not originate reverse mortgage loans or residential real estate loans generally considered to be  subprime.  
    
  Residential real estate loans are underwritten primarily based on the borrower s ability to repay, prior credit history, and the value of the collateral.  LCNB generally requires private mortgage insurance for first mortgage loans that have a loan to appraised value ratio of greater than   80%  . 
  Consumer Loans.    LCNB s portfolio of consumer loans generally includes secured and unsecured loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures.  Secured loans include loans to fund the purchase of automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and similar acquisitions. Consumer loans made by LCNB generally have fixed rates and terms ranging up to   72   months, depending upon the nature of the collateral, size of the loan, and other relevant factors. 
    
  Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates, but pose additional risks of collectability and loss when compared to certain other types of loans. Collateral, if present, is generally subject to damage, wear, and depreciation.  The borrower s ability to repay is of primary importance in the underwriting of consumer loans. 
    
  Agricultural Loans.    LCNB s portfolio of agricultural loans includes loans for financing agricultural production or for financing the purchase of equipment used in the production of agricultural products.  LCNB s agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles, or other agricultural related collateral.

  Note 4   Loans (continued) 

LCNB uses a risk-rating system to quantify loan quality.  A loan is assigned to a risk category based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service the debt including, but not limited to, current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends.  The categories used are: 

Pass   loans categorized in this category are higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 
                
    Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM) - loans in this category are currently protected but are potentially weak. These loans constitute a risk but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard.  The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an undue risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. 
                
    Substandard   loans in this category are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the possibility that LCNB will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
                
    Doubtful   loans classified in this category have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Each restructured loan is separately negotiated with the borrower and includes terms and conditions that reflect the borrower's ability to pay the debt as modified.  Modifications may include interest only payments for a period of time, temporary or permanent reduction of the loan's interest rate, capitalization of delinquent interest, or extensions of the maturity date. 
    
  LCNB is not committed to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms were modified in a troubled debt restructuring. 
    
  There were   no   troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted within twelve months of the restructuring date for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and that remained in default at period end.

  LCNB is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit.  They involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets.  Exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to financial instruments for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contract amount of those instruments.

The Bounce Protection product, a customer deposit overdraft program, is offered as a service and does not constitute a contract between the customer and LCNB. 
    
  LCNB uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.   
    
  Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent off-balance-sheet credit risk at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Unused lines of credit include amounts not drawn on line of credit loans.  Commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. 
    
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  These guarantees generally are fully secured and have varying maturities.   
    
  LCNB evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower.  Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, residential realty, income-producing commercial property, and property, plant, and equipment. 
    
  Capital expenditures include the construction or acquisition of new office buildings, improvements to LCNB's offices, purchases of furniture and equipment, and additions or improvements to LCNB's information technology system.  Commitments outstanding for capital expenditures as of   September 30, 2016   totaled approximately   $7,390,000  , which includes estimated remaining costs for construction of a new Operations Center in Lebanon, Ohio.  
    
  Management believes that LCNB has sufficient liquidity to fund its lending and capital expenditure commitments. 
    
  LCNB and its subsidiaries are parties to various claims and proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  Management, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings and claims will not be material to the consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 13 - Stock Based Compensation 
    
  LCNB established an Ownership Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan") during 2002 that allowed for stock-based awards to eligible employees, as determined by the Board of Directors.  The awards were made in the form of stock options, share awards, and/or appreciation rights.  The 2002 Plan provided for the issuance of up to   200,000   shares.  The 2002 Plan expired on April 16, 2012.  Any outstanding unexercised options, however, continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms. 
    
  The 2015 Ownership Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") was ratified by LCNB's shareholders at the annual meeting on April 28, 2015 and allows for stock-based awards to eligible employees, as determined by the Compensation Committee of  the Board of Directors.  Awards may be made in the form of stock options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, and/or restricted share units.  The 2015 Plan provides for the issuance of up to   450,000   shares.  The 2015 Plan will terminate on April 28, 2025 and is subject to earlier termination by the Compensation Committee.   
    
  Stock-based awards may be in the form of treasury shares or new shares.

LCNB has not granted stock option awards since 2012.  Options granted to date under the 2002 Plan vest ratably over a   five  -year period and expire   ten   years after the date of grant.  Stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the periods indicated: 

The aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option) for options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   that were "in the money" (market price greater than exercise price) was   $149,000  .  The aggregate intrinsic value at that date for only the options that were exercisable was   $140,000  .  The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding at   September 30, 2015   that were in the money was   $348,000   and the aggregate intrinsic value at that date for only the options that were exercisable was   $313,000  .  The intrinsic value changes based upon fluctuations in the market value of LCNB's common stock. 
    
  Total expense related to options included in salaries and employee benefits for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2,000   and   $4,000  , respectively.  The related tax benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0   and   $1,000  , respectively.  Total expense related to options included in salaries and employee benefits for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $3,000   and   $13,000  , respectively.

Note 14 - Earnings per Common Share 
    
  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share is adjusted for the dilutive effects of stock options, warrants, and restricted stock.  The diluted average number of common shares outstanding has been increased for the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants with proceeds used to purchase treasury shares at the average market price for the period.  The computations are as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data): 

Options to purchase   2,516   and   12,962   shares of common stock at a weighted average price of   $17.88   and   $18.41   per share were outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the exercise prices of the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares.

Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements 
    
  LCNB measures certain assets at fair value using various valuation techniques and assumptions, depending on the nature of the asset.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
    
  The inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are assigned to one of three broad levels: 
             
    Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the reporting date. 
                
    Level 2   inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets,  quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices (such as interest rates or yield curves) that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. 
     The majority of LCNB's financial debt securities are classified as available-for-sale.  The securities are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  LCNB utilizes a pricing service for determining the fair values of most of its investment securities.  Fair value for U.S. Treasury notes are determined based on market quotations (level 1).  Fair value for most of the other investment securities is calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each security.  The discount rates for these cash flows are estimated by the pricing service using rates observed in the market (level 2).  Cash flow streams are dependent on estimated prepayment speeds and the overall structure of the securities given existing market conditions.  In addition, LCNB has invested in trust preferred securities, equity securities, and   three   mutual funds that are not priced by the pricing service.  Market quotations (level 1) are used to determine fair values for the trust preferred securities, equity securities, and a publicly traded mutual fund.  Investments in   two   mutual funds that are measured at fair value using net asset values ("NAV") per share as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy.    These funds can be redeemed at any time at their current NAVs.  An investment in a mutual fund that is not traded in an active market is considered to have level 2 inputs because an investor can have its interest in the fund redeemed for the balance of its capital account at any quarter-end assuming the fund is given a   60   day notice.  The investment in this fund is carried at fair value, which approximates cost.  
    
  Assets that may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include impaired loans, other real estate owned, and other repossessed assets.  A loan is considered impaired when management believes it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Impaired loans are carried at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, if this value is less than the loan balance.  The inputs are considered to be level 3. 
    
  Other real estate owned is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loan to foreclosed assets, usually based on an appraisal of the property.  Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value.  These inputs are also considered to be level 3.

  Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements (continued) 

The fair values of off-balance-sheet financial instruments such as loan commitments and letters of credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements. The fair values of such instruments were not material at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Fair values of financial instruments are based on various assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Therefore, the fair values presented may not represent amounts that could be realized in actual transactions.  In addition, because the required disclosures exclude certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments, any aggregation of the fair value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value of LCNB.  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents 
  The carrying amounts presented are deemed to approximate fair value. 
    
  Investment securities, held-to-maturity 
  Fair values for investment securities, held-to-maturity are based on quoted market prices for similar securities and/or discounted cash flow analysis or other methods.   
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock 
  The carrying value of Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock approximates fair value based on the respective redemptive provisions. 
    
  Loans 
  Fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, incorporating assumptions of current and projected prepayment speeds.  These current rates approximate market rates. 
    
  Deposits 
  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.  The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities, which approximates market rates. 
    
  Borrowings 
  The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and U.S. Treasury demand note borrowings are deemed to approximate fair value of short-term borrowings.  For long-term debt, fair values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows using current interest rates. 
    
  Accrued interest receivable and Accrued interest payable 
  Carrying amount approximates fair value.

  Note 16   Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued) 

ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" 
  ASU No. 2014-09 was issued in May 2014 and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance for contracts to transfer goods or services or other nonfinancial assets.  Lease contracts, insurance contracts, and most financial instruments are not included in the scope of this update.  ASU No. 2014-09 provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance enumerates five steps that entities should follow in achieving this core principle.  Additional disclosures providing information about contracts with customers are required.   
    
  Guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 has been clarified by the following ASUs: 
             
    ASU No. 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)" 
                
    ASU No. 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" 
                
    ASU No. 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients" 
       
  As extended by   ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,"   ASU No. 2014-09 and the clarifying ASUs are effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Transitional guidance is included in the updates.  Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  Since LCNB's products are substantially financial in nature, adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and the clarifying ASUs are not expected to have a material impact on LCNB's results of operations or financial position. 
    
  ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" 
  ASU No. 2014-15 was issued in August 2014 and requires management to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether it is probable that the entity will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that financial statements are issued (or are available to be issued, where applicable).  Certain disclosures, as described in the update, are required if management identifies substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU No. 2014-15 will take effect in the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early application is permitted.

  ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" 
  ASU No. 2016-01 was issued in January 2016 and applies to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities.  It makes targeted changes to generally accepted accounting principles for public companies as follows: 
           1. 
    Requires most equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 
              2. 
    Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.  When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 
              3. 
    Eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 
              4. 
    Requires use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 
              5. 
    Requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 
              6. 
    Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 
              7. 
    Clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.

For public business entities, the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on LCNB's results of operations or financial position.  
    
  ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" 
  ASU No. 2016-02 was issued in February 2016 and requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments ("the lease liability") and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.  When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, the lessee should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain, as defined, to exercise an option to the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease.  Optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included if the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise the purchase option.  Most variable lease payments should be excluded except for those that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments. 
    
  A lessee shall classify a lease as a finance lease if it meets any of five listed criteria: 
           1. 
    The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term. 
              2. 
    The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. 
              3. 
    The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset.  
              4. 
    The present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. 
              5. 
    The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. 
       
  For finance leases, a lessee shall recognize in the statement of comprehensive income interest on the lease liability separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset.  Amortization of the right-of-use asset shall be on a straight-line basis, unless another basis is more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the right-of-use asset s future economic benefits.  If the lease does not meet any of the five criteria, the lessee shall classify it as an operating lease and shall recognize a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
    
  The amendments in this update are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, as defined, and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early application is permitted.  LCNB management is currently evaluating the financial statement impact of adopting the new guidance. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-05, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)" 
  ASU No. 2016-05 was issued in March 2016 and applies to reporting entities for which there is a change in a counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated a hedging instrument under Topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging."  The amendments in this update clarify that a change in a counterparty to such a derivative instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria under applicable guidance continue to be met.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-05 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  LCNB does not currently have any investments in derivative instruments that have  been designated as hedging instruments and adoption of ASU No. 2016-05 is not expected to have an impact on LCNB's results of operations or financial position.

ASU No. 2016-06 , "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)" 
  ASU No. 2016-06 was issued in March 2016 and clarifies what steps are required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative.  An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this update is required to assess the 
  embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence.  The four-step decision sequence requires an entity to consider whether (1) the payoff is adjusted based on changes in an index, (2) the payoff is indexed to an underlying other than interest rates or credit risk, (3) the debt involves a substantial premium or discount, and (4) the call (put) option is contingently exercisable.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-06 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  LCNB does not currently have any investments in debt instruments containing such call (put) options and adoption of ASU No. 2016-06 is not expected to have an impact on LCNB's results of operations or financial position. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" 
  ASU No. 2016-09 was issued in March 2016 and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.  The new guidance involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax 
  consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  Under ASU No. 2016-09, any excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  Excess tax benefits are to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.  In accruing compensation cost, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, as required under current guidance, or account for forfeitures when they occur.  For an award to qualify for equity classification, an entity cannot partially settle the award in excess of the employer's maximum statutory withholding requirements.  Such cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  Adoption of ASU No. 2016-07 is not expected to have a material impact on LCNB's results of operations or financial position. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" 
  ASU No. 2016-13 was issued in June 2016 and, once effective, will significantly change current guidance for recognizing impairment of financial instruments.  Current guidance requires an "incurred loss" methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred.  ASU No. 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects expected credit losses over the lives of the loans and requires consideration of a broader range of information to inform credit loss estimates.  The ASU requires an organization to estimate all expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Additional disclosures are required. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-13 also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  Under the new guidance, entities will determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available-for-sale debt security is a credit loss.  Any credit loss will be recognized as an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as is currently required.  As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as currently required. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-13 eliminates the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Instead,  purchased financial assets with credit deterioration will be recorded gross of  estimated credit losses as of the date of acquisition and the estimated credit losses amounts will be added to the allowance for credit losses.  Thereafter, entities will account for additional impairment of such purchased assets using the models listed above.

  ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Paymnents" 
  ASU No. 2016-15 was issued in August 2016 and applies to all entities required to present a statement of cash flows in their financial reports.  The guidance in this ASU addresses eight cash flow classification issues that have been creating diversity in practice.  One of the issues is the classification of  cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, which are to be classified as cash outflows from financing activities under the new guidance.  LCNB incurred a prepayment penalty during January 2016 upon the early payment in full of a FHLB advance and classified such penalty as a cash outflow from operating activities in its consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.   Management early adopted ASU No. 2016-15 during the third quarter 2016 and reclassified the penalty as a cash outflow from financing activities.

  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses  .  The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.  The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio, based on evaluations of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience.  The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay.  This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.

  LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  Item 2.          Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The allowance consists of specific and general components.  The specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful, substandard, or special mention.  For such loans an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value is lower than the carrying value of that loan.  The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors, which include trends in underperforming loans, trends in the volume and terms of loans, economic trends and conditions, concentrations of credit, trends in the quality of loans, and borrower financial statement exceptions. 
    
  Based on its evaluations, management believes that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. 
    
  Acquired Credit Impaired Loans.    LCNB   accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.  Acquired loans are reviewed to determine if there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that LCNB will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements.  The analysis includes expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield).  LCNB records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value.  Thus, an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date.  Subsequent to the date of acquisition, expected future cash flows on loans acquired are updated and any losses or reductions in estimated cash flows which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses. An increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan.  Due to the number, size, and complexity of loans within the acquired loan portfolio, there is always a possibility of inherent undetected losses. 
    
  Accounting for Intangibles.    LCNB s intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   are composed primarily of goodwill and core deposit intangibles related to acquisitions of other financial institutions.  It also includes mortgage servicing rights recorded from sales of mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and mortgage servicing rights acquired through the acquisition of Eaton National Bank   Trust Co.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is reviewed annually for impairment.  Core deposit intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated weighted average lives.  Mortgage servicing rights are capitalized by allocating the total cost of loans between mortgage servicing rights and the loans based on their estimated fair values.  Capitalized mortgage servicing rights are amortized to loan servicing income in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income, subject to periodic review for impairment. 
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  Net income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was $2,896,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.29) and $8,828,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.89 and $0.88), respectively.  This compares to net income of $2,633,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.26) and $8,590,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.89 and $0.88, respectively) for the same three- and nine-month periods in 2015.  Results for the first nine months of 2016 were significantly affected by the acquisition of BNB Bancorp, Inc. ("BNB") on April 30, 2015.  In addition, LCNB sold impaired loans with a carrying value of approximately $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2015, resulting in a net gain from sale of loans of $181,000. 
    
  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included several one-time charges.  The first of which was a $251,000 penalty incurred during the first quarter for the early payoff of a now high-rate Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") borrowing, which will decrease future interest expense. The second was write-downs totaling $576,000 recognized during the second and third quarters for a commercial other real estate owned property. 
    
  Organic loan growth during the nine-month period in 2016 was $40.7 million, which significantly contributed to increases in 
  net interest income of $513,000 and $482,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as 
  compared to the same periods in 2015.

The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $132,000 greater than the comparable period 
  in 2015. The provision for the nine-month period of 2016 was $128,000 less than the comparable period in 2015. Net loan 
  charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $189,000 and $1,149,000, respectively. The 
  2015 balance includes charge-offs recognized as a result of the impaired loan sale mentioned above.  
    
  Non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest increased $2,357,000, from $2,282,000 or 0.30% of total loans at December 31, 2015, to $4,639,000 or 0.57% of total loans at September 30, 2016, primarily due to two loans to the same borrower totaling $1,307,000 that were newly classified as non-accrual during the first quarter 2016 and two loans to the same borrower totaling $1,217,000 that were newly classified as non-accrual during the third quarter 2016. These four loans were classified as impaired at September 30, 2016 and reviewed to determine if specific allowance for loan loss allocations were needed. 
    
  Loans with a credit quality indicator of substandard increased $16,848,000, from $17,297,000 at December 31, 2015 to $34,145,000 at September 30, 2016.  Commercial, secured by real estate loans classified as substandard at September 30, 2016 included seven loans totaling $12,276,000 that were not classified as substandard at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Other real estate owned (which includes property acquired through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure) decreased from $846,000 at December 31, 2015 to $270,000 at September 30, 2016 due to write-downs totaling $576,000 recognized on commercial property. 
    
  Non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $460,000 and $715,000 greater 
  than the comparable periods in 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in gains from sales of investment securities, reflecting a higher volume of securities sales. 
    
  Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $505,000 and $1,190,000 greater than the comparable periods in 2015, respectively. The increase for the quarter was largely due to increases in salaries and employee 
  benefits. The increase for the nine-month period was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, increases in 
  other real estate owned expenses, and a $251,000 penalty for the early payoff of a $5 million FHLB advance recognized during the first quarter 2016. The FHLB advance had an interest rate of 5.25% and was paid off to reduce interest expense on long-term debt. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to salary and wage increases, employees retained from the BNB acquisition, and an increase in the number of employees in addition to the acquisition. Other real estate owned expenses increased primarily due to the $576,000 of write-downs recognized during the second and third quarters of 2016 as discussed previously.  These increases were partially offset by the absence of merger-related expenses during the 2016 period.

Net Interest Income 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   2015 
  LCNB's primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between earnings from loans and other investments and interest paid on deposits and other liabilities.  The following table presents, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , average balances for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the income or expense related to each item, and the resulting average yields earned or rates paid. 

(1)  Includes non-accrual loans, if any. 
  (2)  Income from tax-exempt securities is included in interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.  Interest income has 
                been divided by a factor comprised of the complement of the incremental tax rate of 34.2% for 2016 and 34.0% for   
                2015. 
  (3)  The net interest spread is the difference between the average rate on total interest-earning assets and interest-bearing 
                 liabilities. 
  (4)  The net interest margin is the taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent basis interest income and expense for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Changes not solely attributable to rate or volume have been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each. 

Net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $10,433,000, an increase of $559,000 over the comparable period in   2015  .  Total interest income increased $532,000 and total interest expense decreased $27,000. 
    
  The increase in total interest income was due primarily to a $51.5 million increase in average total earning assets.  Average loans increased $40.6 million and average non-taxable investment securities increased $24.2 million, partially offset by a $13.2 million decrease in taxable investment securities.  Slightly offsetting this net increase was a 5 basis point (a basis point equals 0.01%) decrease in the average rate earned on loans and a 25 basis point decrease in the average rate earned on non-taxable investment securities, partially offset by an 18 basis point increase in the average rate earned on taxable investment securities.    
    
  The decrease in total interest expense was due primarily to a $5.4 million decrease in average long-term debt and a 189 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on average long-term debt.  Both decreases were due to the early payment in full during January 2016 of a $5.0 million FHLB advance bearing an interest rate of 5.25%. The advance was paid off to reduce future interest expense.  These decreases were partially offset by increases in the average rates paid on savings deposits and IRA and time certificates.

  The following table presents, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , average balances for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the income or expense related to each item, and the resulting average yields earned or rates paid. 

(1)  Includes non-accrual loans, if any. 
  (2)  Income from tax-exempt securities is included in interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.  Interest income has 
                been divided by a factor comprised of the complement of the incremental tax of 34.2% for 2016 and 34.0% for   
                2015. 
  (3)  The net interest spread is the difference between the average rate on total interest-earning assets and interest-bearing 
                 liabilities. 
  (4)  The net interest margin is the taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

  Item 2.          Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent basis interest income and expense for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Changes not solely attributable to rate or volume have been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each. 

Net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $31,136,000, an increase of $636,000 over the comparable period in   2015  .  Total interest income increased $831,000, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense of $195,000. 
    
  The increase in total interest income was due primarily to a $93.2 million increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 22 basis point decrease in the average rate earned on earning assets.  Included in the average rate for 2015 was non-accrual interest recognized as a result of the impaired loan sale.  The increase in average total earning assets was due to a $53.2 million increase in average loans and to a $40.4 million increase in average total investment securities.  The increase in average loans was partially due to the acquisition of BNB and partially due to organic loan growth.  
    
  The increase in total interest expense was primarily due to an 18 basis point increase in the average rate paid on IRA and time certificates, partially offset by a combination of a 147 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on long-term debt and a $5.4 million decrease in average long-term debt.  Average long-term debt and the rate associated with that debt decreased due to the payment in full during January 2016 of a $5.0 million advance from the FHLB of Cincinnati that had an interest rate of 5.25%.

Provision and Allowance For Loan Losses 
  The total provision for loan losses is determined based upon management's evaluation as to the amount needed to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate in relation to the risk of losses inherent in the portfolio.  In addition to historic charge-off percentages, factors taken into consideration to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the nature, volume, and consistency of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, a review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect borrowers' ability to pay.  The provision for loan losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were $372,000 and $858,000, respectively, as compared to $240,000 and $986,000 for the same periods in   2015  .  Net recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $53,000 and net charge-offs for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was $189,000.  This compares to net charge-offs of $161,000 and $1,149,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015  , respectively.  Net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses had elevated balances during the nine-month period in 2015 due to the sale of impaired loans during the second quarter of that year. 
    
  Non-Interest Income 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016     vs.     2015    
  Total non-interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $460,000 greater than for the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to  $307,000 in net gains from sales of securities (no securities were sold during the third quarter of 2015) and to a $117,000 increase in trust income reflecting an increase in the volume of brokerage sales during the third quarter of 2016.   
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016     vs.     2015    
  Total non-interest income for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $715,000 greater than for the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to a $625,000 increase in net gains from sales of securities, partially offset by a $113,000 decrease in gains from sales of loans.  Net gains from sales of securities increased due to a greater volume of sales during 2016.  The decrease in gains from sales of loans reflects the absence during 2016 of net gains totaling $181,000 recognized on impaired loans sold during the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  Non-Interest Expense 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   2015 
  Non-interest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $505,000 greater than for the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to a $302,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $237,000 increase in other non-interest expense.  Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to salary and wage increases and an increase in the number of employees.  The increase in other non-interest expense includes a $98,000 increase in fraudulent check and checkcard losses, and a $110,000 increase in fees paid for contracted services. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   2015 
  Non-interest expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $1,190,000 greater than for the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to a $726,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $364,000 increase in other real estate owned expense, and a $759,000 increase in other non-interest expense.  Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to salary and wage increases, employees retained from the BNB acquisition, and an increase in the number of employees outside of the acquisition.  The increase in other real estate owned expense was primarily due to writedowns during 2016 totaling $576,000 on a commercial other real estate owned property.  The increase in other non-interest expense included a $251,000 penalty incurred on the early payoff during the first quarter of 2016 of the FHLB advance mentioned earlier, a $161,000 increase in fraudulent check and checkcard losses, and a $122,000 increase in fees paid for contracted services. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  LCNB's effective tax rates for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were 26.0% and 27.2%, respectively.  The difference between the statutory rate of 34.0% and the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax-exempt interest income from municipal securities and tax-exempt earnings from bank owned life insurance.  
    
  Financial Condition 
  Interest-bearing demand deposits, a component of total cash and cash equivalents in the asset section of the balance sheet, was $15.3 million greater at September 30, 2016 than at December 31, 2015 because of a $38.3 million increase in public fund deposits.  Public fund deposits can be relatively volatile due to seasonal tax collections and the financial needs of the local entities.  Historically, public fund deposits tend to be at their lowest balances at year-ends.  Not including public fund deposits, the remaining increase was predominately in short-term noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits products.   
  Available-for-sale investment securities at   September 30, 2016   were $31.6 million less than at   December 31, 2015   and held-to-maturity investment securities were $19.4 million greater at September 30, 2016 than at December 31, 2015.  Investment securities in the held-to-maturity category increased due to municipal securities purchased from various governmental entities within LCNB's marketing area.  Investment securities in the available-for-sale category decreased because a portion of the cash received from sales, maturities, and calls was used to fund loan growth and the purchase of the local held-to-maturity municipal securities. 
    
  Net loans at   September 30, 2016   were $40.1 million greater than at   December 31, 2015  .  Commercial real estate loans increased by $47.9 million and agricultural loans increased by $2.4 million, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in residential real estate loans and a $5.2 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans.   
    
  Net premises and equipment at   September 30, 2016   was $4.2 million greater than at   December 31, 2015   primarily due to land and construction costs paid during the first nine months of 2016 for the new Operations Center. 
    
  Bank owned life insurance at   September 30, 2016   was $4.6 million greater than at   December 31, 2015   primarily due to the purchase of $4.0 million of new policies during the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   were $71.8 million greater than at   December 31, 2015  .  Included in this increase was a $38.3 million increase in public fund deposits by local government entities.   
    
  The increase in public fund deposits contributed to the $15.3 million increase in interest-bearing demand deposits, a component of total cash and cash equivalents in the asset section of the balance sheet, between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 and the $20.4 million decrease in short-term borrowings between the same two dates. 
    
  Long-term debt at   September 30, 2016    was $5.3 million less than at December 31, 2015 primarily due to the early payment in full of a $5.0 million advance from the FHLB during January 2016.  The advance had an interest rate of 5.25% and its payment will reduce future interest expense. 
    
  Shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016   was $6.8 million greater than at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to earnings retained and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, resulting from market driven increases in the market value of investments securities.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $1.3 million decrease in common shares primarily resulting from the repurchase and cancellation of all outstanding warrants. 
    
  Regulatory Capital 
  The Bank and LCNB are required by regulators to meet certain minimum levels of capital adequacy. These are expressed in the form of certain ratios. Capital is separated into Tier 1 capital (essentially shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangibles) and Tier 2 capital (essentially the allowance for loan losses limited to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets).  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is the sum of common stock, related surplus, and retained earnings net of treasury stock, accumulated other comprehensive income, and other adjustments.  These three ratios, which are based on the degree of credit risk in LCNB's assets, provide for weighting assets based on assigned risk factors and include off-balance sheet items such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit.  The leverage ratio supplements the risk-based capital guidelines. 
  For various regulatory purposes, financial institutions are classified into categories based upon capital adequacy:

  Item 2.          Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

A new rule requiring a Capital Conservation Buffer began phase-in on January 1, 2016.  Under the fully-implemented rule, a financial institution will need to maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of at least 2.5% above its minimum risk-weighted capital requirements to avoid limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments to shareholders and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  A financial institution with a buffer below 2.5% will be subject to increasingly stringent limitations on capital distributions as the buffer approaches zero. 
    
  As of the most recent notification from their regulators, the Bank and LCNB were categorized as "well-capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since the last notification that would change the Bank's or LCNB's category. 
    
  A summary of the regulatory capital and capital ratios of LCNB follows (dollars in thousands): 

Liquidity 
  LCNB depends on dividends from the Bank for the majority of its liquid assets, including the cash needed to pay dividends to its shareholders.  National banking law limits the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to the sum of retained net income for the current year plus retained net income for the previous two years.  Prior approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Bank's primary regulator, is necessary for the Bank to pay dividends in excess of this amount.  In addition, dividend payments may not reduce capital levels below minimum regulatory guidelines.  Management believes the Bank will be able to pay anticipated dividends to LCNB Corp. without needing to request approval.  The Bank is not aware of any reasons why it would not receive such approval. 
    
  Liquidity is the ability to have funds available at all times to meet the commitments of LCNB.  Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale.  At   September 30, 2016  , LCNB's liquid assets amounted to $379.6 million or 28.5% of total assets.  This compares to liquid assets totaling $393.0 million, or 30.7% of total assets, at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Liquidity is also provided by access to core funding sources, primarily core depositors in LCNB's market area.  Approximately 81.5% of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   were "core" deposits, compared to 84.3% of deposits at   December 31, 2015  . Core deposits, for this purpose, are defined as total deposits less public funds and certificates of deposit greater than $100,000. The percentage of core deposits to total deposits decreased because of the growth in public fund deposits discussed above in relation to total growth in deposits.

  Item 2.          Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Secondary sources of liquidity include LCNB's ability to sell loan participations, borrow funds from the FHLB, purchase federal funds, issue repurchase agreements, or use a line of credit established with another bank. 
    
  Management closely monitors the level of liquid assets available to meet ongoing funding needs.  It is management's intent to maintain adequate liquidity so that sufficient funds are readily available at a reasonable cost.  LCNB experienced no liquidity or operational problems as a result of the current liquidity levels.

                 Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 

Market risk for LCNB is primarily interest rate risk.  LCNB attempts to mitigate this risk through asset/liability management strategies designed to decrease the vulnerability of its earnings to material and prolonged changes in interest rates.  LCNB does not use derivatives such as interest rate swaps, caps, or floors to hedge this risk.  LCNB has not entered into any market risk instruments for trading purposes. 
    
  The Bank's Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO") primarily uses a combination of Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis ("IRSA") and Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") analysis for measuring and managing interest rate risk.  IRSA is used to estimate the effect on net interest income ("NII") during a one-year period of instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates, also called interest rate shocks, of 100, 200, and 300 basis points.  Management considers the results of any significant downward scenarios to not be meaningful in the current interest rate environment.  The base projection uses a current interest rate scenario.  As shown below, the   September 30, 2016   IRSA indicates that an increase in interest rates will have a positive effect on net interest income ("NII").  The changes in NII for all rate assumptions are within LCNB's acceptable ranges. 

IRSA shows the effect on NII during a one-year period only.  A more long-range model is the EVE analysis, which shows the estimated present value of future cash inflows from interest-earning assets less the present value of future cash outflows for interest-bearing liabilities for the same rate shocks.  As shown below, the   September 30, 2016   EVE analysis indicates that an increase in interest rates will have a negative effect on the EVE.  The changes in EVE for all rate assumptions are within LCNB's acceptable ranges. 

The IRSA and EVE simulations discussed above are not projections of future income or equity and should not be relied on as being indicative of future operating results.  Assumptions used, including the nature and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows, are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely measure future net interest income or equity.  Furthermore, the models do not reflect actions that borrowers, depositors, and management may take in response to changing economic conditions and interest rate levels.

    Controls and Procedures 

a)    Disclosure controls and procedures.    The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of LCNB's disclosure controls and procedures that ensure that information relating to LCNB required to be disclosed by LCNB in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to LCNB's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, in order to allow timely decisions to be made regarding required disclosures.  Based upon this evaluation, these officers have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , LCNB's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  b)    Changes in internal control over financial reporting.    During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in LCNB's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, LCNB's internal control over financial reporting.
