Note 1     Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Aqua America, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) at   September   30  , 2016  ,   the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income   for the three   and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   the consolidated statements of cash flow   for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and the consolidated statement of equity for the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016   are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring accruals, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, the consolidated changes in equity, the consolidated results of operations, and the consolidated cash flow for the periods presented.  Because they cover interim periods, the statements and related notes to the financial statements do not include all disclosures and notes normally provided in annual financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  The   December 31, 2015   consolidated balance sheet data presented herein was derived from the Company s   December 31, 2015   audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures and notes normally provided in annual financial statements.        Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation   of debt issuance costs (see Note 15 -   Recent Accounting Pronouncements  )  .              

Note 2     Goodwill    

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company s goodwill, by business segment: 

The reclassification   of     goodwill to utility plant acquisition adjustment results from a mechanism approved by the applicable utility commission.  The mechanism provides for the transfer over time, and the recovery through customer rates, of goodwill associated with   some     acquisitions upon achieving   specific     objectives.  

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually, or more often, if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist, to determine whether it s more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  When testing goodwill for impairment, we may assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and entity specific events.  Alternatively, we may bypass this qualitative assessment for some of our reporting units and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by determining the fair value of a reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis.    The Company

tested the goodwill attributable for each of our reporting units for impairment as of July 31, 2016, in conjunction with the timing of our annual strategic business plan, and concluded that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, which has goodwill recorded, exceeded the reporting unit s carrying amount, indicating that none of the Company s goodwill was impaired.  

Note 3     Acquisitions    

Pursuant to our strategy to grow through acquisitions, i  n January 2016, the Company acquired Superior Water Company, Inc., which provides public water service to approximately   3,900   customers in portions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery counties   in   Pennsylvania.  The total purchase price for the utility system was   $16,750  , which consisted of the issuance of   439,943   shares of the Company s common stock and   $3,905   in cash.    The purchase price allocation for this acquisition   consisted   primarily of acquired property, plant and equipment   of   $25,167  ,   contributions in aid of construction of   $16,565  ,   and goodwill of   $  8,622  .        Additionally, during 2016, the Company completed   nine   acquisitions of water and wastewater utility systems in various states.  The total purchase price of these utility systems consisted of   $  1,721   in cash  , and there was no goodwill recorded  .    In 201  6, the   Company recorded goodwill of   $1,473   for an acquisition   that was   completed in   a prior period  .    The pro   forma effect of the business  es   acquired is not material either individually or collect  ively   to the Company s results of operations.           

I  n   April 2015,   the Company acquired the water and wastewater utility system assets of North Main  e     Utilities located in the Village of Glenview, Illinois serving approximately   7,400   customers.  The total purchase price consisted of   $  23,079   in cash  .    The purchase price allocation for this acquisition   consist  ed     primarily of acquired property, plant and equipment.    Additionally, in 2015, the Company completed   14   acquisitions of water and wastewater utility systems in various states.  The total purchase price of these utility systems consisted of   $5,210   in cash.                    

Note 4        Assets Held for Sale 

In December 2015, the Company decided   to sell a   business unit   which provides liquid waste hauling and disposal services.  This business unit was reported   within the Company s market-based subsidiary, Aqua Resources,   and   was   reported as assets held for sale in the Company s   December 31, 2015   consolidated balance sheet included in this report  .        During the second quarter of 2016, this business unit was sold for   $3,400   in cash and resulted in a gain on sale of   $537  .  The gain on sale is reported as a reduction to operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statements of net income.    This business unit   was   included in  Other  in the Company s segment information.       

I  n the second quarter of 2016, the Company decided to   market for sale business units   which install and test devices that prevent the contamination of potable water and repair water and wastewater systems.          Further, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company decided to   market for sale   a business unit which inspects, cleans and repairs storm and sanitary wastewater lines.    These business units are reported within the Company s market-based subsidiary, Aqua Resources.    These business units are reported as assets held for sale in the Company s   consolidated balance sheets included in this report  , and   are included in  Other  in the Company s segment information.

Note 5     Capitalization    

In February 2016, the Company amended its unsecured revolving credit facility to extend the expiration from   March 2017   to   February 2021  , to increase the facility from   $200,000   to   $250,000  , and   to add   a fourth bank to the lending group.    Funds borrowed under this facility are classified as long-term debt and are used to provide working capital as well as support for letters of credit for insurance policies and other financing arrangements.  Interest under this facility is based at the Company s option, on the prime rate, an adjusted Euro-Rate, an adjusted federal funds rate or at rates offered by the banks.  A facility fee is charged on the total commitment amount of the agreement.   

Note 6     Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The Company follows the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which defines fair value and establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.  That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair   value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level 1:  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;        

Level 2:  inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or        

Level 3:  inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.        

The asset s or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There have been no changes in the valuation techniques used to measure fair value or asset or liability transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  

Financial instruments are recorded at carrying value in the financial statements and approximate fair value as of the dates presented.  The fair value of these instruments is disclosed below in accordance with current accounting guidance related to financial instruments.  

The fair value of loans payable   is     determined based on   its     carrying amount and utilizing Level 1 methods and assumptions.        As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the Company s loans payable was   $47,990   and $  16,721  , respectively, which equates to their estimated fair value.  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, which is comprised of a money market fund, is determined based on the net asset value per unit utilizing Level 2 methods and assumptions.  As of

(In thousands of dollars, except per share amounts) 

(UNAUDITED) 

September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents was   $3,712   and $  3,229  , respectively, which equates to their fair value.    

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s long-term debt is as follows: 

The fair value of long-term debt has been determined by discounting the future cash flows using current market interest rates for similar financial instruments of the same duration utilizing Level 2 methods and assumptions.  The Company s customers  advances for construction have a carrying   value   of   $93,023     as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $86,934   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Their relative fair values cannot be accurately estimated because future refund payments depend on several variables, including new customer connections, customer consumption levels, and future rate increases.  Portions of these non-interest bearing instruments are payable annually through   2026     and amounts not paid by the respective contract expiration dates become non-refundable.  The fair value of these amounts would, however, be less than their carrying value due to the non-interest bearing feature. 

Note 7     Net Income per Common Share    

Basic net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares.  The dilutive effect of employee stock-based compensation is included in the computation of diluted net income per common share.  The dilutive effect of stock-based compensation is calculated using the treasury stock method and expected proceeds upon exercise or issuance of the stock-based compensation.    The treasury stock method assumes that the proceeds from   stock-based compensation   are used to purchase the Company s common stock at the average market price during the period.    The following table summarizes the shares, in thousands, used in computing basic and diluted net income per common share:    

For the three   and   nine     months ended   September   30  ,    2016   and   2015  , all of the Company s employee stock options were included in the calculations of diluted net income per share as the calculated cost to exercise

the stock options was less than the average market price of the Company s common stock during these periods.    

Note 8     Stock-based Compensation    

Under the Company s 2009 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan  , as amended as of February 27, 2014   (the  2009 Plan ), as approved by the Company s shareholders to replace the 2004 Equity Compensation Plan (the  2004 Plan ), stock options, stock units, stock awards, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, and other stock-based awards may be granted to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants and advisors.  The 2009 Plan authorizes   6,250,000   shares for issuance under the plan.  A maximum of   3,125,000   shares under the 2009 Plan may be issued pursuant to stock awards, stock units and other stock-based awards  , subject to adjustment as provided in the 2009 Plan  .    During any calendar year, no individual may be granted (i) stock options and stock appreciation rights under the 2009 Plan for more than   500,000   shares of Company stock in the aggregate or (ii) stock awards, stock units or other stock-based awards under the 2009 Plan for more than 500,000 shares of Company stock in the aggregate, subject to adjustment as provided in the 2009 Plan.    Awards   to employees and consultants   under the 2009 Plan are made by a committee of the Board of Directors   of the Company,   except that with respect to awards to the Chief Executive Officer, the committee recommends those awards for approval by the non-employee directors of the Board of Directors.  In   the case of awards to non-employee directors, the Board of Directors   makes such awards  .  At   September   30  , 2016  ,    3,982,401   shares were still available for   issuance     under the 2009 Plan.        No   further grants may be made under the 2004 Plan.        

Performance Share Units       A performance share unit ( PSU ) represents the right to receive a share of the Company s common stock if specified performance goals are met over the   three  -  year performance period specified in the grant, subject to exceptions through the respective vesting period, generally   three   years.  Each grantee is granted a target award of PSUs, and may earn between   0  % and   200  % of the target amount depending on the Company s performance against the performance goals.  The following table provides compensation costs for stock-based compensation related to   PSUs  :

(UNAUDITED) 

The following table summarizes   the     PSU transactions for the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016  :      

A portion of the fair value of PSUs was estimated at the grant date based on the probability of satisfying the market-based conditions using the Monte Carlo valuation method  , which assesses probabilities of various outcomes of market conditions  .  The other portion of the fair value of the PSUs is based on the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date, regardless of whether the market-based condition is satisfied.  The per unit weighted-average fair value at the date of grant for PSUs granted during the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 201  6   and 2015   was   $  28.89   and $  26.45  , respectively.  The fair value of each PSU grant is amortized monthly into compensation expense on a straight-line basis over their respective vesting periods, generally   36   months.  The accrual of compensation costs is based on our estimate of the final expected value of the award, and is adjusted as required for the portion based on the performance-based condition.  The Company assumes that forfeitures will be minimal, and recognizes forfeitures as they occur, which results in a reduction in compensation expense.  As the payout of the PSUs includes dividend equivalents, no   separate   dividend yield assumption is required in calculating the fair value of the PSUs.  The recording of compensation expense for PSUs has no impact on net cash flows.    

Restricted Stock Units       A restricted stock unit ( RSU ) represents the right to receive a share of the Company s common stock.  RSUs are eligible to be earned at the end of a specified restricted period, generally   three   years, beginning on the date of grant.  The Company assumes that forfeitures will be minimal, and recognizes forfeitures as they occur, which results in a reduction in compensation expense.    As the payout of the RSUs includes dividend equivalents, no separate dividend yield assumption is required in calculating the fair value of the RSUs.    The following table provides compensation costs for stock-based compensation related to   RSUs  :

The following table summarizes   the     RSU transactions for the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016  :  

The per unit weighted-average fair value at the date of grant for RSUs granted during the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015   was $  32.0  9   and $  25.97  , respectively.      

Stock Options         The following table provides   the income tax benefit   for stock-based compensation related to stock options granted in prior periods: 

For the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015  , there were   no   compensation costs for stock-based compensation related to stock options, as stock options were fully amortized in 2013.  Additionally, t  here were   no   stock options granted during the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016 or 2015  .

Note 9     Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits      

The Company maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan   (the  Pension Plan )  , a nonqualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of its employees.  The net periodic benefit cost is based on estimated values and an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company s employees, mortality, turnover, and medical costs.  The following tables provide the components of net periodic benefit cost:  

Effective July 1, 2015, the Company added a permanent lump sum option to the form of benefit payments offered to participants of the qualified defined benefit pension plan and non-qualified retirement plans upon retirement or termination.  During the first quarter of 2016, the lump sum payments paid to participants who elected this option for payments from the non-qualified retirement plans resulted in a settlement charge.    The Company made cash contributions of   $  8,14  5   to its   Pension Plan   during the first   nine     months of   201  6  ,    which completed the Company   s   2016 cash contributions  .

Note 12     Segment Information    

The Company has identified   ten   operating segments and has   one   reportable segment named the  Regulated  segment.  The reportable segment is comprised of   eight   operating segments for the Company s water and wastewater regulated utility companies which are organized by the states where we provide these services.  In addition,   two   segments are not quantitatively significant to be reportable and are comprised of the   Company s market-based activities:  Aqua Resources, Inc.     and Aqua Infrastructure, LLC.  Aqua Resources   provide  s   water and wastewater service through operating and maintenance contracts with municipal authorities and other parties in close proximity to our utility companies  service territories  ;     and   offers, through a third party, water and   wastewater   line repair service and protection solutions to households  .    In addition, Aqua Resources   provided   liquid waste hauling and disposal services in a business unit that   the Company sold   in the second quarter of 2016  ,     and   that   was   reported as assets held for sale in the Company s consolidated balance sheets included in this report.    Additionally, Aqua Resources   installs and tests devices that prevent the contamination of potable water; designs and builds water and wastewater systems;   and   provides   other   market-based   water and wastewater services   in business units that  ,    in the second quarter of 2016, the Company decided to market for sale  .

a component of  Other  in the tables below.  Also included in  Other  are corporate costs that have not been allocated to the Regulated segment and intersegment eliminations.  Corporate costs include general and administrative expense, and interest expense.  

The following table presents information about the Company s reportable segment:  

Note 13     Commitments and Contingencies    

The Company is routinely involved in various disputes, claims, lawsuits and other regulatory and legal matters, including both asserted and unasserted legal claims, in the ordinary course of business.  The status of each such matter, referred to herein as a loss contingency, is reviewed and assessed in accordance with applicable accounting rules regarding the nature of the matter, the likelihood that a loss will be incurred, and the amounts involved.  As of   September   30  , 2016  , the aggregate amount of   $  14,804   is accrued for loss contingencies and is reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as other accrued liabilities and other liabilities.  These accruals represent management s best estimate of probable loss (as defined in the accounting guidance) for loss contingencies or the low end of a range of losses if

no single probable loss can be estimated.  For some loss contingencies, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of the probable loss or range of probable losses.  While the final outcome of these loss contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable outcomes could negatively impact the Company, at this time in the opinion of management, the final resolution of these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Further, the Company has insurance coverage for certain of these loss contingencies, and as of   September   30  , 2016  , estimates that approximately   $  1,366     of the amount accrued for these matters are probable of recovery through insurance, which amount is also reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as deferred charges and other assets, net. 

In addition to the aforementioned loss contingencies, the Company self-insures its employee medical benefit program, and maintains stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure arising from these claims.  The Company s reserve for these claims totaled   $  1,770   at   September   30  , 2016   and represents a reserve for unpaid claim costs, including an estimate for the cost of incurred but not reported claims.    

Note 14     Income Taxes    

During the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016  , the Company utilized   $  45,412     of its Federal net operating loss   ( NOL )   carryforward.  In addition, during the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016  , the Company   s state NOL carryforward increased by     $  298  .  As of   September   30  , 2016  , the balance of the Company s Federal NOL was   $  112,864  .  The Company believes its Federal NOL carryforward is more likely than not to be recovered and requires   no   valuation allowance.  As of   September   30  , 2016  , the balance of the Company s gross state NOL was   $  563,999  , a portion of which   is   offset by a valuation allowance because the Company does not believe the NOLs are more likely than not to be realized.  The Company s Federal and state NOL carryforwards begin to expire   in   2032   and   2023  , respectively  .        The Company s Federal and state NOL carryforwards are reduced by an unrecognized tax position, on a gross basis, of   $  64,424   and   $  89,364  , respectively.  The amounts of the Company s Federal and state NOL carryforwards prior to being reduced by the unrecognized tax positions were   $  177,  288   and   $  653,364   respectively.  The Company records its unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to its deferred income tax liability.   

In accordance with a 2012 settlement agreement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, Aqua Pennsylvania expenses, for tax purposes,   qualifying utility asset improvement costs  , which   result  s   in a substantial reduction in income tax expense and greater net income and cash flows.  The Company s effective income tax rate for the   third     quarter of 201  6   and   201  5   was   10.3%   and   12.4%  , respectively  , and for the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015 was   8.4  %   and   9.9  %  , respectively  .   

As of   September   30  , 2016  , the total gross unrecognized tax benefit was   $  28,735  , of which   $  20,673  , if recognized, would affect the Company s effective tax rate as a result of the regulatory treatment afforded   for   qualifying infrastructure improvements   in Pennsylvania.  At December 31, 201  5  , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of   $28,016  .   

Accounting rules for uncertain tax positions specify that tax positions for which the timing of resolution is uncertain should be classified as long-term liabilities.  Judgment is required in evaluating the Company s uncertain tax positions and determining the provision for income taxes.  Management

believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.  Although the timing of income tax audit resolutions and negotiations with taxing authorities is highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months. 

Note 15     Recent Accounting Pronouncements      

In August 2016, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated cash flow statement.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on simplifying the accounting for share-based payment  s  , which   includes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.       The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim p  e  r  iods within those fiscal years, with early adoption available.  The Company   has evaluated   the requirements of the updated guidance   and has   determine  d     that upon   adoption  ,     on January 1, 2017,   the   Company will recognize a previously unrecognized   windfall   tax   benefit     for stock  -based   compensation   of $2,805 ($1,823 after-tax), associated with the Company s 2012 Federal net operating loss, which will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings  .    Additionally,   once adopted  , income t  ax benefits in excess of compensation costs or tax deficiencies   for share-based compensation will be recorded to our income tax provision, instead of historically to stockholder s equity, which will impact our effective tax rate.  Lastly, all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments will be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows, a change from the historical requirement to present tax benefits as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities.               

In February 2016, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to establish a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  For income statement purposes, leases will be classified as either operating or finance.  Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern.  The updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption available.  The Company is evaluating the requirements of the updated guidance to determine the impact of adoption. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on   simplifying measurement-period adjustment in business combinations, which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment.  The Company   adopted   the provisions of this accounting standard  ,    as required on January 1, 2016, and it   did not   have a  n   impact on its results of operations or financial position.

In April 2015, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability.  Previously, debt issuance costs were presented in the balance sheet as a deferred charge.      The Company   adopted   the provisions of this accounting standard     as required on   January 1, 2016  .      The adoption of this standard was applied retrospectively and   resulted in the reclassification of   $23,165   from deferred charges and other assets, net to debt issuance costs  , which is reported as a reduction to long-term debt,     in the December 31, 2015   consolidated balance sheet  .   

In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that will require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosures in circumstances in which substantial doubt exists.  The accounting standard   is   effective   in the first annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2016  .  The Company does not expect the provisions of this accounting standard to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized.  The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  The updated guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.    In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral to the original effective date of this guidance.    The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 201  7  , and will be applied retrospectively  .  The Company is evaluating the requirements of the updated guidance to determine the impact of adoption.

General Information    

Aqua America, Inc. ( we   ,     us   ,  our  or the  Company   ), a Pennsylvania corporation, is the holding company for regulated utilities providing water or wastewater services to what we estimate to be   almost     three   million people in Pennsylvania, Ohio,   Texas,   Illinois,   North Carolina  , New Jersey, Indiana,   and   Virginia.  Our largest operating subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania  ,    provides water or wastewater services to approximately one-half of the total number of people we serve,   who are   located in the suburban areas   in counties   north and west of the City of Philadelphia and in   27   other counties in Pennsylvania.  Our other   regulated utility   subsidiaries provide similar services in   seven   other states.

devices that prevent the contamination of potable water   and     repairs   water and wastewater systems, which   in the second quarter of 2016, the Company decided to market for sale  .    Further, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company decided to   market for sale   a business unit within Aqua Resources, which inspects, cleans and repairs storm and sanitary wastewater lines.   These business units are   reported as assets held for sale in the Company s consolidated balance sheets included in this report.    Aqua Infrastructure provides non-utility raw water supply services for firms in the natural gas drilling industry.    

Aqua America, Inc., which prior to its name change in 2004 was known as Philadelphia Suburban Corporation, was formed in 1968 as a holding company for its primary subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania, formerly known as Philadelphia Suburban Water Company.  In the early 1990s, we embarked on a growth-through-acquisition strategy focused on water and wastewater operations.  Our most significant transactions to date have been the merger with Consumers Water Company in 1999, the acquisition of the regulated water and wastewater operations of AquaSource, Inc. in 2003, the acquisition of Heater Utilities, Inc. in 2004, and the acquisition of American Water Works Company, Inc. s regulated operations in Ohio in 2012.  Since the early 1990s, our business strategy has been primarily directed toward the regulated water and wastewater utility industry, where we have more than quadrupled the number of regulated customers we serve, and has extended our regulated operations from southeastern Pennsylvania to include operations in seven other states.    Currently, the Company seeks to acquire businesses in the U.S. regulated sector  , which includes water and wastewater utilities and other regulated utilities,   and to pursue growth ventures in market-based activities  , such as infrastructure opportunities   that are supplementary and complementary to our regulated businesses. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

Financial Condition 

During the first   nine   months of 2016, we had   $270,019   of capital expenditures, expended   $5,626   for the acquisition of water and wastewater utility systems, issued   $234,288   of long-term debt, and repaid debt and made sinking fund contributions and other loan repayments of   $181,359  . The capital expenditures were related to new and replacement water mains, improvements to treatment plants, tanks, hydrants, and service lines, well and booster improvements, and other enhancements and improvements.  The issuance of long-term debt was comprised principally of the funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility.  In addition, we issued 439,943 shares of the Company s common stock,     and   paid   $3,905 in cash   for the acquisition of Superior Water Company, Inc. as described in Note 3     Acquisitions  .          

At     September   30  , 2016, we had   $3,712   of cash and cash equivalents compared to   $3,229   at December 31, 2015.  During the first   nine   months of 2016, we used the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and internally generated funds to fund the cash requirements discussed above and to pay dividends.     

At   September   30  , 2016, our $250,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, which was amended and now expires in February 2021, had $  72,034   available for borrowing.  At   September   30  , 2016, we had short-term lines of credit of $135,500, of which $  87,510   was available for borrowing.  One of our short-term

lines of credit is an Aqua Pennsylvania $100,000 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with four banks, which is used to provide working capital, and as of   September   30  , 2016, $  53,000   was available for borrowing.   

Our short-term lines of credit of $135,500 are subject to renewal on an annual basis.  Although we believe we will be able to renew these facilities, there is no assurance that they will be renewed, or what the terms of any such renewal will be.      

The Company s consolidated balance sheet historically has had a negative working capital position whereby routinely our current liabilities exceed our current assets.  Management believes that internally generated funds along with existing credit facilities and the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt will be adequate to provide sufficient working capital to maintain normal operations and to meet our financing requirements for at least the next twelve months  .  

Results of Operations    

Analysis of   Third   Quarter of 2016 Compared to   Third   Quarter of 2015  

Revenues   increased     by   $5,542   or   2.5%  , primarily   due to   a  n     increase in   customer water consumption,    additional water and wastewater revenues of $  1,337   associated with a larger customer base due to utility acquisitions,   an increase in water rates of $1,234, and   an increase in infrastructure rehabilitation surcharges of $  1,120, offset by a decrease   in   market-based activities revenue of $3,668  .    The market-based activities revenues decreased due to   a reduction in revenues associated with   the inspection, cleaning and repairing of storm and sanitary wastewater lines,   and the second quarter of 2016 sale of a business unit that provided   liquid waste hauling and disposal services  .       

Operations and maintenance   expenses   increased   by   $1,293   or   1.6%  , primarily due to     an increase in postretirement benefits expense of $  1,491, an asset impairment of $970 associated with the   planned   disposition of a business unit within Aqua Resources,     and   additional   operating costs associated with acquired utility systems of $  413  , offset by   the effect of the recording of a legal contingency reserve of $1,580 in the third quarter of 2015,   and   a reduction in operating expenses for Aqua Resources of $602 associated with the disposition of business units  .     

Depreciation expense   increased   by   $1,900   or   5.9%  , primarily due to     the     utility plant placed in service since   September   30  , 2015  .  

Interest expense   increased   by   $929   or   4.8%  , primarily due to an increase in average borrowings  , offset by a decrease in our effective interest rate  .   

Allowance for funds used during construction ( AFUDC )   increased   by   $559  , due to an increase in the average balance of utility plant construction work in progress, to which AFUDC is applied.

(In thousands of dollars, except per share amounts) 

Equity   earnings   in joint venture increased by $2,319 primarily due   to the recognition of a connection fee earned by the joint venture in the third quarter of 201  6 for which our share was $1,831   and   a reduction in depreciation expense resulting from the noncash impairment charge recognized by the joint venture on its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Our effective income tax rate was   10.3%   in the   third     quarter of 201  6   and   12.4%   in the   third     quarter of 201  5  .  The effective income tax rate   decreased   due to   the effect of   additional   tax deductions recognized in the   third   quarter of 2016   for certain qualifying infrastructure improvements for Aqua Pennsylvania.       

Net income   increased   by   $5,741   or   8.5%  , primarily as a result of the factors described above.   

Analysis of First   Nine   Months of 2016 Compared to First   Nine   Months of 2015  

Revenues increased   by   $  5,939     or   1.0  %  , primarily   due to additional water and wastewater revenues of $  6,966   associated with a larger customer base due to utility acquisitions,   an increase in infrastructure rehabilitation surcharges of $  3,536  , and   an increase in water and wastewater rates of $  3,195  , offset by a decrease in market-based activities revenues of $  9,873  .    The market-based activities revenues decreased due to   a reduction in revenues associated with the inspection, cleaning and repairing of storm and sanitary wastewater lines, and the second quarter of 2016 sale of a business unit that provided   liquid waste hauling and disposal services  .       

Operations and maintenance   expenses   decreased   by   $  4,107   or   1.8  %  , primarily due to     the effects of the recognition in 2015 of the following three events:  $2,329 for leadership transition expenses; operating costs of $1,862 for the recording of a reserve for water rights held for future use; and the recording of a legal contingency reserve of $1,580,   as well as   decreases in market-based activities expenses of $  3,810  ,    a decrease in   water production costs of $  2,  182  ,    a reversal of a reserve for a legal contingency of $1,580,   a gain of $1,135   that   was   recognized for the buyout of an operating contract,   and lower fuel costs of $1,016,   offset by     increases in   operating costs associated with acquired utility systems of $  4,038  , postretirement benefits expense of $  4,021  ,    the Company s self-insured employee medical benefit program expense of $  1,271, and an asset impairment of $970 associated with the disposition of a business unit within Aqua Resources  .     

Depreciation expense increased   by   $  4,115   or   4.4  %  , primarily due to     the     utility plant placed in service since   September   30, 2015  .
