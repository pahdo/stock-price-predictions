1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of MedeFile International Inc., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ),
have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial statements. These
unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, these unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature and which are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company
as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared contemplating a continuation of the Company as a going concern. However,
the Company has reported a net loss of $318,249 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and has negative working capital
of $322,019 as of September 30, 2016.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The operating losses
and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's
ability to obtain additional financing depends on the success of its growth strategy and its future performance, each of which
is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond the Company's control.  

We
will need additional investments in order to continue operations. Additional investments are being sought, but we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to obtain such investments. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities,
obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.  

However,
the trading price of our common stock could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt
securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, we may incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant
amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Further, if
we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may
have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. If additional financing is not
available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail our operations.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Cash
and Equivalents, Deposits In-Transit, Receivables, Prepaid and Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Salaries and Wages
and Other Current Liabilities   

The
carrying amounts of these items approximated fair value.  

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC Topic 820-10-35 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).  

Level 1  Valuations
based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.  

Level 2  Valuations
based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  

Level 3  Valuations
based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market
participants. These valuations require significant judgment.  

The
application of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under Topic 820-10-35 to our assets and liabilities as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are described below:  

Derivative
liability as of September 30, 2016 is $11,662, compared to $19,067 as of December 31, 2015.  

   2.
NOTE PAYABLE   RELATED PARTY   

  During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into five unsecured 7% Promissory Notes with a significant shareholder.
The notes mature four to twelve months from issuance and total $175,000.  

  The
changes in notes payable to related party consisted of the following during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

On
July 15, 2016, the Company entered into an unsecured 7% Promissory Notes in the amount of $100,000 with a significant shareholder.
The note has a one year term.  

  The
changes in notes payable consisted of the following during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

3.
CONVERTIBLE DEBEBTURE   RELATED PARTY   

  The
Company has entered into two 10% Secured Convertible Debentures with a significant shareholder, one in the amount of $50,000 on
November 4, 2013 and the other in the amount of $60,000 on December 17, 2013. The debentures carry a one year term. Both debentures
are convertible into common stock at a share price of the lower of $2.00 or 80% of the previous day s closing price. During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the lender converted $40,000 of the note principal and the Company made a payment of $70,000.  

  The
outstanding notes payable to related party consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

4.
DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   

In
connection with certain securities purchase agreements entered into during the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of
2012, the Company granted warrants with ratchet provisions. The warrants expired four years from the date of grant. During the
first two years of grant, if the Company were to issue additional shares of common stock at a price per share less than the exercise
price in effect, the exercise price would be adjusted to equal the average price per share received by the Company for the additional
shares issued. After the first two years following the issuance date, if the Company were to issue any additional shares of common
stock at a price per share less than the exercise price in effect, the exercise price would be adjusted using a formula based
on the existing exercise price, the outstanding shares before and after the issuance of such shares, and the average price during
the issuance of such shares. In addition to the exercise price adjustment, the number of shares upon exercise of the warrants
was also subject to adjustment.  

Upon
grant, the Company assesses the fair value of the warrants using the Black Scholes pricing model and records a warrant liability
for the value. The Company then assesses the fair value of the warrants quarterly based on the Black Scholes Model and increases
or decreases the warrant liability to the new value, and records a corresponding gain or loss (see below for variables used in
assessing the fair value).  

  Due
to the ratchet provisions, the Company treats the warrants as a derivative liability in accordance with the provisions of ASC
815  Derivatives and Hedging  (ASC 815). ASC 815 applies to any freestanding financial instruments or embedded features
that have the characteristics of a derivative and to any freestanding financial instruments that potentially settle in an entity s
own common stock.  

  Transactions
involving warrants with ratchet provisions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows: All remaining warrants
have expired.  

The
change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability consisted of the following during the nine months ended September 30,
2016:  

September 30,   2016     
 
     Warrant liability (beginning fair value)    
     $  1,271     
 
     Additional liability due to new grants    
        -     
 
     Loss (gain) on changes in fair market value of warrant liability    
        (1,271  )  
 
     Warrant liability (ending fair value)    
     $  -     

Change
in fair market value of warrant liability resulted in a gain of $1,271 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

  The
Company entered into two 10% Secured Convertible Debentures with a significant shareholder, one in the amount of $50,000 on November
4, 2013 and the other in the amount of $60,000 on December 17, 2013. The debentures carry a one year term. The Debentures are
convertible into common stock at a share price of the lower of $2.00 or 80% of the previous day s closing price.  

  The
Company assesses the fair value of the convertible debenture using the Black Scholes pricing model and records a derivative liability
for the value. The Company then assesses the fair value of the warrants quarterly based on the Black Scholes Model and increases
or decreases the liability to the new value, and records a corresponding gain or loss (see below for variables used in assessing
the fair value).  

  Due
to the variable conversion rates, the Company treats the convertible debenture as a derivative liability in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging  (ASC 815). ASC 815 applies to any freestanding financial instruments
or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative and to any freestanding financial instruments that potentially
settle in an entity s own common stock. The fair value of the conversion options was determined using the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Model and the following significant assumptions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The
change in fair value of the conversion option derivative liability consisted of the following during the nine months ended September
30, 2016:  

September 30,   2016     
 
     Conversion option liability (beginning fair value)    
     $  17,796     
 
     Additional liability due to new grants    
        -     
 
     Loss (gain) on changes in fair market value of derivative liability    
        (6,134  )  
 
     Conversion option liability (ending fair value)    
     $  11,662     

Change
in fair market value of conversion option liability resulted in a gain of $6,134 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016.  

   6.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT   

  On
October 27, 2016 the Company entered into an additional 7% Promissory Note with a significant shareholder in the amount of $12,000.
The note has a six month term.

OVERVIEW   

Organizational
History   

On
November 1, 2005, Bio-Solutions International, Inc. ( Bio-Solutions ) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
 Agreement ) with OmniMed Acquisition Corp., (the  Acquirer), a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Bio-Solutions, OmniMed International, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( OmniMed ), and the shareholders of OmniMed (the
 OmniMed Shareholders ). Pursuant to the Agreement, Bio-Solutions acquired all of the outstanding equity stock of OmniMed
from the OmniMed Shareholders.  

As
a result of the Agreement, the OmniMed Shareholders assumed control of Bio-Solutions. Effective November 21, 2005, Bio-Solutions
changed its name to OmniMed International, Inc. Effective January 17, 2006, OmniMed changed its name to MedeFile International,
Inc. ( MedeFile  or the  Company ).  

Overview
of Business    

MedeFile
International, Inc., through its MedeFile, Inc. subsidiary, has developed and globally markets a proprietary, patient-centric,
Internet-enabled Personal Health Record (iPHR) system for gathering, digitizing, maintaining, accessing and sharing an individual s
actual medical records. Our goal is to revolutionize the medical industry by bringing patient-centric digital technology to the
business of medicine. We intend to accomplish our objective by providing individuals with a simple and secure way to access their
lifetime of actual medical records in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Our products and services are designed to provide
healthcare providers with the ability to reference their patient's actual past medical records, thereby ensuring the most accurate
treatment and services possible while simultaneously reducing redundant procedures.  

Interoperable
with most electronic medical record systems utilized by physician practices, clinics, hospitals and other care providers, the
highly secure, feature-rich MedeFileiPHR solution has been designed to gather all of its members  actual medical records
on behalf of each member, and create a single, comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR).  The member can access
his/her records 24-hours a day, seven days a week   or authorize a third party user   on any web-enabled device (PC,
cell phone, PDA, e-reader, et al), as well as the portable MedeFile flash drive/keychain or branded UBS-bracelet.  

By
subscribing to the MedeFile system, members can empower themselves to take control of their own health and well-being, as well
as empower their healthcare providers to make sound and lifesaving decisions with the most accurate, up-to-date medical information
available.  In addition, with MedeFile, members enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their medical records
are protected from fire, natural disaster, document misplacement or the closing of a medical or dental practice.  

We
believe we enjoy a number of direct, competitive advantages over others in the medical records marketplace, including that:  

we have developed products and services geared to the patient, which also have the depth and breadth of information required by treating physicians and medical personnel  

we do all the work of collecting and updating medical information on an ongoing basis; our products  dependence on the patient taking action is minimal   particularly when compared to patient action required to support competing solutions.  

we provide a complete medical record.  Other companies claim complete longitudinal records, but in reality only provide histories (usually completed by the member/patient), which are by no means complete or necessarily accurate records  

we provide a coherent mix of services and products that are intended to improve the quality of healthcare by enabling the patient to manage and access the information normally retained by doctors and other care providers.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

FOR
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenues   

Revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $9,608 compared to revenues of $10,869 during the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in membership revenue is primarily related to amount of members and medical record reimbursement
revenue received from members. Medical record reimbursement revenue is a dollar for dollar reimbursement for charges from members 
doctors for sending updated medical records to MedeFile. The off-setting expense is charged to selling general and administrative
expense. Revenues received from memberships are recognized through the period of the membership, and, therefore, revenue
recognized represents a fraction of the membership in the quarter being reported.     

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $106,041, a decrease of $16,804 or approximately
13.7% compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $122,845 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease was due mainly to decreased payroll, legal expense, and consulting fees.  

Amortization
Expense   

Amortization
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0, compared to $22,148 the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Amortization expense in 2015 is the expensing of the website development. Website costs were impaired in the previous year
and the Company incurred an impairment expense of $182,195  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense on convertible debentures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $5,021 and $370 respectively. The
Company entered into two secured convertible debentures during the third quarter of 2013. The notes have a one year
term at a 10% interest rate. The Company entered into additional 7% promissory notes in 2016 (see Note 2 and 3 to the accompanying
financial statements).  

Other
Expense   

Gain
on change in fair value of derivate liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,460 compared to a gain of
$1,072 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Loss   

For
the reasons stated above, our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $93,994, or $0.00 per share, a decrease
of $39,708, compared to net loss of $133,702, or $0.00 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The significant
change is primarily related to adjustments in the fair value of our derivative liability and a decrease in our general and administrative
and compensation expenses.    

FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenues   

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $25,101 compared to revenues of $36,199 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  The decrease in membership revenue is primarily related to amount of members and medical record reimbursement
revenue received from members. Medical record reimbursement revenue is a dollar for dollar reimbursement for charges from members 
doctors for sending updated medical records to MedeFile. The off-setting expense is charged to selling general and administrative
expense. Revenues received from memberships are recognized through the period of the membership, and, therefore, revenue
recognized represents a fraction of the membership in the quarter being reported.     

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $342,236, a decrease of $220,333 or approximately
39.2% compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $562,569 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
was due mainly to decreased payroll, legal expense, and consulting fees.

expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0, compared to $66,447 the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Amortization
expense in 2015 is the expensing of the website development. Website costs were impaired in the previous year and the Company
incurred an impairment expense of $182,195  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $8,519 and $2,763 respectively.   The Company
entered into two secured convertible debentures during the third quarter of 2013.  The notes have a one year term at
a 10% interest rate. The Company entered into 7% promissory notes in 2016 (see Note 2 and 3 to the accompanying financial statements).  

Other
Expense   

Change
in fair value of derivate liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a gain of $7,405 compared to a loss of
$1,958 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Loss   

For
the reasons stated above, our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $318,249, or $0.01 per share, a decrease
of $280,113, compared to net loss of $598,362, or $0.03 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The significant
change is primarily related to adjustments in the fair value of our derivative liability and a decrease in our general and administrative
and compensation expenses.    

FINANCIAL
CONDITION   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,584, and merchant services reserve of $2,938.  Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $310,787. Our current liabilities
as of September 30, 2016 of $327,541 consisted of: $16,525 for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, deferred revenues of
$154, convertible debenture of $16,868, note payable   related party of $282,332, and derivative liability of $11,662. We
have negative working capital of $322,019 as of September 30, 2016.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared contemplating a continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company
has reported a net loss of $318,249 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and had an accumulated deficit of $28,829,648
as of September 30, 2016.  

The
Company currently estimates that it will require approximately $420,000 to continue its operations for the next twelve months.  Additional
investments are being sought, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such investments. Financing transactions
may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the
trading price of our common stock and conditions in the U.S. stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing
through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could
incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements
that would force us to seek alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may
experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing
holders of our common stock. If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to
curtail our operations  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016 or as of the date of this report.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses,
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  

We
base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. While there are a number
of significant accounting policies affecting our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe the following critical
accounting policies involve the most complex, difficult and subjective estimates and judgments:  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company generates revenue from licensing the right to utilize its proprietary software for the storage and distribution of healthcare
information to individuals and affinity groups. For revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue on four basic criteria
which must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
(4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability
of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been
delivered or no refund will be required.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for all compensation related to stock, options or warrants using a fair value based method whereby compensation
cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually
the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of options and warrants issued
to both employees and non-employees. Stock issued for compensation is valued using the market price of the stock on the date of
the related agreement.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Not
required for a smaller reporting company.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )
are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive and Financial Officer) of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive and Financial Officer) concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and also are not effective
in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive and Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Management
concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because the following material
weaknesses exist:  

Our chief executive officer also functions as our chief financial officer.  As a result, our officers may not be able to identify errors and irregularities in the financial statements and reports.  

We were unable to maintain full segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function.  

Documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.  

To
the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses,
including, but not limited to, increasing the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies
and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
