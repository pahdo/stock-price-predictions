    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)      1. Basis of Presentation
    The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for
complete financial statements. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal and recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Due to the seasonality of our business, results for any
quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 11, 2016.  
 As used herein, the terms  we,   our,   us  and  Stein Mart  refer to Stein Mart, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries.    Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2015 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to conform to classifications
used in 2016.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15  Statement of
Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . The amendments in this ASU introduce clarifications to the presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary
updates include additions and clarifications of the classification of cash flows related to certain debt repayment activities, contingent consideration payments related to business combinations, proceeds from insurance policies, distributions from
equity method investees and cash flows related to securitized receivables. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted,
including in interim periods. The ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented upon adoption. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 was completed in the current period and did not affect our cash flows as we were already in
compliance with the ASU.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This update requires organizations to recognize
lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and also disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the overall effect the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows, but we currently believe the adoption of this ASU will have a significant effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.    In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  and subsequent clarifications. ASU No. 2014-09 will replace almost all existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, upon its effective
date. The standard s core principle is for a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled. A company may also need to use
more judgment and make more estimates when recognizing revenue, which could result in additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 also provides guidance for transactions that were not addressed comprehensively in previous guidance, such as the recognition
of breakage income from the sale of gift cards. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2017 (our fiscal year 2018). Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We plan to adopt this ASU in the fiscal
year 2018 and utilize a cumulative effect of applying this ASU recognized at the date of initial application. While we are still in the process of evaluating the effect that these ASU s may have on our financial statements, we do not currently
expect a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     2. Shareholders  Equity   
  Dividends     During the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, we
paid three quarterly dividends of $0.075 per common share on April 15, 2016, July 15, 2016 and October 14, 2016. During the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015, we paid three quarterly dividends of $0.075 per common share on April 17, 2015, July 17,
2015 and October 16, 2015.  
      7  

On February 4, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.00 per
common share, which was paid on February 27, 2015. As a result of the special cash dividend, all outstanding stock options and performance share awards were modified during 2015 so that they retained the same fair value. No incremental compensation
expense resulted from these modifications.     Stock Repurchase Plan   
 During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, we repurchased 15,999 shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $0.1 million. During the 13 weeks
ended October 31, 2015, we repurchased 14,842 shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $0.1 million. During the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, we repurchased 166,657 shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately
$1.1 million. During the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015, we repurchased 213,815 shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $3.2 million. Stock repurchases were for tax withholding amounts due on employee stock awards and during the
first 39 weeks of 2016 and 2015 included no shares purchased on the open market under our previously authorized stock repurchase plan. As of October 29, 2016, there are 554,217 shares that can be repurchased pursuant to the Board of Director s
current authorization.     3. Earnings per Share     Our
restricted stock awards granted in 2013 and prior contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and, as such, are considered participating securities. Participating securities are to be included in the calculation of earnings per share under the
two-class method. In applying the two-class method, income is allocated to both common stock shares and participating securities based on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period.  
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):  
   
   Due to the Company s net loss position for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, 0.1 million and 0.4 million weighted
average unvested restricted shares (participating securities) and 1.1 million and 1.3 million weighted average common stock equivalents (non-participating securities), respectively, were not considered in the calculation of net loss available to
common shareholders used for diluted EPS for the quarter.    Options totaling approximately 1.4 million and 2.1 million shares of common stock that were
outstanding during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Options totaling approximately 0.4 million
and 0.2 million shares of common stock that were outstanding during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive.  
      8  

4. Commitments and Contingencies   
 We are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. During both the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31,
2015, we accrued less than $0.1 million and during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we accrued $1.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for actual and anticipated legal settlements. While some of these matters could be
material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular period if an unfavorable outcome results, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition.

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
 As used herein, the terms  we,   our,   us  and  Stein Mart  refer to Stein Mart, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries.     Forward-Looking Statements     This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties or assumptions and may be
affected by certain factors including, but not limited to, the matters discussed in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. Wherever used, the words  plan, 
 expect,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on
beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to such management. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking
statements in light of new information or future events. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 11, 2016.     Overview   
 We are a national retailer offering the fashion merchandise, service and presentation of a better department or specialty store at prices comparable to
off-price retail chains. Our focused assortment of merchandise features current-season moderate to better fashion apparel for women and men, as well as accessories, shoes and home fashions. We are adding new modern brands to our stores to offer
discriminating shoppers even more of the fashion and savings they want.     Financial Overview for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   

Stores     The following table sets forth the stores
activity for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015.      
 
      10  

Results of Operations   
 The following table sets forth each line item of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as a percentage of net sales (1):  

(1) 
 Table may not foot, due to rounding.       13 and 39 Weeks Ended October 29, 2016, Compared to the 13 and 39
Weeks Ended October 31, 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):      Net Sales   
   
   The 4.6 percent and 3.1 percent decreases in comparable stores sales for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016,
respectively, were both driven by decreases in the number of transactions and average unit retail prices, partially offset by an increase in units per transaction. We continue to implement new strategies designed to acquire new customers, strengthen
loyalty and deliver distinctive merchandise, however, our execution of these initiatives was done too quickly and in ways that negatively affected our core customer and sales in the third quarter. Additionally, comparable store sales decreased due
to the effect that unseasonably warm weather had on cold weather-related sales as well as Hurricane Matthew negatively affecting sales in our southeast coastal stores during October.  
 Comparable store sales reflect stores open throughout the period and prior fiscal year and include Ecommerce sales. Ecommerce sales positively affected
comparable store sales by approximately 0.1 percent and less than 0.1 percent of the comparable store sales for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively. Ecommerce sales contributed approximately 2.2 percent and 1.7 percent of net
sales for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, and approximately 2.0 percent and 1.6 percent of net sales for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Comparable store sales do not
include leased department commissions.     Gross Profit       
   The declines in our gross profit rate as a percentage of net sales for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to
the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015 were driven by higher markdowns in the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 as well as higher  
      11  

occupancy costs that did not leverage on softer sales. The execution of new promotional initiatives negatively affected traffic creating higher markdowns to clear spring merchandise. Gross Profit
was also negatively affected by increased coupon usage and the clearing of current season and non-performing categories, particularly in Men s and Accessories.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG A )       
   Increases in SG A in the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 were driven by
operating expenses for eight additional stores, a $1.4 million charge related to our former CEO s resignation in September and higher advertising expense. These increases were offset by higher credit card program income and operating savings.
Advertising expenses increased due to a combination of our change in media mix, to include additional TV, and promoting our new stores. Our higher credit card program income was due to the improved economics from our new agreement with Synchrony
Financial plus higher penetration.    Increases in SG A in the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015 were
driven operating expenses for 13 additional stores, by a $1.4 million charge related to our former CEO s resignation in September and accruals for actual and anticipated legal settlements. Advertising expenses increased due to a combination of
our change in media mix and promoting our new stores. These increases were partially offset by higher credit card program income and lower store selling expenses. Credit card income was higher due to the improved economics from our new agreement
with Synchrony Financial plus higher penetration.     Interest Expense, net       

   Interest expense for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 increased compared to the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 due
primarily to slightly higher short-term interest rates. The increase in interest expense in the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015 is driven by the 2016 period including three full quarters of interest
expense on our credit facility. In 2015, we did not begin borrowing on our credit facility until the end of February.     Income Taxes   
   
   The effective tax rate for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015
increased primarily due to the effect of permanent differences for certain non-deductible expenses, partially offset by the earlier extension of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     Capital requirements and
working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds, available cash, credit terms from vendors and our $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement
with Wells Fargo Bank. Working capital is used to support store inventories and capital investments for system improvements, fund new store openings, maintain existing stores, pay dividends, make debt service payments and repurchase shares of our
common stock. Historically, our working capital needs are lowest after our heavy spring selling in March and April and holiday selling in late December and early January. They are highest as we begin paying for our heavy spring, fall and holiday
receipts in late February, October and at the end of November. As of October 29, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $14.0 million and $179.7 million in borrowings under our credit facilities. We believe that our cash flows from operations and
our available cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to cover our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months.  
      12  

Cash Flows       
   The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly due to the increase in Accounts Payable, (the third
quarter is our expected seasonal high for company receipts), collections on tenant allowances and a signing bonus related to our new credit card program, partially offset by purchases of inventory.  
 Net cash used in investing activity was entirely for capital expenditures in both periods presented. Capital expenditures were greater for the 39 weeks ended
October 29, 2016 primarily due to an additional thirteen new stores and certain relocated stores in the 39 weeks of 2016 compared to six new stores in 2015.  
 During the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, net cash used in financing activities consisted of debt repayments of $302.7 million, cash dividends paid of $10.4
million and the repurchase of 166,657 shares of our common stock for $1.1 million, offset by proceeds from borrowings of $292.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and ESPP purchases of $1.7 million and excess tax benefit from
share-based compensation of less than $0.1 million.    During the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities consisted of debt
repayments of $341.5 million, cash dividends paid of $235.7 million, the repurchase of 213,815 shares of our common stock for $3.2 million and $0.4 million in debt issuance costs, offset by proceeds from borrowings of $533.3 million, excess tax
benefit from share-based compensation of $3.9 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and ESPP purchases of $0.6 million. Borrowings under our credit facilities were initially used for a special dividend paid during the first quarter
of 2015, and have subsequently been used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. See Note 2  Shareholders  Equity  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016. We have made no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since January 30, 2016.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements     Recently issued
accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1  Basis of Presentation  of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Seasonality and Inflation     Our business is seasonal.
Sales and profitability are historically higher in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, which include the spring and holiday seasons. Therefore, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved
for a full fiscal year.    Although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has
had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.  
    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 For information regarding our exposure to certain market risk, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in Part II, Item 7A
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016. There were no material changes to our market risk during the quarter ended October 29, 2016.  
      13  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 29, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
