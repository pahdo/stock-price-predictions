General    

Amaize
Beverage Corporation, ( the Company ,  the Registrant ,  we ,
 us  or  our ) develops and markets better-for-you 100% natural beverages. The Company s goal is
to successfully position a  better for you  portfolio of beverages as convenient, healthy solutions to support the
lifestyles of today s active health conscious consumers. We commenced sales of our packaged snack products in the third
quarter ended March 31, 2011, although we made no sales during the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015. Our principal executive
office address is 5042 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036 and our telephone number is (949) 287-3164.  

Organization    

Amaize
Beverage Corporation is organized under the laws of the state of Nevada. The  
Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of the Company constituting a total of 9,327,859 shares of common stock (82.83%)
approved as of June 26, 2015, in a written consent of the Board of Directors and the majority of the shareholders of the Company,
a name change from  SnackHealthy, Inc.  to  Amaize Beverage Corporation . The Company believes that its
new name will better reflect the new direction of the Company s business, that of developing and marketing beverages that
provide sustenance and benefit to active and health-conscious consumers. The Company seeks to deliver these health benefits as
it develops products that are all-natural, low-calorie and free from artificial sweeteners. On August 13, 2015, the Company has
filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the  Amendment ) with the Secretary of State of the state of
Nevada. The Amendment provides for the change of the Company name from SnackHealthy, Inc. to its current name, Amaize Beverage
Corporation. The Company s trading symbol was changed by FINRA to  BEVS .  

Business
Overview    

To
more effectively facilitate the process of shifting to retail beverage distribution, in November 2013, Richard Damion joined our
Company as the acting chief executive officer. He was then approved by the Board of Directors as the Company s President
and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014. On February 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed A.R. (Bud)
Grandsaert, age 72, as the Company s new President. Richard Damion resigned as the Company s President as of that
date; however, he remains the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Director.  

We
determined during the first quarter of 2015 that we would transition out of our lower margin, perishable snack food product lines
and have focused our resources solely on developing new healthy beverages. Amaize Beverage Corporation will continue to focus
on developing its healthy beverage product line with a plan to sell to large retailers and club stores in the United States. The
Company recently completed development of a unique  better for you  beverage with purple corn as its primary ingredient.
Purple corn has historical roots of over thousands of years yet is newly rediscovered for its incredible health benefits. Leading
research   development companies in the United States have been gathering data on its health benefits and working on integrating
its benefits into a number of consumer products. The beverage, with super antioxidant status, is a unique blend of fruits and
spices, offering extraordinary health benefits and great taste. Our initial portfolio design includes three beverage lines; Amaize 100%
Natural Purple Corn Beverage, Amaizing Tea  and Amaizing Lemonade . We plan to launch our Amaize  100% Natural
Purple Corn Drink ahead of our blended teas   and blended lemonades to establish our distribution network with a one
of a kind product and to later,   red-carpet   our tea and lemonade beverages through an established distribution
system. The fact that the average American drinks over seven drinks per day allows plenty of opportunity to market a healthy drink,
helping us to achieve our mission of providing a positive healthy delicious beverage .  While there can be no assurance,
management believes that this strategy will ultimately prove successful. The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing
to pursue its business and growth plans, however, no assurances can be given that the Company will obtain the necessary financing.  

We
are a virtual company with a focus on staying lean through the use of cloud based technologies, maintaining low overhead, subcontracting
services, creating sales through commissioned brokers, developing products through reputable co-packers and keeping little to
no inventory except for use in sales and business development activities.  

Industry
wide factors that affect us include the increasing prevalence of obesity in adults and children and a growing demand for healthier
foods and beverages worldwide.  

According
    to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.7 billion adults are overweight and 400 million are obese. By 2015,
    it is predicted that 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and more than 700 million will be obese. Obesity rates among children
    have also climbed, with more than 30 percent now overweight or obese.   

According
                                                                              to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over the last 30 years, obesity among American children ages 6 to 11 has
                                                                              more than doubled.    

Studies
    show that the most effective way to prevent obesity is to address it during childhood by instilling healthy habits which starts
    with the very basis of cutting back on sugary drinks, eating the right foods, and exercising daily.   

Products    

Our
initial portfolio will consist of three beverage lines; Amaize 100% Natural Purple Corn Beverage, Amaizing Tea  and
Amaizing Lemonade . We plan to launch our Amaize  100% Natural Purple Corn Drink ahead of our blended tea and blended
lemonade beverages to establish our distribution network with a one of a kind product. We plan to   red-carpet 
 our Tea and Lemonade beverages through an established distribution system in summer of 2017. The launch of these products
is subject to the Company s ability to obtain additional financing.  

Benefits
of Purple Corn in AMAIZE    

The
beneficial properties of Purple Corn are promising. Current research supports, although it has not been scientifically proven,
daily intake values of 300mg to maximize health benefits and nutritional supports for:  

Heart/Cardiovascular
    Health   

Colon
    Health

    Management

AMAIZE 
100% NATURAL   

Amaize
is a uniquely delicious drink, rich is color and high in antioxidants. It is based on an ancient Peruvian drink made by brewing
purple corn and adding tropical pineapple juice and apple juice. It offers many potential health benefits. Due to the high concentrations
of natural purple pigments known as anthocyanins, Purple Corn is an antioxidant powerhouse. It protects cells from damage by free
radicals, detoxifies, is a powerful anti-inflammatory and lowers blood pressure. Because Purple corn s anthocyanins are
stable when heated, we are able to harness their special properties.  

AMAIZING
LEMONADE   

Amaizing
Lemonade is a 100% Natural Lemonade blended with Purple Corn It is a refreshing take on one of America s favorite beverages.
We plan to extend the line to five distinct and great tasting flavors, offering significantly reduced calories without the use
of artificial sweeteners or coloring. Amaizing Lemonade is being formulated to contain approximately 40% fewer calories than our
competitors and will be the only all lemonade blended with purple corn in the marketplace.  

The
Lemonade Market   

A
brief review of the Lemonade market is in order. Lemonade, that quintessential summertime drink, is becoming a drink for all seasons.
No longer resigned to backyard barbecues and ball games, the category has seen a surge in year-round consumption.  

Lemonade
    is America s second favorite juice drink.   

89%
    of juice drinkers consume lemonade; 36% as a favorite.   

56%
    of all teenagers prefer lemonade in the juice category.   

The
    Lemonade single serve category in 2014 was estimated to be over $184M up 11% from 2013.   

AMAIZING
TEA   

Somewhere
between the pumped-up, sugar-saturated drinks and the tasteless waters, there is a need for a healthier alternative in the tea
category. Our goal is to provide genuine natural taste without the artificially concocted sweeteners and preservatives designed
to compensate for lack of taste. Amaizing Tea will allow people to enjoy the world s second most popular drink the way hundreds
of civilizations and nature intended it to be; a world of flavor freshly brewed and barely sweetened. We plan to blend tea from
around the world with brewed purple corn with an added hint of honey or pure palm sugar. Finally, we will filter Amaizing Tea
to produce a pure genuine taste that doesn t need a disguise. Unlike most of the bottled teas in the marketplace, our formula
for Amaizing Tea does not use bricks of tea dust, tea concentrate, or other artificial sweeteners or acids. The tea will have
no bitter aftertaste or sugar kick, and will not leave a syrupy film on the drinker s teeth.  

Production
and Manufacturing   

Though
it was a long and arduous  learning experience  finding the perfect way to brew the purple corn and blend it with
the appropriate ingredients, we have developed unique brewing tools and techniques which will enable us to manufacture in an efficient
and scalable manner to achieve our desired consistency. We plan to have our Amaize beverage line brewed and bottled at facilities
selected based on numerous criteria including capacity, reputation, quality control, production efficiency and willingness to
invest in a long-term partnership. The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing to pursue its production and manufacturing
plans, however, no assurances can be given that the Company will obtain the necessary financing.  

Target
Market   

Our
primary targeted demographics are 30+ adults who want to feel young and lead active, healthy lives. Our mission and concept is
supported by a growing consumer link between nutrition and wellness and the ever-growing need for convenient solutions. This fact
ensures the product line does not just attract the huge  baby boomer  category but includes all health conscious consumers.  

Product
Launch   

We
plan to launch our initial beverage in the second quarter of 2017. The launch of our initial beverage is subject to the Company s
ability to obtain additional financing. Pre-marketing discussions with distributors are underway and some distributors have expressed
interest in adding the Amaize brand to their line-up. We plan to use in-store sampling as a strategy to educate consumers. In
addition, we plan to advertise via consumer websites, social media outlets and magazines. The Company is currently seeking the
necessary financing to pursue its product launch, however, no assurances can be given that the Company will obtain the necessary
financing.  

Product
Positioning   

We
plan to position our beverages as both an RTD stand-alone and a natural complement to food in an effort to broaden appeal. We
believe we can benefit from the large and growing tea and lemonade markets reflected by the surging sales growth in both categories
in North America and internationally. Our beverages, being all-natural, lower calorie, and  good for you , will be
in-line with our corporate mission to reach a large demographic by aiming to be the one of the healthiest, all-natural beverages
in the marketplace.  

Packaging
and Pricing    

We
plan to have our line of products offered initially in a 16oz. plastic bottle to be followed up with an 8 oz. individual and a
larger 32 oz. Club size. Our bottles, logos and labels will be designed in a very attractive contemporary style with packaging
communicating the attributes of the beverages in several ways:  

By
    using contemporary designed bottles with spot labeling, (i.e. front and back instead of wraparound) our bottles evoke quality
    with more space for the consumer to see the color of our beverages. The rich color of our purple corn drink and our teas with
    a purple hue are very appealing to the eye.   

The
    beauty of our custom bottles are in their simplicity. Our packaging has no flashy slogans, advertising call-outs or marketing
    hype. The package helps condition the consumer s mind for what they are about to experience.   

The
Company is currently seeking the necessary financing to pursue its packaging plans, however, no assurances can be given that the
Company will obtain the necessary financing.  

The
retail price for our 16oz. Amaize  is expected to be between $2.50 and $2.99, considerably less than Pom Wonderful which
usually sells for $3.88. The retail price for a 16oz. teas and lemonades are expected to vary between $1.29 and $2.00 falling
in the middle of the category on a pricing basis.  

Market
Opportunity    

Explosive
Growth in Ready-to-Drink (RTD) Tea and Bottled Water Markets   

Although
carbonated soft drinks still dominate the beverage market, in the past ten years Ready-To-Drink teas and bottled water have emerged
as alternatives. Since 2009 the United States tea market has enjoyed 20% annual growth, with wholesale sales reaching over $10
billion last year. Individual tea consumption has risen to over 9 gallons per capita.  

The
Emergence of Tea Culture   

Arizona
Tea and Snapple have helped make tea accessible to a broader population. Now in the same way that gourmet coffees have become
popular, consumers are beginning to develop an appreciation for finer teas. Over the last six years United States loose leaf tea
sales have more than doubled. According to the Tea Council, there are over a thousand tea houses or tea parlors in the country,
mostly opened within the last two or three years. These parlors focus almost exclusively on tea, products that go with tea as
well as tea hardware. They carry names such as Teaism, TeaLuxe, Elixir Tonics and Teas, and Tea   Company. Even Lipton is
opening a flagship tea bar in Pasadena, California. In addition to the burgeoning of tea cafes, tea culture is spreading in the
form of tea magazines, tea-flavored ice cream, frozen tea ice bars, tea-scented perfume and bubble bath, tea jelly, tea calendars
and even books about tea. The paperback Loving Tea was recently spotted as a  cash register book  at the bookstore,
commanding prime space next to Dilbert and Chicken Soup for the Soul.  

Rise
of Cultural Creatives   

Market
research in the past three years has identified a consumer mindset which would seem to be particularly receptive to  Amaize 
 Beverages, calling them a core consumer element. A study by the market research firm American LIVES identified a subset of
the population, roughly 44 million Americans, which they labeled  Cultural Creatives . Among the key characteristics
and values identified for this group below, make them ideal customers.  

Experiential
    consumers; they want to know where a product came from, how it was made, and who made it.   

Holistic;
    they view nature as sacred and form the core market for alternative health care and natural foods.   

Aggressive
    consumers of cultural products; love of things foreign and exotic.   

Desire
    for authenticity; favoring high integrity over high fashion.   

Disdainful
    of mainstream media and consumerist culture; too superficial, not enough attention to the full story.   

Attuned
    to global issues and whole systems; they have a sense of belonging to a global village.   

Profile
of Target Customer   

When
we combine these above trends and compare them with the demographics of the Cultural Creatives study as well as other market demographic
information, we are able to develop a profile of our target customers:  

60%
    women, 40% men.   

Median
    age 42, with a range from 30-65.   

Likely
    to live near a concentrated urban area.   

Likely
    to have graduated college or have an advanced degree.   

Likely
    to currently be bottled water or RTD drinkers.   

Interested
    in running, hiking and outdoor healthy activities.   

Average
    family income $52,000.

Item
1A. RISK FACTORS   

In
addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our
business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional
risks and uncertainties, including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem insignificant, may also impair our
business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Our
performance may be impacted by general economic conditions and an economic downturn.   

Recessionary
pressures from an overall decline in U.S. economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic
uncertainty may reduce consumer spending in our sales channels and create a shift in consumer preference toward private label
products. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to reduce the prices of
some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could lower our revenues and profitability.
Instability in the financial markets may impact our ability or increase the cost to enter into credit agreements in the future.
Additionally, it may weaken the ability of our customers, suppliers, distributors, banks, insurance companies and other business
partners to perform in the normal course of business, which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely
upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason,
our business could be negatively impacted.  

Volatility
in the price or availability of the inputs we depend on, including raw materials, packaging, energy and labor, could adversely
impact our financial results.   

Our
financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and packaging. Continued
growth would require us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled workforce and talented management team. Any unplanned turnover
or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for current positions could erode our competitiveness. In addition, our
financial results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover
or increased employee benefit costs.  

We
operate in a highly competitive industry.   

Price
competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our financial results. The sales of most of our products are subject
to significant competition primarily through discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors, many of whom are significantly
larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, there is a continuing consolidation in the beverage and snack food
industries, which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more
major customers, lose existing product authorizations at customer locations, lose market share and/or shelf space, increase expenditures
or reduce selling prices, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.  

Sales
price increases initiated by us may negatively impact our financial results. Future price increases, such as those to offset increased
ingredient costs, may reduce our overall sales volume, which could reduce revenues and operating profit. Additionally, if market
prices for certain ingredients decline significantly below our contracted prices, customer pressure to reduce prices could lower
revenues and operating profit.  

The
loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial results and growth prospects.   

There
are risks associated with our ability to retain key employees. If certain key employees terminate their employment, it could negatively
impact sales, marketing or development activities. Further, management s attention might be diverted from operations to
recruiting suitable replacements and our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.
In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for key employees or offer employment to potential replacements
on acceptable terms.  

Efforts
to execute and accomplish our strategic initiatives could adversely affect our financial results.   

If
we are unsuccessful due to our execution, unplanned events, ability to manage change or unfavorable market conditions, our financial
performance could be adversely affected. If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures, we may incur significant
costs and may not be able to consummate the transactions or obtain financing.  

Concerns
with the safety and quality of certain food and beverage products or ingredients could cause consumers to avoid our products.   

We
could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products
or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products
or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and negatively impact our business and financial results.  

If
our products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability
claims if consumers are injured or become sick.   

Product
recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our market share and financial results. We may be required to recall certain
of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings
if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in
any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We may also lose customer confidence
for our entire brand portfolio.  

Disruption
of our supply chain or information technology systems could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.   

Our
ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or
distribution capabilities or the supply and delivery of key inputs, such as raw materials, finished goods, packaging, labor and
energy, could impair our ability to conduct our business. Examples include, but are not limited to, weather, natural disasters,
fires, terrorism, pandemics and strikes. Certain warehouses and manufacturing facilities may be located in areas prone to tornadoes,
hurricanes and floods. Any business disruption due to natural disasters or catastrophic events in these areas could adversely
impact our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated. We also rely on a certain supplier for the manufacturing
of one of our core branded products. Although we have secured back-up suppliers in the case of emergency, any damage or disruption
to this supplier s manufacturing or distribution capabilities could impair our ability to sell this product. Also, we increasingly
rely on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems can enhance efficiency and business processes but
also present risks of unauthorized access to our networks or data centers. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems,
they could obtain and exploit confidential business, customer, or employee information and harm our competitive position. Further,
these information systems may experience damage, failures, interruptions, errors, inefficiencies, attacks or suffer from fires
or natural disasters, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated
by our security measures and disaster recovery plans.  

Improper
use or misuse of social media may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.   

Consumers
are moving away from traditional means of electronic mail towards new forms of electronic communication, including social media.
We support new ways of sharing data and communicating with customers using methods such as social networking. However, misuse
of social networking by individuals, customers, competitors, or employees may result in unfavorable media attention which could
negatively affect our business. Further, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to market and advertise
products. If we are unable to compete in this environment it could adversely affect our financial results.  

Demand
for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market
our products effectively.   

We
are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate
revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences
or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion
of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on the ability to respond to consumer trends, including concerns
of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes and ingredients. In addition, changes in product category
consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a
variety of factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, changes in travel, vacation or leisure
activity patterns, or negative publicity resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in the snack food industry.
Any of these changes may reduce consumers  willingness to purchase our products and negatively impact our financial results.  

Our
continued success also is dependent on product innovation, including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products, and the effectiveness
of advertising campaigns, marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal,
there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products,
or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs. In addition, both the launch and ongoing success of new
products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain, especially as to their appeal to consumers. Further, failure to successfully
launch new products could decrease demand for existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands,
as well as result in inventory write-offs, trademark impairments and other costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial
results.  

Our
distribution network relies on relationships with our distributors, and such reliance could affect our ability to efficiently
and profitably distribute and market products, maintain existing markets and expand business into other geographic markets.   

Our
business relies upon a significant number of distribution relationships for the sale and distribution of our products. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks related to all or any of these factors in any of the current or prospective
geographic areas of distribution. To the extent that any of these factors have an adverse effect on the relationships with consultants,
companies or retailers in a particular geographic area and, thus, limit our ability to maintain and expand the sales market, revenues
and financial results may be adversely impacted.  

There
also is no assurance that we will be able to maintain distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships
in new geographic distribution areas. There is the possibility that we will have to incur significant expenses to attract and
maintain relationships in one or more geographic distribution areas in order to profitably expand geographic markets. The occurrence
of any of these factors could result in a significant decrease in sales volume of our branded products and the products which
we distribute for others and harm our business and financial results.  

Continued
success depends on the protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.   

We
will maintain trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which are important to our success and competitive position,
and the loss of or our inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business.
We will devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual
property rights on a worldwide basis. Efforts to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property
rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our
products. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow for the protection of proprietary
rights to the same extent as in the United States and other countries.  

New
regulations or legislation could adversely affect our business and financial results.   

Food
and beverage production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state and other governmental agencies. New
or increased government regulation of the food and beverage industry, including but not limited to areas related to product safety,
chemical composition, production processes, traceability, product quality, packaging, labeling, school lunch guidelines, promotions,
marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children), product recalls, records, storage
and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of
operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or society factors, such as obesity, nutritional and environmental
concerns and diet trends.  

A
significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is controlled by a few individuals, and their interests may conflict
with those of other stockholders.   

The
founder of the Company, Katherine T. West beneficially owns a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Mrs. West
currently serves as the Chairman of the Board. As a result, she may be able to exercise significant influence over the Company
and certain matters requiring approval of its stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, such
as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets. This could limit the ability of other stockholders of the Company to influence
corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company. In addition,
Mrs. West may have actual or potential interests that diverge from the interests of the other stockholders of the Company. Sales
by Mrs. West, or other majority shareholders, of their shares into the public market, or the perception that such sales could
occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  

We
may be unable to comply with our reporting and other requirements under federal securities laws.   

As
a publicly traded company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
the  Exchange Act  and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act . In addition, the Exchange
Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely
manner could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we, among other things, establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures
for financial reporting. From time to time we evaluate our existing internal controls in light of the standards adopted by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It is possible that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure or
difficulties in implementing and maintaining these controls could cause us to fail to meet the periodic reporting obligations
or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.  

Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence
in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our common
stock.  

We
are, and in the future may be, subject to legal or administrative actions that could adversely affect our results of operations
and our business.   

We
could incur substantial legal fees and other expenses in connection with legal or administrative matters, which could adversely
affect our results of operations. These matters also may distract the time and attention of our officers and directors or divert
our other resources away from our ongoing commercial and development programs. An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters
could damage our business and reputation or result in additional claims or proceedings against us.  

We
have virtually no financial resources. Our independent registered auditors  report includes an explanatory paragraph stating
that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   

We
have decided to change our business strategy and as a result of that process which has not been completed yet, we have virtually
no financial resources. Our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our financial
statements as of and for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 that states that Company losses from operations raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. We will seek additional financing in the future. Financing sought may
be in the form of equity or debt financing from various sources as yet unidentified. Most, if not all of our efforts have been
spent on our change of business strategy and developing our new healthy beverage business plan, however, we will seek necessary
additional financing to pursue our business and growth plans. No assurances can be given that the Company will generate sufficient
revenue or obtain the necessary financing to continue as a going concern.  

Our
internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being
disseminated to the public.   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  

pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the Company;   

provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and   

provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Our
internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.  

The
interests of shareholders may be hurt because we can issue shares of our common stock to individuals or entities that support
existing management with such issuances serving to enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of our company.   

Our
board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued
common shares. Such issuances may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management and the interests
of existing management which may not be the same as the interests of other shareholders. Our ability to issue shares without shareholder
approval serves to enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of our company.  

Any
market that develops in shares of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock regulations and restrictions pertaining
to low priced stocks that will create a lack of liquidity and make trading difficult or impossible.   

The
trading of our securities is on the OTCBB as maintained by FINRA and the OTCQB as maintained by the OTC Markets. As a result,
an investor may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our securities.  

Rule
3a51-1 of the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a  penny stock,  for purposes relevant to us, as any equity
security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject
to a limited number of exceptions which are not available to us. It is likely that our shares will be considered to be penny stocks
for the immediate foreseeable future. This classification severely and adversely affects any market liquidity for our common stock.  

For
any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction
setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s account for transactions
in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person
and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.
The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth: the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability
determination, and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.  

Disclosure
also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions 
payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and
remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Additionally, monthly statements have to be sent
disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.  

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or
may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders
or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in
any secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities.  

Because
we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures, our stockholders
have limited protection against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.   

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC, the New York and American Stock Exchanges
and the Nasdaq Stock Market, as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate
governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply
to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with
many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated
with such compliance any sooner than legally required, we have not yet adopted these measures.  

Because
none of our directors (currently two persons) are independent directors, we do not currently have an independent audit or a compensation
committee. As a result, directors have the ability, among other things, to determine their own level of compensation. Until we
comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards
of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of
interest, if any, and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.  

We
intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to director independence as and when required. However, we may
find it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required
to provide for our effective management as a result of Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors
and executive officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may make it more costly or
deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles.

2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES   

The
Company gave up its leased office space in Florida in January 2014 and acquired a new office in California. The Florida leaseholder
obtained a judgment in the amount of $181,968 for the remainder of the monthly lease payments through June 2016 pursuant to the
terms of the lease agreement plus legal fees of $1,487. The Company has recorded the full amount of the judgment, however, it
believes that when the facility is re-leased it may not have to pay the full amount. Upon the leaseholder s execution of
a new lease with a new tenant, the Company plans to file for the release of the amount of the judgment over and above the actual
loss incurred by the leaseholder. There is no guarantee the property will be re-leased or that such a filing will be successful
and that the Company will be able to mitigate its loss in this way.  

In
January 2014, the Company entered into the California lease at the rate of $1,439 per month but vacated this property in December
2014. There is no outstanding liability in respect of this lease.  

In
January 2015, the Company equipped itself to operate through cloud-based technologies. Our existing arrangement consists of mailing
address services on a no contract, month-to-month basis and a la carte access to hosting facilities, virtual pbx telephone, conference
space, cloud-based file sharing and file storage which is highly cost effective. Our current corporate address, 5042 Wilshire
Blvd, # 34708, Los Angles, California, 90036 is a mailing address at an office center provided by a director at a cost of $150
per month and is adequate to meet our current requirements. The Company will seek suitable office space when needed.  

The
Company has not invested in any real property at this time, nor does the Company intend to do so. The Company has no formal policy
with respect to investments in real estate or investments with persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.  

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

In
June 2013, a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its President and directors alleging several
counts, including a breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and seeking damages in the amount of $122,300 and other unspecified
damages. On March 20, 2015 the court entered a final judgment in the amount of $200,761 comprised of the principal amount of $122,344
plus prejudgment interest from September 15, 2012 through the date of judgment in the amount of $54,421, costs in the amount of
$773, and attorney s fees of $23,222. A full provision for this liability has been recorded in our financial statements
during the year ended June 30, 2015. The court dismissed the case against any party not listed in the final order and the case
is now closed as to all parties (see  Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies  to the financial statements).  

On
July 24, 2014, A M Acquisitions LLC, obtained a judgment against the Company, a director and former director for default of
the remainder of the Florida office lease through July 2016 in the amount of $181,968 including attorney s fees of $1,488
(see  Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies  to the financial statements). A full provision for this liability was recorded
in our financial statements during the year ended June 30, 2014.

as of August 13, 2015. As of June 30, 2016 there were 229 holders of our common stock and the closing price of our common stock
was $0.42 per share.  

The
Company did not effect any stock splits in fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016.    

DIVIDENDS   

The
Company does not expect to pay any dividends at this time. The payment of dividends, if any, will be contingent upon the Company s
revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any dividends will be within
the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and may be subject to restrictions under the terms of any debt or other
financing arrangements that the Company may enter into in the future. The Company presently intends to retain all earnings, if
any, for use in the Company s business operations and accordingly, the Board does not anticipate declaring any dividends
in the foreseeable future.

OVERVIEW   

As a development stage food and beverage company
we have been primarily engaged in developing our infrastructure and product portfolio. We  determined
during the first quarter of 2015 that we would transition out of our lower margin, perishable snack food product lines and have
focused our resources solely on developing our new healthy beverages. Amaize Beverage Corporation will continue to focus on developing
its healthy beverage product line with a plan to sell to large retailers and club stores in the United States. The Company recently
completed development of a unique  better for you  beverage with purple corn as its primary ingredient. The launch
of these beverages is subject to the Company s ability to obtain the necessary funding.  

Significant
Accounting Policies    

For
the Company s significant accounting policies see   Footnote 2   to the accompanying June 30, 2016 audited
financial statements.  

Presentation    

Net
sales,   reflect distribution allowances, handling and shipping income, represent what we collect and recognize as net
revenues in our financial statements.  

Our
  gross profit   consists of net sales less   cost of sales,   which represents the prices we
pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products as well as costs related to product shipments to our warehouse
and distribution center, duties and tariffs, expenses relating to shipment of products to customers and importers and similar
expenses.  

Selling
fees   consist of commissions, overrides and production bonuses.  

Our
  operating margins   consist of net sales, less cost of sales and selling fees.  

General
and administrative expenses   represent our operating expenses, components of which include labor and benefits, sales
and marketing events, professional fees, travel and entertainment, marketing, occupancy costs, communication costs, bank fees,
depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous operating expenses.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Our
results of operations for the periods below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods, which
depend on numerous factors, including our ability to distribute our products through major retailers, open new markets, penetrate
existing markets, and our ability to secure, develop and introduce new products.  

For
the Year Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2015   

Revenue    

The
Company revised its sales method from a network marketing model using individual brand partners as distributors, to direct to
consumer and retail store sales at the end of its fiscal year June 30, 2013. During this transition period the Company recognized
no revenues in the years ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Cost
of Revenues    

The
Company recognized no cost of sales in the years ended June 30, 2016 or 2015 as it recognized no sales during these periods.  

Gross
Profit    

The
Company recognized no gross profit in the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 due to the factors described above.  

Selling
Expenses    

The
Company incurred no selling expenses in the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

General
and Administrative Expenses    

General
and administrative expenses comprised the following for the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional advisor fees, audit fees, technology and product development. Our
general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $64,484 less than for the year ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in directors  fees, professional fees, travel and entertainment, office
expenses and rent, offset by increases in technology and product development.  

Settlement
of Liabilities with Equity    

During
the year ended June 30, 2015 the Company issued 3,178,650 shares of common stock valued at $1,589,325 in settlement of loans payable
to a related party of $127,146 resulting in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities of $1,462,179.  

During
the year ended June 30, 2016 the Company issued 25,000 shares of common stock valued at $25,000 in settlement of loans payable
to a related party of $8,575 resulting in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities $16,125. During the year ended June 30,
2016 the Company issued 476,461 restricted shares of common stock in payment of directors  fees in the amount of $162,000.  

Provision
for Income Taxes    

We
incurred taxable losses; consequently, no liability for taxation was incurred during the years ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Net
Loss    

The
net loss for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $1,657,286 as compared to $3,368,585 for the year ended June 30, 2015.  

  The
variances between the periods primarily arose due to the non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities described above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

The
Company had a cash balance of $0 at June 30, 2016 and a working capital deficit as follows:  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital
and to successfully implement its business plan. Management believes that the actions presently being taken and the success of
future operations may be sufficient to enable the Company to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that
the raising of equity will be successful. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding could have a material adverse effect on
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Cash
Flows    

The
following table summarizes selected items from our  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  for the years ended
June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.  

During
the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s operating expenses in the amounts of $27,001 and $65,536were paid
on its behalf by a shareholder. Accordingly, there was no movement in the Company s own bank account during the year ended
June 30, 2014 and only a nominal movement of $2,001 in the Company s merchant account used to pay expenses.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

At
June 30, 2016 the Company had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.  

ITEM
7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10 (f) (1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing
scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this item.

 Los Angeles, California 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Amaize Beverage Corp. (formerly Snackhealthy Inc) as of June 30, 2015 and the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders  deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Amaize Beverage Corp.
(formerly SnackHealthy, Inc.) of June 30, 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements
the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a working capital deficit that raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements, the Company has suffered losses and has not yet established a reliable, consistent and proven source of revenue to

plan. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

Note
1. The Company     

On
October 4, 2013, Healthient, Inc. ( the Company ) changed its name to SnackHealthy, Inc. and dissolved its sole wholly-owned
subsidiary SnackHealthy, Inc., a Nevada corporation. As of June 26, 2015, a majority of the shareholders of the Company representing
not less than 9,327,859 shares of common stock (82.83%) consented in writing to change the Company s name to Amaize Beverage
Corporation. Such approval and consent constitute the approval and consent of a majority of the total number of shares of outstanding
common stock and are sufficient under the Nevada General Corporation Law and the Company s Bylaws to approve the above action.
On August 13, 2015, Amaize Beverage Corporation, previously known as SnackHealthy, Inc., a Nevada corporation filed an amendment
to its articles of incorporation (the  Amendment ) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment
provided for the change of the Company s name from SnackHealthy, Inc., to Amaize Beverage Corporation. The name change and
the change of the Company s trading symbol were subsequently declared effective by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
as of August 19, 2015.  

The
Company has developed a healthy beverage product line containing a unique strain of purple corn which is high in antioxidant value.
The beverages are all natural, low calorie, gluten free, and non-GMO. The Company plans to distribute and sell the beverages through
large retailers and club stores in the United States.  

Note.
2 Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation   

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company s year-end is June 30.  

Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.  

Financial
Instruments   

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and amounts due to related parties, as reported in the accompanying balance sheets, approximates fair value due to the
short term nature of these financial instruments.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is three
to seven years.  

Website
Development Costs   

The
Company has adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350  Intangible-Goodwill and Other.  Costs
incurred in the planning state of websites are expensed, while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized
over the estimated three-year life of the asset. All website development costs have been fully amortized at June 30, 2016.  

Other
Assets   

Our
drink license was amortized over three years and is fully amortized at June 30, 2016.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

In
accordance with ASC 350, the Company regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence
of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that may suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack
of recoverability, an impairment loss is recognized by the Company if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair
value.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ) Income Taxes. Under ASC
740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped,
which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collectability of the amount is reasonably assured. Specifically,
revenue is recognized when products are shipped, which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The Company classifies
selling discounts and rebates, if any, as a reduction of revenue.  

Advertising
Costs   

The
Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred no advertising expenses
during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation .
Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based
compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period
during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted
share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost
is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting
periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively.  

Equity
instruments ( instruments ) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments,
as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505,  Equity Based
Payments to Non-Employees  defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement
date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance
is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based
on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share   

Net
loss per common share is computed pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed in the same way as for basic net loss.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
amounts previously presented for prior year have been reclassified. The reclassifications had no effect on net loss, total assets,
or stockholders  deficit.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.  

Note
3. Going Concern    

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which assumes the Company will
be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company
incurred a net loss of $1,657,286 for the year ended June 30, 2016 and accumulated losses of $553,109,195 since inception to June
30, 2016. Cash used in operations for the year ended June 30, 2016 approximated $29,000 and as of June 30, 2016, we had a working
capital deficit of $620,218. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its
business plan.  

Management
believes that the actions presently being taken and the success of future operations will be sufficient to enable the Company
to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that the raising of equity will be successful or that the Company
will be able to achieve profitability. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding or establish profitable operations would have
a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Note
4. Property and Equipment    

The
Company started the construction of several websites all of which have been completed and are being amortized over three years.
Computers and furniture are being depreciated over three to seven years.  

Property
and equipment were as follows:  

Note
5. Commitments and Contingencies    

Lease
Commitments   

The
Company gave up its leased office space in Jupiter, Florida in January 2014, and acquired a new office in Newport Beach, California.
The Florida leaseholder obtained a judgment in the amount of $181,968 for the remainder of the monthly lease payments through
June 2016 pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement plus legal fees of $1,487. The Company has recorded the full amount of
the judgment, however believes that when the facility is re-leased it may not have to pay the full amount. Upon the leaseholder s
execution of a new lease with a new tenant, the Company plans to file for the release of the amount of the judgment over and above
the actual loss incurred by the leaseholder. There is no guarantee the property will be re-leased or that such a filing will be
successful and that the Company will be able to mitigate its loss in this way.  

In
January 2014, the Company entered into a lease at the rate of $1,439 per month which ended December 2014. In January 2015, the
Company was equipped to operate in a virtual environment. We believe that our existing arrangement which provides for virtual
pbx telephone,   la carte conference space, address services, mail forwarding and hosting facilities to be highly cost
effective and adequate to meet our current needs. The Company plans to seek suitable additional space when needed.  

The
Company has not invested in any real property at this time, nor does the Company intend to do so. The Company has no formal policy
with respect to investments in real estate or investments with persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.  

Legal   

In
June of 2013, a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its President and directors alleging several
counts, including a breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and seeking damages in the amount of $122,300 and other unspecified
damages. On March 20, 2015 the court entered a final judgment in the amount of $200,761 comprised of the principal amount of $122,344
plus prejudgment interest from September 15, 2012 through the date of judgment in the amount of $54,421, costs in the amount of
$773, and attorney s fees of $23,222. The court dismissed the case against any party not listed in the final order and the
case is now closed as to all parties. As of March 31, 2015 the Company had accrued in full for this liability of $200,761 in its
financial statements.  

Note
6. Stockholders  Deficit    

The
Company has authorized 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock
with a par value of $0.001.  

During
the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company issued 115,000 shares of common stock for services valued at $199,250 and 2,500,000
shares of common stock for services to a related party valued at $1,250,000. Shareholder loans from a related party in the amount
of $127,146 were settled by the issuance of 3,178,650 shares of common stock resulting in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities
of $1,462,179.  

During
the year ended June 30, 2016 the Company issued 3,683,039 shares of common stock valued at $1,438,483 for services rendered by
related parties, 112,500 shares of common for services valued at $112,500, 476,461 shares of common stock in payment of Directors 
fees valued at $162,000 and 25,000 shares of common stock in payment of an account payable to a related party valued at $25,000
resulting in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities of $16,125.  

Non-Employee
Stock Options and Warrants   

The
Company accounts for non-employee stock options and warrants under ASC 718, whereby option and warrant costs are recorded based
on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. Unless otherwise provided for, the Company covers option and warrant exercises by issuing new shares.  

There
were no warrants or stock options issued or outstanding during the years ended June 30, 2016 or 2015. All warrants issued in prior
periods expired without being exercised.  

Note
8. Loans from Directors and Shareholders    

During
the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company issued 3,178,650 shares of common stock valued at $1,589,325 to a related party in settlement
of shareholder loans of $127,146 resulting in a non-cash loss of $1,462,179 on settlement of liabilities with equity.  

During
the year ended June 30, 2016 a related party advanced the Company loans in the amount of $20,506. As of June 30, 2016 the balance
of loans outstanding was $50,028. The loans are non-interest bearing and due on demand.  

Share
valuations are determined by the closing quoted share price of the stock on the date the issuance is authorized by the Board of
Directors.  

Note
9. Income Taxes    

The
components of the deferred tax asset are as follows:  

The
Company had available approximately $50,975,000 at June 30, 2016 and $49,300,000 at June 30, 2015 of unused federal and
Florida net operating loss carry-forwards that may be applied against future taxable income. These net operating loss carry-forwards
expire through 2033. There is no assurance that the Company will realize the benefit of the net operating loss carry-forwards.
ASC No. 740 requires a valuation allowance to be recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.  

Reconciliation
of the differences between the statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate is as follows at June 30, 2016 and June 30,
2015 respectively:  

Statutory rate    
        15  %  
 
     State taxes, net of federal tax benefit    
        5  %  
 
     Effective tax rate    
        20  %

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

A
system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-l5(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934,as amended [the  Exchange Act ]) are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Moreover, over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company,
and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures
required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15 (f), due to certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting as discussed below.  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting
for the Company. Due to limited resources, Management conducted an evaluation of internal controls based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
The results of this evaluation determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of June 30, 2016,
due to material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined as a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our
financial reporting.  

Management s
assessment identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting:  

The
    small size of our Company limits our ability to achieve the desired level of separation of internal controls and financial
    reporting. We currently do not have independent directors on our Board of Directors to review and oversee the financial policies
    and procedures of the Company.   

We
    do not have a functional audit committee since our Board of Directors acts as the audit committee.   

We
    have not achieved the desired level of documentation of our internal controls and procedures. When the Company obtains sufficient
    funding, this documentation will be strengthened through utilizing a third party consulting firm to assist management with
    its internal control documentation and further help to limit the possibility of any lapse in controls occurring.   

As
a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management
has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based
on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. To date, the Company has not been able to establish
an Audit Committee with an independent director due its limited financial resources. When the Company obtains sufficient funding,
Management intends to add establish its Audit Committee and charge them with assisting the Company in addressing the material
weaknesses noted above. The Company s lack of current financial resources makes it impossible for the Company to hire the
appropriate personnel needed to overcome these weaknesses and ensure that appropriate controls and separation of responsibilities
of a larger organization exist. We also will continue to follow the standards for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) for internal control over financial reporting to include procedures that:  

Pertain
    to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail accurately that fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    Company s assets;   

Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and the Board of Directors; and   

Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our
management determined that there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year
2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this annual report.
