[1] SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  NATURE OF OPERATION 
  TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. (   we ,  us ,  our  or   the  Company ) is a registered bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  The Company has   three   wholly-owned subsidiaries:  TriState Capital Bank (the  Bank ), a Pennsylvania-chartered state bank; Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC ( Chartwell ), a registered investment advisor; and Chartwell TSC Securities Corp. ( CTSC Securities ), which is applying to be registered as a broker/dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ). 
    
  The Bank was established to serve the commercial banking and private banking needs of middle-market businesses and high-net-worth individuals.  Chartwell provides investment management services to institutional, sub-advisory, and separately managed account clients and had assets under management of   $10.80 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .  CTSC Securities has a primary business of facilitating distribution and marketing efforts for the proprietary investment products provided by Chartwell, including shares of mutual funds advised and/or administered by Chartwell and private funds advised and/or administered by Chartwell. 
    
  Regulatory approval was received and the Bank commenced operations on January 22, 2007.  The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and the Federal Reserve.  Chartwell is a registered investment advisor regulated by the SEC.  Chartwell was established through the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Chartwell Investment Partners, LP that was effective March 5, 2014.  CTSC Securities was capitalized in May 2014, and once registered, will be a broker/dealer regulated by the SEC and FINRA. 
    
  The Bank conducts business through its main office located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as its   four   additional representative offices in Cleveland, Ohio; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Edison, New Jersey; and New York, New York.  Chartwell conducts business through its office located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania and CTSC Securities will conduct business through its office located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
    
  USE OF ESTIMATES 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of related revenue and expense during the reporting period.  Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than those anticipated in the estimates, which could materially affect the financial results of our operations and financial condition. 
    
  The material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets and its evaluation for impairment, and deferred income taxes and its related recoverability, which are discussed later in this section. 
    
  CONSOLIDATION 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank, Chartwell and CTSC Securities, after elimination of inter-company accounts and transactions.  The accounts of the Bank, in turn, include its wholly-owned subsidiary, Meadowood Asset Management, LLC, after elimination of inter-company accounts and transactions.  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company presented herein have been prepared pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for quarterly reports on form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by GAAP for a full year presentation.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) and disclosures, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, have been included.  Interim results are not necessarily reflective of the results of the entire year.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   February 16, 2016  . 
    
  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
  For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company has defined cash and cash equivalents as cash, interest-earning deposits with other institutions, federal funds sold, and short-term investments that have an original maturity of   90   days or less.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
  The Company s investments are classified as either:  (1) held-to-maturity   debt securities that the Company intends to hold until maturity and are reported at amortized cost; (2) trading securities   debt and certain equity securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; or (3) available-for-sale   debt and certain equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), on an after-tax basis. 
    
  The cost of securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis.  Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded as interest income from investments over the life of the security utilizing the level yield method.  We evaluate impaired investment securities quarterly to determine if impairments are temporary or other-than-temporary.  For impaired debt and equity securities, management first determines whether it intends to sell or if it is more-likely than not that it will be required to sell the impaired securities.  This determination considers current and forecasted liquidity requirements, regulatory and capital requirements and securities portfolio management.  If the Company intends to sell a security with a fair value below amortized cost or if it is more-likely than not that it will be required to sell such a security before recovery, an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) charge is recorded through current period earnings for the full decline in fair value below amortized cost.  For debt and equity securities that the Company does not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell before recovery, an OTTI charge is recorded through current period earnings for the amount of the valuation decline below amortized cost that is attributable to credit losses.  The remaining difference between the security s fair value and amortized cost (that is, the decline in fair value not attributable to credit losses) is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the shareholders  equity section of the consolidated statements of financial condition, on an after-tax basis. 
    
  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK 
  The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ).  Member institutions are required to invest in FHLB stock.  The stock is carried at cost, which approximates its liquidation value, and it is evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value.  The following matters are considered by management when evaluating the FHLB stock for impairment:  the ability of the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the FHLB; the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the institution and its customer base; and the Company s intent and ability to hold its FHLB stock for the foreseeable future.  Management believes the Company s holdings in the FHLB stock are recoverable at par value, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income, in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  LOANS 
  Loans and leases held-for investment are stated at unpaid principal balances, net of deferred loan fees and costs.  Loans held-for-sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value.  Interest income on loans is accrued at the contractual rate on the principal amount outstanding and includes the amortization of deferred loan fees and costs.  Deferred loan fees and costs are amortized to interest income over the life of the loan, taking into consideration scheduled payments and prepayments. 
    
  The Company considers a loan to be a Troubled Debt Restructuring ( TDR ) when there is a concession made to a financially troubled borrower without adequate consideration provided to the Company.  Once a loan is deemed to be a TDR, the Company considers whether the loan should be placed in non-accrual status.  In assessing accrual status, the Company considers the likelihood that repayment and performance according to the original contractual terms will be achieved, as well as the borrower s historical payment performance.  A loan is designated and reported as TDR until such loan is either paid-off or sold, unless the restructuring agreement specifies an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate that would be accepted at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk and it is fully expected that the remaining principal and interest will be collected according to the restructured agreement. 
    
  The recognition of interest income on a loan is discontinued when, in management s opinion, it is probable the borrower is unable to meet payments as they become due or when the loan becomes   90   days past due, whichever occurs first.  All accrued and unpaid interest on such loans is reversed.  Such interest ultimately collected is applied to reduce principal if there is doubt about the collectability of principal.  If a borrower brings a loan current for which accrued interest has been reversed, then the recognition of interest income on the loan is resumed, once the loan has been current for a period of   six   consecutive months or greater. 
    
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk (commitments to extend credit) in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses (i.e. demand loans) and may require payment of a fee.  Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the unfunded commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis using the same credit policies in making commitments and  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of a commitment, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 
    
  OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED  
  Real estate owned, other than bank premises, is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs.  Fair value is determined based on an independent appraisal.  Expenses related to holding the property are charged against earnings when incurred.  Depreciation is not recorded on the other real estate owned ( OREO ) properties. 
    
  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
  The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses that are charged to operations.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the principal is uncollectible.  If, at a later time, amounts are recovered with respect to loans previously charged off, the recovered amount is credited to the allowance for loan losses. 
    
  The allowance is appropriate, in management s judgment, to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Management s judgment takes into consideration general economic conditions, diversification and seasoning of the loan portfolio, historic loss experience, identified credit problems, delinquency levels and adequacy of collateral.  Although management believes it has used the best information available to it in making such determinations, and that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary, and net income may be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the level of the allowance.  In addition, as an integral part of their periodic examination, certain regulatory agencies review the adequacy of the Bank s allowance for loan losses and may direct the Bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
    
  The components of the allowance for loan losses represent estimates based upon Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 450,   Contingencies,   and ASC Topic 310,   Receivables  .  ASC Topic 450 applies to homogeneous loan pools such as consumer installment, residential mortgages, consumer lines of credit and commercial loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment under ASC Topic 310.  ASC Topic 310 is applied to commercial and consumer loans that are individually evaluated for impairment. 
    
  Under ASC Topic 310, a loan is impaired, based upon current information and events, in management s opinion, when it is probable that the loan will not be repaid according to its original contractual terms, including both principal and interest, or if a loan is designated as a TDR.  Management performs individual assessments of impaired loans to determine the existence of loss exposure based upon a discounted cash flows method or where a loan is collateral dependent, based upon the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. 
    
  In estimating probable loan loss under ASC Topic 450 management considers numerous factors, including historical charge-offs and subsequent recoveries.  Management also considers, but is not limited to, qualitative factors that influence our credit quality, such as delinquency and non-performing loan trends, changes in loan underwriting guidelines and credit policies, as well as the results of internal loan reviews.  Finally, management considers the impact of changes in current local and regional economic conditions in the markets that we serve.  Assessment of relevant economic factors indicates that some of the Company s primary markets historically tend to lag the national economy, with local economies in our primary market areas also improving or weakening, as the case may be, but at a more measured rate than the national trends. 
    
  Management bases the computation of the allowance for loan losses under ASC Topic 450 on two factors:  the primary factor and the secondary factor.  The primary factor is based on the inherent risk identified by management within each of the Company s   three   loan portfolios based on the historical loss experience of each loan portfolio and the loss emergence period.  Management has developed a methodology that is applied to each of the   three   primary loan portfolios, consisting of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and private banking.  As the loan loss history, mix and risk ratings of each loan portfolio change, the primary factor adjusts accordingly.  The allowance for loan losses related to the primary factor is based on our estimates as to probable losses for each loan portfolio.  The secondary factor is intended to capture risks related to events and circumstances that management believes have an impact on the performance of the loan portfolio.  Although this factor is more subjective in nature, the methodology focuses on internal and external trends in pre-specified categories (risk factors) and applies a quantitative percentage that drives the secondary factor.  There are nine risk factors and each risk factor is assigned a reserve level based on management s judgment as to the probable impact of each risk factor on each loan portfolio and is monitored on a quarterly basis.  As the trend in any risk factor changes, a corresponding change occurs in the reserve associated with each respective risk factor, such that the secondary factor remains current to changes in each loan portfolio. 
    
  The Company also maintains a reserve for losses on unfunded commitments.  This reserve is reflected as a component of other liabilities and, in management s judgment, is sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in the commitments.  Management tracks the level and trends in unused commitments and takes into consideration the same factors as those considered for purposes of the allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES 
  The Company recognizes investment management fee revenue when the advisory services are performed.  Fees are based on assets under management and are calculated pursuant to individual client contracts.  Investment management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis.  In a limited number of cases, the Company may earn a performance fee based on investment performance achieved versus a stated benchmark.  Performance fees are included in investment management fee revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Investment management fees receivable represent amounts due for contractual investment management services provided to the Company s clients, primarily institutional investors, mutual funds and individual investors.  Management performs credit evaluations of its customers  financial condition when it is deemed to be necessary, and does not require collateral.  The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on specifically identified receivables.  Investment management fees receivable are considered delinquent when payment is not received within contractual terms and are charged off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts when management determines that recovery is unlikely and the Company ceases its collection efforts.  There was   no   bad debt expense recorded for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and there was   no   allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
  The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.  Under this method of accounting, the acquired company s net assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition, and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with our results from that date forward.  Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.  The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired (including identified intangibles) is recorded as goodwill.  The change in the initial estimate of any contingent earnout amounts is reflected in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to at least annual assessments for impairment by applying a fair value based test.  The Company reviews goodwill annually and again at any quarter-end if a material event occurs during the quarter that may affect goodwill.  If goodwill testing is required, an assessment of qualitative factors can be completed before performing the two step goodwill impairment test.  If an assessment of qualitative factors determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the two step goodwill impairment test is not required.  Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment by determining if our fair value has fallen below carrying value. 
    
  Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights.  Other intangible assets that have finite lives, such as trade name, certain client relationships and non-compete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  These finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from   four   to   twenty-five   years.  Other intangible assets that have indefinite lives, such as certain client relationships, are not amortized.  All other intangibles are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
    
  OFFICE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT 
  Office properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, except for leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.  Estimated useful lives are dependent upon the nature and condition of the asset and range from   three   to   ten   years.  Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements that extend the useful life are capitalized and depreciated to operating expense over the estimated remaining life of the asset.  When the Bank receives an allowance for improvements to be made to one of its leased offices, we record the allowance as a deferred liability and recognize it as a reduction to rent expense over the life of the related lease. 
    
  BANK OWNED LIFE INSURANCE 
  Bank owned life insurance ( BOLI ) policies on certain officers and employees are recorded at net cash surrender value on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  Upon termination of the BOLI policy the Company receives the cash surrender value.  BOLI benefits are payable to the Company upon death of the insured.  Changes in net cash surrender value are recognized as non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  DEPOSITS 
  Deposits are stated at principal outstanding and interest on deposits is accrued and charged to interest expense daily and is paid or credited in accordance with the terms of the respective accounts.

     Table of Contents  

BORROWINGS 
  The Company records FHLB advances and subordinated notes payable at their principal amount net of debt issuance costs, per ASU 2015-03.  Interest expense is recognized based on the coupon rate of the obligations.  Costs associated with the acquisition of subordinated notes payable are amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the borrowing. 
    
  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
  Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding non-vested restricted stock.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards granted utilizing the treasury stock method. 
    
  INCOME TAXES 
  The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities with regard to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Management assesses all available evidence to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized.  The available evidence used in connection with the assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected taxable income, potential tax planning strategies and projected reversals of deferred tax items.  These assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo significant change.  Changes to the evidence used in the assessments could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations in the period in which they occur.  It is the Company s policy to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
  The Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  .  All derivatives are evaluated at inception as to whether or not they are hedging or non-hedging activities, and appropriate documentation is maintained to support the final determination.  All derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition and measured at fair value.  For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.  Any hedge ineffectiveness would be recognized in the income statement line item pertaining to the hedged item.  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the effective portion of the cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  When the cash flows associated with the hedged item are realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.  The Company also has interest derivative positions that are not designated as hedging instruments.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings.   
    
  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date, using assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.  An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale.  Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance provides a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories: 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 
       
  Fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances, on a non-recurring basis. 
    
  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards based on estimated fair values, for all share-based awards, including stock options and restricted shares, made to employees and directors. 
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  .  As a result, compensation cost for all share-based payments is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC Topic 718.  The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is included in stock-based employee compensation cost in the consolidated statements of income and recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital, for equity-based awards.  Compensation expense for all awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire grant. 
    
  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
  Unrealized holding gains (losses) and the non-credit component of losses on the Company s investment securities available-for-sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes.  Also included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is the remaining unamortized balance of the unrealized holding gains (non-credit losses), net of applicable income taxes, that existed on the transfer date for investment securities reclassified into the held-to-maturity category from the available-for-sale category. 
    
  Unrealized holding gains (losses) on the effective portion of the Company s cash flow hedge derivatives are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes, which will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s debt. 
    
  TREASURY STOCK 
  The repurchase of the Company s common stock is recorded at cost.  At the time of reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced using the average cost method.  Gains and losses on the reissuance of common stock are recorded in additional paid-in capital, to the extent additional paid-in capital from any previous net gains on treasury share transactions exists.  Any net deficiency is charged to retained earnings. 
    
  RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
  In September of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,    which addresses eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows.  The eight classification issues are as follows:  debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon bonds; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  This ASU is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  If an entity early adopts the ASU in an interim period, adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.  An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  Entities should apply this ASU using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  If it is impracticable for an entity to apply the ASU retrospectively for some of the issues, it may apply the amendments for those issues prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,    Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ,  which significantly changes the way entities recognize impairment of many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over their remaining life.  The changes are effective for public business entities that are SEC filers, for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  All entities may early adopt the standard for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,    which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s simplification initiative.  The ASU changes seven aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including:  (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes; (6) practical expedient - expected term (nonpublic only); and (7) intrinsic value (nonpublic only).  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public business entities.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period provided that the entire ASU is adopted.  Even if an entity early adopts the amendments after the first interim period, the adoption date is as of the beginning of the year for the issues adopted by the cumulative-effect and prospective methods.  Any adjustments to previously reported interim periods of that fiscal year should be included in the year-to-date results.  If those previously reported interim results appear in any future filings, they are reported on the revised basis.  The Company chose to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in September 2016, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,    Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments,    which clarifies that determining whether the economic characteristics of a put or call are   clearly and closely related   to its debt host requires only an assessment of the   four-step decision sequence   outlined in FASB ASC paragraph 815-15-25-24.  Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related.  ASU 2016-06 is effective for public business entities for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not been issued but would be retroactively applied to the beginning of the year that includes that interim period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,    Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,    which clarifies that a change in one of the parties to a derivative contract (through novation) that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require dedesignation of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  This ASU is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases,    which, among other things, requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet.  This will increase their reported assets and liabilities - in some cases very significantly.  Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP.  ASU 2016-02 supersedes Topic 840,   Leases  .  ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  This ASU mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,    which will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments, and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.  The ASU is effective for public business entities for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,    Business Combinations (Topic 805):  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments.     This ASU eliminated the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated.  The ASU was effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10,    Technical Correction and Improvements,    which, among other things, corrects the initial codification of FASB Statement No. 140,    Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (as Amended by FASB Statement No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets)  .   The initial codification inadvertently added the word  public  to paragraph 860-10-50-7, which was not in the original guidance.  The ASU also clarifies that the requirement relates to  involvement by others .  This amendment in ASU 2015-10 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of ASU 2015-10 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,    Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):  Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).     This ASU eliminated the requirement to categorize investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASB s fair value measurement guidance.  Reporting entities were required to adopt the ASU retrospectively.  The effective date for public business entities was fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,    Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.     This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs were not affected by the amendments in this update.  For public business entities, the amendments in this update were effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented was adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance.  Upon transition, an entity was required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle.  These disclosures included the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period

information that had been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability).  The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810):  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.     This ASU changed the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a variable interest entity (VIE), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.  It also eliminated the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities.  The new guidance excludes money market funds that are required to comply with Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and similar entities from the U.S. GAAP consolidation requirements.  The new consolidation guidance was effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  At the effective date, all previous consolidation analyses that the guidance affects was required to be reconsidered.  This included the consolidation analyses for all VIEs and for all limited partnerships and similar entities that previously were consolidated by the general partner even though the entities were not VIEs.  The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,    Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):  Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.     This ASU     eliminated the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP as part of its simplification initiative.  The ASU did not affect disclosure guidance for events or transactions that are unusual in nature or infrequent in their occurrence.  The ASU was effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  The ASU allowed prospective or retrospective application.  The effective date was the same for both public entities and all other entities.  The adoption of ASU 2015-01 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),    required an entity to determine the nature of the host contract by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share, including the embedded derivative feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting from the host contract when evaluating whether the host contract is more akin to debt or equity.  In evaluating the stated and implied substantive terms and features, the existence or omission of any single term or feature does not necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract.  Although an individual term or feature may weigh more heavily in the evaluation on the basis of facts and circumstances, an entity should use judgment based on an evaluation of all the relevant terms and features.  This ASU was effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The effects of initially adopting the amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendment is effective.  Retrospective application was permitted to all relevant prior periods.  The adoption of ASU 2014-16 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,    Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.     This ASU describes how an entity s management should assess whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  Management should consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in making its assessment.  If after considering management s plans, substantial doubt about an entity s going concern is alleviated, an entity shall disclose information in the footnotes that enables the users of the financial statements to understand the events that raised the going concern and how management s plan alleviated this concern.  If after considering management s plans, substantial doubt about an entity s going concern is not alleviated, the entity shall disclose in the footnotes indicating that a substantial doubt about the entity s going concern exists within one year of the date of the issued financial statements.  Additionally, the entity shall disclose the events that led to this going concern and management s plans to mitigate them.  The new standard applies to all entities for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,    Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performing Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.     This ASU requires a reporting entity to treat a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition.  A reporting entity should apply FASB ASC Topic 718,   Compensation-Stock Compensation  , to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting.  This update was effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, for all entities.  ASU 2014-12 may be adopted either prospectively for share-based payment awards granted or modified on or after the effective date, or retrospectively, using a modified retrospective approach.  The modified retrospective approach would apply to share-based payment awards outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements on

adoption, and to all new or modified awards thereafter.  The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).     This ASU implements a common revenue standard that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue.  The core principle of this update is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 establishes a five-step model that entities must follow to recognize revenue and removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing guidance.  Per ASU 2015-14, this update is effective for annual periods and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, for public business entities, certain employee benefit plans, and certain not-for-profit entities applying U.S. GAAP.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position.

[2] BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
    
  On April 29, 2016, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of The Killen Group, Inc. (the "TKG acquisition"), an investment management firm with approximately   $2.02 billion   in assets under management.  Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement substantially all of the assets of The Killen Group, Inc. ( TKG ) were acquired for a purchase price consisting of   $15.0 million   paid in cash at closing based on five-times a base EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of   $3.0 million   plus an earnout.  The earnout, while not limited under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, will be calculated based on a multiple of seven-times the incremental growth in TKG's annual run-rate EBITDA over   $3.0 million   at December 31, 2016.  The earnout was estimated, at closing, to be approximately   $3.7 million   based on the estimated annual run-rate EBITDA of TKG at December 31, 2016.  Any change to the earnout calculation from the estimated   $3.7 million   recorded at closing, will be recorded in the statement of income in the period in which it is deemed probable to occur.  The foregoing summary of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Asset Purchase Agreement, which was included as Exhibit 2.2 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2016, the terms of which Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. 
    
  The following table summarizes total consideration at closing, assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the TKG acquisition on April 29, 2016:

     Table of Contents  

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the estimated acquisition earnout was decreased by   $1.2 million   based on management s estimate of the projected annualized run-rate EBITDA of TKG at December 31, 2016.  This adjustment to the earnout was credited to non-interest expense during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  The acquisition earnout liability was   $2.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In connection with the TKG acquisition, total acquisition-related transaction costs incurred by TriState Capital were approximately   $601,000   during   2015   and   $1,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which were comprised primarily of legal, advisory and other costs. 
    
  Since the acquisition, the TKG acquired operations contributed revenues of   $4.6 million   and approximate earnings of   $818,000   (excluding the earnout adjustment as discussed above) which were included in the consolidated statement of income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Goodwill is not amortized for book purposes, but is deductible for tax purposes.  The following table shows the amount of other intangible assets acquired through the TKG acquisition on April 29, 2016, by class and estimated useful life. 

The following table presents unaudited pro forma financial information which combines the historical consolidated statements of income of the Company and The Killen Group, Inc. to give effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015, for the periods indicated.

The change in the fair values of our municipal bonds, agency collateralized mortgage obligation and agency mortgage-backed securities are primarily the result of interest rate fluctuations.  To assess for impairment on municipal bonds, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency collateralized loan obligations and certain equity securities, management evaluates the underlying issuer s financial performance and the related credit rating information through a review of publicly available financial statements and other publicly available information.  This review did not identify any issues related to the ultimate repayment of principal and interest on these securities.  In addition, the Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position until recovery of their amortized cost.  Based on this, the Company considers all of the unrealized losses to be temporary impairment losses.  Within the available-for-sale portfolio, there were   26   positions, aggregating to   $1.2 million   in unrealized losses that were temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   14   positions were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months totaling   $1.1 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   36   positions, aggregating to   $2.4 million   in unrealized losses that were temporarily impaired, of which   14   positions were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months totaling   $1.5 million  .  Within the held-to-maturity portfolio, there was   one   position, aggregating to   $10,000   in unrealized losses that was temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   no   positions were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months.  As of

December 31, 2015  , there were   six   positions, aggregating to   $85,000   in unrealized losses that were temporarily impaired, of which   no   positions were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months. 
    
  There were   no   investment securities classified as trading securities outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  There was   no   activity in investment securities classified as trading during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  There was   $9.2 million   and   $9.8 million   in FHLB stock outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  There were   $570,000   of net   redemptions   in FHLB stock during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $2.3 million   of net   purchases   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

[4] LOANS 
    
  The Company generates loans through the middle-market and private banking channels.  These channels provide risk diversification and offer significant growth opportunities.  The middle-market banking channel consists of our commercial and industrial ( C I ) and commercial real estate ( CRE ) loan portfolios that serve middle-market businesses and real estate developers.  The private banking channel includes loans secured by cash, marketable securities and other asset-based loans to executives, high-net-worth individuals, trusts and businesses, many of whom we source through referral relationships with independent broker/dealers, wealth managers, family offices, trust companies and other financial intermediaries. 
    
  Loans held-for-investment were comprised of the following: 

The Company s customers have unused loan commitments.  Often these commitments are not fully utilized and therefore the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The amount of unfunded commitments, including standby letters of credit, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $1.61 billion   and   $1.27 billion  , respectively.  The interest rate for each commitment is based on the prevailing market conditions at the time of funding.  The lending commitment maturities as of   September 30, 2016  , were as follows:    $1.32 billion   in one year or less;   $176.9 million   in one to three years; and   $117.6 million   in greater than three years.  The reserve for losses on unfunded commitments was   $697,000   and   $546,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which includes reserves for probable losses on unfunded loan commitments, including standby letters of credit and also risk participations. 
    
  Included in the unfunded commitment totals listed above, were loans in the process of origination totaling approximately   $53.5 million   and   $31.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which extend over varying periods of time. 
    
  The Company issues standby letters of credit in the normal course of business.  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party.  The Company would be required to perform under the standby letters of credit when drawn upon by the guaranteed party in the case of non-performance by the Company s customer.  Collateral may be obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer.  The amount of unfunded commitments related

     Table of Contents  

to standby letters of credit as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , included in the total listed above, was   $82.3 million   and   $89.9 million  , respectively.  Should the Company be obligated to perform under the standby letters of credit the Company will seek repayment from the customer for amounts paid.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $44.1 million   in standby letters of credit will expire within one year, while the remaining standby letters of credit will expire in periods greater than one year.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there was   one   draw on a standby letter of credit totaling   $100,000  , which was immediately repaid by the borrower.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   two   draws on a standby letters of credit totaling   $146,000  , which were immediately repaid by the borrower or converted to an outstanding loan based on the contractual terms.  Most of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The probable liability for losses on standby letters of credit was included in the reserve for losses on unfunded commitments. 
    
  The Company has entered into risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which we are a participant.  The risk participation agreements provide credit protection to the financial institution counterparties should the customers fail to perform on their interest rate derivative contracts.  The potential liability for outstanding obligations was included in the reserve for losses on unfunded commitments. 

[5] ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
    
  Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at a specific point in time.  This estimate includes losses associated with specifically identified loans, as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio.  Additions are made to the allowance through both periodic provisions charged to income and recoveries of losses previously incurred.  Reductions to the allowance occur as loans are charged off   or when the credit history of any of the   three   loan portfolios improves  .  Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance quarterly, and in doing so relies on various factors including, but not limited to, assessment of historical loss experience, delinquency and non-accrual trends, portfolio growth, underlying collateral coverage and current economic conditions.  This evaluation is subjective and requires material estimates that may change over time.  In addition, management evaluates the overall methodology for the allowance for loan losses on an annual basis.  The calculation of the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration the inherent risk identified within each of the Company s   three   primary loan portfolios, commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and private banking.  In addition, management takes into account the historical loss experience of each loan portfolio, to ensure that the resultant allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in such loan portfolios.  Refer to   Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , for more details on the Company s allowance for loan losses policy. 
    
  The following discusses key characteristics and risks within each primary loan portfolio: 
    
  Middle-Market Banking:  Commercial and Industrial Loans.    This loan portfolio primarily includes loans made to service companies or manufacturers generally for the purpose of production, operating capacity, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment financing, acquisitions and recapitalizations.  Cash flow from the borrower s operations is the primary source of repayment for these loans, except for certain commercial loans that are secured by cash and marketable securities. 
    
  The industry of the borrower is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the condition of the local/regional economy.  Collateral for these types of loans at times does not have sufficient value in a distressed or liquidation scenario to satisfy the outstanding debt.  Any C I loans collateralized by cash and marketable securities are treated the same as private banking loans for purposes of the allowance for loan loss calculation.  In addition, shared national credit loans that also involve a private equity sponsor are combined as a homogeneous group and evaluated separately based on the historical loss trend of such loans. 
    
  Middle-Market Banking:  Commercial Real Estate Loans.      This loan portfolio includes loans secured by commercial purpose real estate, including both owner occupied properties and investment properties for various purposes including office, retail, industrial, multifamily and hospitality.  Individual project cash flows, global cash flows and liquidity from the developer, or the sale of the property are the primary sources of repayment for these loans.  Also included are commercial construction loans to finance the construction or renovation of structures as well as to finance the acquisition and development of raw land for various purposes.  The increased level of risk of these loans is generally confined to the construction period.  If there are problems, the project may not be completed, and as such, may not provide sufficient cash flow on its own to service the debt or have sufficient value in a liquidation to cover the outstanding principal. 
    
  The underlying purpose/collateral of the loans is an important indicator of risk for this loan portfolio.  Additional risks exist and are dependent on several factors such as the condition of the local/regional economy, whether or not the project is owner occupied, the type of project, and the experience and resources of the developer. 
    
  Private Banking Loans.    Our private banking lending activities are conducted on a national basis.  This loan portfolio primarily includes loans made to high-net-worth individuals, trusts and businesses that are typically secured by cash and marketable securities.  Some loans are secured by residential real estate or other financial assets.  The portfolio also has lines of credit and unsecured loans.  The primary sources of repayment for these loans are the income and/or assets of the borrower. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

The underlying collateral is the most important indicator of risk for this loan portfolio.  The overall lower risk profile of this portfolio is driven by loans secured by cash and marketable securities, which was   90.5%   and   87.8%   of total private banking loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Management further assesses risk within each loan portfolio using key inherent risk differentiators.  The components of the allowance for loan losses represent estimates based upon ASC Topic 450,   Contingencies,   and ASC Topic 310,   Receivables.    ASC Topic 450 applies to homogeneous loan pools such as consumer installment, residential mortgages and consumer lines of credit, as well as commercial loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment under ASC Topic 310.  Impaired loans are individually evaluated for impairment under ASC Topic 310. 
    
  On a monthly basis, management monitors various credit quality indicators for both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios, including delinquency, non-performing status, changes in risk ratings, changes in the underlying performance of the borrowers and other relevant factors.  On a daily basis, the Company monitors the collateral of margin loans secured by cash and marketable securities within the private banking portfolio, which further reduces the risk profile of that portfolio.  Refer to   Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , for the Company s policy for determining past due status of loans. 
    
  Management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its internal risk rating system.  Loan risk ratings are assigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower and, for our loans secured by marketable securities, the quality of the collateral.  Loan risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to internal policies.  Loans within the pass rating are believed to have a lower risk of loss than loans risk rated as special mention, substandard and doubtful, which are believed to have an increasing risk of loss. 
    
  The Company s risk ratings are consistent with regulatory guidance and are as follows: 
    
  Pass     The loan is currently performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
    
  Special Mention     A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that warrant management s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or in our credit position at some future date.  Economic and market conditions, beyond the customer s control, may in the future necessitate this classification. 
    
  Substandard     A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any.  Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
    
  Doubtful     A doubtful loan has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan categorized as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Non-Performing and Impaired Loans 
    
  Management monitors the delinquency status of the loan portfolio on a monthly basis.  Loans were considered non-performing when interest and principal were   90   days or more past due or management has determined that it is probable the borrower is unable to meet payments as they become due.  The risk of loss is generally highest for non-performing loans. 
    
  Management determines loans to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the loan will not be repaid according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including both principal and interest, or if a loan is designated as a TDR.  Refer to   Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , for the Company s policy on evaluating loans for impairment and interest income. 
    
  The following tables present the Company s investment in loans considered to be impaired and related information on those impaired loans:

     Table of Contents  

Impaired loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were   $21.2 million   and   $17.2 million  , respectively.  There was   no   interest income recognized on these loans, while on non-accrual status, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and the twelve months ended December 31,   2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest income. 
    
  Impaired loans were evaluated using a discounted cash flow method or based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs.  Based on those evaluations, as of   September 30, 2016  , there were specific reserves totaling   $7.9 million  , which were included in the   $20.2 million   allowance for loan losses.  Also included in impaired loans was   one   C I loan with a balance of   $489,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , with   no   corresponding specific reserve since this loan had a net realizable value that management believes will be recovered from the borrower. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were specific reserves totaling   $4.5 million  , which were included in the   $18.0 million   allowance for loan losses.  Also included in impaired loans were   three   C I loans,   one   CRE loans and   two   private banking loans with a combined balance of   $4.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , with   no   corresponding specific reserve since these loans had a net realizable value that management believes will be recovered from the borrower.

  The following table provides additional information on the Company s loans designated as troubled debt restructurings: 

Of the non-accrual loans as of   September 30, 2016  ,   three   C I loans were designated by the Company as TDRs.  There was also   one   C I loan that was still accruing interest and designated by the Company as a performing TDR as of   September 30, 2016  .  The aggregate recorded investment of these loans was   $16.7 million  .  There were unused commitments of   $7,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , which was related to the performing TDR. 
    
  Of the non-accrual loans as of   December 31, 2015  ,   five   C I loans and   one   residential mortgage loan were designated by the Company as TDRs.

There were unused commitments of   $1.7 million   on these loans as of   December 31, 2015  , of which   $39,000   was related to the performing TDR. 
    
  The modifications made to restructured loans typically consist of an extension or reduction of the payment terms, or the deferral of principal payments.  There were   no   loans modified as a TDR within twelve months of the corresponding balance sheet date with a payment default during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  There were   two   loans totaling   $4.0 million   that were modified as a TDR within twelve months of the corresponding balance sheet date with a payment default during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , that were already on non-accrual status and fully secured or adequately reserved as of   September 30, 2015  .

[8] BORROWINGS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , borrowings were comprised of the following: 

The Bank s FHLB borrowing capacity is based on the collateral value of certain securities held in safekeeping at the FHLB and loans pledged to the FHLB.  The Bank submits a quarterly Qualified Collateral Report ( QCR ) to the FHLB to update the value of the loans pledged.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s borrowing capacity is based on the information provided in the   June 30, 2016  , QCR filing.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had securities held in safekeeping at the FHLB with a fair value of   $5.4 million  , combined with pledged loans of   $846.2 million  , for a borrowing capacity of   $605.6 million  , of which   $205.0 million   was outstanding in advances, as reflected in the table above.  As of   December 31, 2015  , there was   $220.0 million   outstanding in advances from the FHLB.  When the Bank borrows from the FHLB, interest is charged at the FHLB s posted rates at the time of the borrowing. 
    
  The Bank maintains an unsecured line of credit of   $10.0 million   with M T Bank and an unsecured line of credit of   $20.0 million   with Texas Capital Bank.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the full amount of these established lines were available to the Bank. 
    
  The Holding Company established an unsecured line of credit of   $25.0 million  , effective December 29, 2015, with Texas Capital Bank.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the full amount of this established line was available.

In June 2014, the Company completed a private placement of subordinated notes payable, raising   $35.0 million  .  The subordinated notes have a term of   5   years at a fixed rate of   5.75%  .  The proceeds qualified as Tier 2 capital for the holding company, under federal regulatory capital rules. 

[9] REGULATORY CAPITAL 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory   and possibly additional discretionary   actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s and the Bank s financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s and the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Company s and the Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the tables below) of Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET 1 ), Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined).  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. and TriState Capital Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
    
  Financial depository institutions are categorized as well capitalized if they meet minimum Total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, CET 1 risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) as set forth in the tables below.  Based upon the information in the most recently filed Call Report, the Bank exceeded the capital ratios necessary to be well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  There have been no conditions or events since the filing of the most recent Call Report that management believes have changed the Bank s capital, as presented below. 
    
  In December 2010, the Basel Committee released a final framework for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III.  In July 2013, final rules implementing the Basel III capital accord were adopted by the federal banking agencies.  Basel III, which began phasing in on January 1, 2015, has replaced the existing regulatory capital rules for the Company and the Bank.  The Basel III final rules required new minimum capital ratio standards, established a new common equity tier 1 to total risk-weighted assets ratio, subjected banking organizations to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, and established a new standardized approach for risk weightings. 
    
  The following tables set forth certain information concerning the Company s and the Bank s regulatory capital as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

In addition, the final rules subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization does not maintain a capital conservation buffer of risk-based capital ratios in an amount greater than   2.5%   of its total risk-weighted assets.  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at   0.625%   and will be phased in over a   four  -year period (increasing by that amount ratably on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches   2.5%   on January 1, 2019). 
    
  The Company has not paid dividends to its holders of its common shares since its inception in 2007. 

[10] EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The Company participates in a qualified 401(k) defined contribution plan, under which eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their salary at their discretion.

[11] STOCK TRANSACTIONS 
    
  In October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $10 million  , or up to   1,000,000   shares, of the Company s common stock through December 31, 2015.  Under this plan, the Company repurchased a total of   1,000,000   shares for approximately   $9.9 million  , at an average cost of   $9.90   per share, which are held as treasury stock. 
    
  In January 2016, the Board of Directors authorized another repurchase of up to   $10 million  , or up to   1,000,000   shares, of the Company s common stock.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased a total of   334,275   shares for approximately   $4.3 million  , at an average cost of   $12.89   per share, which are held as treasury stock.  The Board subsequently authorized the Company to utilize some of the   $10 million   allocated to this share repurchase program to cancel options granted by the Company to purchase shares of its common stock that expire in 2017.  In accordance with that authorization, in addition to the shares purchased as described in this paragraph, the Company and holders of options that expire in 2017 agreed to cancel options as set forth in the following paragraph.  The

approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this share repurchase program has been reduced by the amount expended in connection with the option cancellations. 
    
  In July 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a stock option cancellation program to allow for outstanding and vested stock option awards granted in 2007 and expiring in 2017 to be canceled by the option holder at the closing day s stock price less the option exercise price.  This program was available for option holders to participate from July 25 through September 2, 2016. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , there were   1,061,500   options canceled for   $5.2 million  , which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.

[13] DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY 
    
  RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE OF USING DERIVATIVES 
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.  The  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts related to certain of the Company s fixed-rate loan assets and differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments related to certain of the Company's FHLB borrowings.  The Company also has derivatives that are a result of a service the Company provides to certain qualifying customers while at the same time the Company enters into an offsetting derivative transaction in order to eliminate its interest rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF INTEREST RATE RISK 
  The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate obligations due to changes in benchmark interest rates, which relate predominantly to LIBOR.  Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate payments from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   four   interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of   $2.9 million   that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company s fixed-rate loan assets.  The notional amounts for the derivatives express the face amount of the positions, however, credit risk was considered insignificant for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  There were   no   counterparty default losses on derivatives for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  For the   four   derivatives that were designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings by applying the  fair value long haul  method.  The Company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items in the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related derivatives.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   no   gain or loss in non-interest income related to hedge ineffectiveness as compared to   a net gain   of   $1,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The Company also recognized   a decrease   to interest income of   $24,000   and   $54,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to the Company s fair value hedges, which includes net settlements on the derivatives, and any amortization adjustment of the basis in the hedged items.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   a net gain   of   $2,000   in non-interest income related to hedge ineffectiveness as compared to   a net gain   of   $3,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The Company also recognized   a decrease   to interest income of   $71,000   and   $211,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to the Company s fair value hedges, which includes net settlements on the derivatives, and any amortization adjustment of the basis in the hedged items.

CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST RATE RISK 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  In June 2016, the Company entered into   two   derivative contracts to hedge the variable cash flows associated with certain FHLB borrowings.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.  The Company s cash flow hedge derivatives did not have any hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s debt.  During the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there was   an increase   to interest expense of   46,000  .  During the next twelve months, the Company estimates   $106,000   to be reclassified to earnings as   a decrease   to interest expense.  The Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a remaining period of   33 months  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   outstanding interest rate derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of   $100.0 million   that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk.  During the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   a net gain   of   $626,000   and   $538,000  , respectively, was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the effective portion of the derivative. 
    
  NON-DESIGNATED HEDGES 
  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers.  The Company executes interest rate derivatives with its commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.  Those derivatives are simultaneously and economically hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company eliminates its interest rate exposure resulting from such transactions.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   210   derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of   $883.9 million   related to this program.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   a net gain   of   $62,000   and   a net loss   of   $414,000  , respectively, related to changes in fair value of the derivatives not designated in hedging relationships.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   a net loss   of   $777,000   and   a net loss     $371,000  , respectively, related to changes in fair value of the derivatives not designated in hedging relationships.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES  
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 
    
  The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if either the Company or the counterparty fails to maintain its status as a well/adequately capitalized institution, then the Company or the counterparty could be required to terminate any outstanding derivative positions and settle its obligations under the agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the termination value of derivatives, including accrued interest, in a net liability position related to these agreements was   $20.3 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has posted collateral of   $23.8 million  .  If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of   September 30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value. 

[14] DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Fair value estimates of financial instruments are based on the present value of expected future cash flows, quoted market prices of similar financial instruments, if available, and other valuation techniques.  These valuations are significantly affected by discount rates, cash flow assumptions, and risk assumptions used.  Therefore, fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and are not intended to reflect the proceeds that may be realized in an immediate settlement of instruments.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented below do not represent the underlying value of the Company. 

37 

     Table of Contents  

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  In accordance with U.S. GAAP the Company must account for certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.  The Company utilizes a three-level fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices with readily available independent data in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable market inputs (Level 3).  When various inputs for measurement fall within multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest level input that has a significant impact on fair value measurement is used. 
    
  Financial assets and liabilities are categorized based upon the following characteristics or inputs to the valuation techniques: 

Level 1   Financial assets and liabilities for which inputs are observable and are obtained from reliable quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in actively traded markets.  This is the most reliable fair value measurement and includes, for example, active exchange-traded equity securities. 
                
    Level 2   Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which values are based on similar assets or liabilities that are actively traded.  Level 2 also includes pricing models in which the inputs are corroborated by market data, for example, matrix pricing. 
                
    Level 3   Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  Level 3 inputs include assumptions of a source independent of the reporting entity or the reporting entity s own assumptions that are supported by little or no market activity or observable inputs. 
       
  The Company is responsible for the valuation process and as part of this process may use data from outside sources in establishing fair value.  The Company performs due diligence to understand the inputs used or how the data was calculated or derived.  The Company corroborates the reasonableness of external inputs in the valuation process. 
    
  RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The following tables represent assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

38 

     Table of Contents  

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
  Generally, investment securities are valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs.  The valuations for debt and equity securities are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2.  U.S. Treasury Notes and equity securities (including mutual funds) are classified as Level 1 because these securities are in actively traded markets.  Investment securities within Level 2 include corporate bonds; single-issuer trust preferred securities; non-agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations; collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities, and debentures issued by U.S. government agencies. 
    
  INTEREST RATE SWAPS 
  The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated using inputs that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data and therefore, are classified as Level 2.  These fair value estimations include primarily market observable inputs such as the forward LIBOR swap curve. 
    
  ACQUISITION EARNOUT LIABILITY 
  The fair value of the acquisition earnout liability is estimated based on management s estimate of the projected annualized run-rate EBITDA of TKG at December 31, 2016, and therefore, are classified as Level 3.  For additional information on the calculation of the earnout, refer to   Note 2, Business Combinations  . 
    
  NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. 
    
  The following tables represent the balances of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

39 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $7.9 million   of specific reserves to the allowance for loan losses as a result of adjusting the fair value of impaired loans.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company recorded   $4.5 million   of specific reserves to allowance for loan losses as a result of adjusting the fair value of impaired loans. 
    
  IMPAIRED LOANS 
  A loan is considered impaired when management determines it is probable that all of the principal and interest due under the original terms of the loan may not be collected or if a loan is designated as a TDR.  Impairment is measured based on a discounted cash flows method or the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs.  Our policy is to obtain appraisals on collateral supporting impaired loans on an annual basis, unless circumstances dictate a shorter time frame.  Appraisals are reduced by estimated costs to sell the collateral, and, under certain circumstances, additional factors that may arise and cause us to believe our recovered value may be less than the independent appraised value.  Accordingly, impaired loans are classified as Level 3.  The Company measures impairment on all loans as part of the allowance for loan losses. 
    
  OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED 
  Real estate owned is comprised of property acquired through foreclosure or voluntarily conveyed by borrowers.  These assets are recorded on the date acquired at fair value, less estimated disposition costs, with the fair value being determined by appraisal.  Our policy is to obtain appraisals on collateral supporting OREO on an annual basis, unless circumstances dictate a shorter time frame.  Appraisals are reduced by estimated costs to sell the collateral, and, under certain circumstances, additional factors that may arise and cause us to believe our recovered value may be less than the independent appraised value.  Accordingly, real estate owned is classified as Level 3. 
    
  LEVEL 3 VALUATION 
    
  The following tables present additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis and for which we have utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals or liquidation analysis of the underlying collateral, which may include level 3 inputs that are not identifiable, or by using the discounted cash flow method if the loan is not collateral dependent.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  A summary of the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments is as follows: 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   transfers between fair value Levels 1, 2 or 3. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 
    
  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
  The carrying amount approximates fair value. 
    
  INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
  The fair values of investment securities available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and trading are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities, recently executed transactions and pricing models  . 
    
  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK 
  The carrying value of our FHLB stock, which is a marketable equity investment, approximates fair value. 
    
  LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT 
  The fair value of loans held-for-investment is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  Fair value as determined here does not represent an exit price.  Impaired loans are generally valued at the fair value of the associated collateral. 
    
  ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE 
  The carrying amount approximates fair value. 
    
  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVABLE 
  The carrying amount approximates fair value. 
    
  BANK OWNED LIFE INSURANCE 
  The fair value of the general account bank owned life insurance is based on the insurance contract net cash surrender value. 

41 

     Table of Contents  

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED 
  Real estate owned is recorded on the date acquired at fair value, less estimated disposition costs, with the fair value being determined by appraisal. 
    
  DEPOSITS 
  The fair value of demand deposits is the amount payable on demand as of the reporting date, i.e., their carrying amounts.  The fair value of fixed maturity deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  BORROWINGS 
  The fair value of borrowings is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using period end market rates for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  ACQUISITION EARNOUT LIABILITY 
  The carrying amount of the TKG acquisition earnout liability approximates fair value.  For additional information on the calculation of the earnout, refer to   Note 2, Business Combinations  . 
    
  INTEREST RATE SWAPS 
  The fair value of interest rate swaps are estimated through the assistance of an independent third party and compared to the fair value determined by the swap counterparty to establish reasonableness. 
    
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS 
  Fair values for the Company s off-balance sheet instruments, which consist of lending commitments, standby letters of credit and risk participation agreements related to interest rate swap agreements, are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  Management believes that the fair value of these off-balance sheet instruments is not significant.

  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act and section 21E of the Exchange Act.  These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control.  Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
    
  There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following:

General 
    
  We are a bank holding company that operates through two reporting segments:  Bank and Investment Management.  The Bank segment   provides commercial banking and private banking services to middle-market businesses and high-net-worth individuals through our TriState Capital Bank subsidiary.  The Bank segment   generates most of its revenue from interest on loans and investments, loan-related fees and deposit-related fees.  Its primary source of funding for loans is deposits.  Its largest expenses are interest on these deposits and salaries and related employee benefits.  The Investment Management segment   provides advisory and sub-advisory investment management services primarily to institutional plan sponsors through our Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC subsidiary and also will support distribution and marketing efforts for Chartwell s proprietary investment products through our Chartwell TSC Securities Corp. subsidiary, once it is registered as a broker/dealer with the SEC and FINRA.  The Investment Management segment generates most of its revenue from investment management fees earned on assets under management and its largest expenses are salaries and related employee benefits. 
    
  The following discussion and analysis presents our financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis, except where significant segment disclosures are necessary to better explain the operations of each segment and related variances.  In particular, the discussion and analysis of non-interest income and non-interest expense is reported by segment. 
    
  We measure our performance primarily through our earnings per common share; total revenue; and pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue.  Other salient metrics include the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans; net interest margin; the efficiency ratio of the Bank segment; assets under management; return on average assets; return on average equity; and regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios. 

Executive Overview 
    
  TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company ) is a bank holding company headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries:  TriState Capital Bank (the  Bank ), a Pennsylvania chartered bank; Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC ( Chartwell ), a registered investment advisor; and Chartwell TSC Securities Corp. ( CTSC Securities ),   which is applying to be registered as a broker/dealer with the SEC and FINRA  .  Through our bank subsidiary, we serve middle-market businesses in our primary markets throughout the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and New York.  We also serve high-net-worth individuals on a national basis through our private banking channel.  We market and distribute our products and services through a scalable, branchless banking model, which creates significant operating leverage throughout our business as we continue to grow.  Through our investment management subsidiary, we provide investment management services to institutional, sub-advisory, managed account and private clients on a national basis.  A  ssets under management were   $10.80 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Our broker/dealer subsidiary, once registered, will support any   distribution and marketing efforts for Chartwell s proprietary investment produ  cts that may require SEC or FINRA licensing.  
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our net income was   $8.5 million   compared to   $6.1 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $2.3 million  .  This increase was primarily due to the net impact of (1) a   $1.7 million  , or   10.0%  ,   increase   in our net interest income; and (2)   an increase   in non-interest income of   $4.5 million   largely related to higher investment management fees due to the TKG acquisition; offset by (3)   an increase   of   $3.2 million   in our non-interest expense largely related to the TKG acquisition; and (4) lower credit to provision for loan losses of   $799,000 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our net income was   $21.1 million   compared to   $16.9 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $4.2 million  .  This increase was primarily due to the net impact of (1) a   $5.0 million  , or   9.9%  ,   increase   in our net interest income; (2) higher credit to provision for loan losses of   $109,000  ; and (3)   an increase   in non-interest income of   $6.4 million  , largely related to higher investment management fees and higher swap revenue; offset by (4)   an increase   of   $6.0 million   in our non-interest expense; and (5) a   $1.3 million     increase   in income taxes. 
    
  Our diluted EPS was   $0.30   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.22   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   is a result of   an increase   of   $2.3 million   in our net income. 
    
  Our diluted EPS was   $0.75   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.60   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   is a result of   an increase   of   $4.2 million   in our net income. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , total revenue   increased     $6.2 million  , or   24.6%  , to   $31.2 million   from   $25.0 million   for the same period in   2015  , driven by higher   investment management fees,   higher net interest income for the Bank and   higher swap fees  .  P  re-tax, pre-provision net revenue   increased     $3.0 million  , or   38.3%  , to   $10.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $7.7 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily resulting from the higher total revenue partially offset by higher non-interest expense.

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , total revenue   increased     $11.3 million  , or   14.7%  , to   $88.1 million   from   $76.8 million   for the same period in   2015  , driven by higher net interest income for the Bank, higher investment management fees and higher swap fees.  P  re-tax, pre-provision net revenue   increased     $5.3 million  , or   21.5%  , to   $30.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $24.8 million   for the same period in   2015  , resulting from higher total revenue partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. 
    
  Our annualized net interest margin was   2.18%   and   2.25%   for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   2.32%   and   2.39%  , for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.    The most significant factor driving net interest margin compression has been our shift toward lower-risk assets, notably the marketable-securities-backed private banking margin loan portfolio that the Bank has made its fastest growing channel, as well as an increase in the cost of funds. 
    
  For the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Bank s efficiency ratio was   62.01%   and   60.36%  , respectively, as compared to   64.93%   and   62.36%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  Our non-interest expense to average assets for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   2.27%   and   2.25%  , respectively, compared to   2.25%   and   2.35%  , for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Our annualized return on average assets was   0.93%   and   0.82%   for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   0.79%   and   0.76%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  Our annualized return on average equity was   9.88%   and   8.42%  , for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   as compared to   7.64%   and   7.23%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The increase in these ratios is due to continued growth in earnings from both the banking and investment management segments. 
    
  Total assets of   $3.72 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $413.3 million  , or   16.7%   on an annualized basis, from   December 31, 2015  .  Loans held-for-investment   grew   by   $333.4 million   to   $3.17 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an annualized increase of   15.7%  , from   December 31, 2015  , as a result of growth in our commercial and private banking loan portfolios.  Total deposits   increased     $397.4 million  , or   19.7%   on an annualized basis, to   $3.09 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Adverse rated credits to total loans   declined   to   1.59%   at   September 30, 2016  , from   1.92%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The allowance for loan losses to loans was   0.64%   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.63%   as of   December 31, 2015  .    The credit to provision for loan losses was   $542,000   and   $340,000   for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to credit of provision of   $1.3 million   and   $231,000   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The   credit to provision in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , reflected declining adverse rated credits and net recoveries, offset by increases to specific reserves on non-performing loans. 
    
  Our book value per common share   increased     $0.50   to   $12.12   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   $11.62   as of   December 31, 2015  , largely as a result of an increase in our net income, partially offset by the issuance of restricted stock and the cancellation of stock options during   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The information set forth above contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP.  These non-GAAP financial measures are  total revenue,   pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue,  and  efficiency ratio.   Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of our business, these measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies. 
    
   Total revenue  is defined as net interest income and non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale and call of investment securities.  We believe adjustments made to our operating revenue allow management and investors to better assess our operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain other items that are unrelated to our core business. 
    
   Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue  is defined as net income, without giving effect to loan loss provision and income taxes, and excluding gains and losses on the sale and call of investment securities.  We believe this measure is important because it allows management and investors to better assess our performance in relation to our core operating revenue, excluding the volatility that is associated with provision for loan losses or other items that are unrelated to our core business. 
    
   Efficiency ratio  is defined as non-interest expense, excluding acquisition related items and intangible amortization expense, where applicable, divided by our total revenue.  We believe this measure, particularly at the Bank, allows management and investors to better assess our operating expenses in relation to our core operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to our core business.

Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.  Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in interest yields earned and rates paid.  Maintaining consistent spreads between earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is significant to our financial performance because net interest income comprised   62.8%   and   65.6%   of total revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The table below reflects an analysis of net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, for the periods indicated.  The adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the statutory federal income tax rate of 35.0%. 

(1)   
    Net interest margin is calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis. 
       
  The following table provides information regarding the average balances and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average balances and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Non-accrual loans are included in the calculation of the average loan balances, while interest collected on non-accrual loans is recorded as a reduction to principal.  Where applicable, interest income and yield are reflected on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and have been adjusted based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 35.0%.

  Net Interest Income for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Net interest income, calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis,   increased     $1.7 million  , or   9.9%  , to   $18.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $17.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in net interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to a   $501.5 million  , or   17.2%  ,   increase   in average interest-earning assets driven largely by loan growth.  The   increase   in net interest income reflects   an increase   of   $3.9 million  , or   18.6%  , in interest income, partially offset by   an increase   of   $2.2 million  , or   56.1%  , in interest expense.  Net interest margin   decreased   to   2.18%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   2.32%   for the same period in   2015  , driven by higher interest expense associated with the higher volumes and cost of deposits and FHLB borrowings. 
    
  The   increase   in interest income was primarily the result of   an increase   in average total loans of   $463.1 million  , or   17.8%  , which is our primary earning asset and the Bank s core business.  The most significant factors driving the yield on our loan portfolio has been our shift toward lower-risk assets, notably the marketable-securities-backed private banking loan portfolio that the Bank has made its fastest growing channel  , which was offset by the effect on our floating-rate loans due to the Federal Reserve s increase in the target federal funds rate in December 2015  .  The overall yield on interest-earning assets   increased     four   basis points to   2.90%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   2.86%   for the same period in   2015  , primarily from higher yields on investment securities. 
    
  Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities of   $6.2 million  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $2.2 million  , or   56.1%  , from the same period in   2015   as a result of   an increase   of   $485.5 million  , or   18.9%  , in average interest-bearing liabilities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , coupled with   an increase   of   19   basis points in the average rate paid on our average interest-bearing liabilities compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in average rate paid was reflective of increases in rates paid in all deposit categories and FHLB borrowings.  The   increase   in average interest-bearing liabilities was driven primarily by   an increase   of  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

$269.7 million   in average money market deposit accounts,   an increase   of   $92.8 million   in average interest-bearing checking accounts and   an increase   of   $143.8 million   in average FHLB borrowings. 
    
  The following table analyzes the dollar amount of the change in interest income and interest expense with respect to the primary components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or interest expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances or changes in interest rates for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The effect of a change in balances is measured by applying the average rate during the first period to the balance ( volume ) change between the two periods.  The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two periods to the average volume during the first period.

    The change in interest income and expense due to change in composition and applicable yields and rates has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. 
       
  The following table provides information regarding the average balances and yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average balances and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Non-accrual loans are included in the calculation of the average loan balances, while interest collected on non-accrual loans is recorded as a reduction to principal.  Where applicable, interest income and yield are reflected on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and have been adjusted based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 35.0%.

    Net interest income and net interest margin are calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis. 
       
  Net Interest Income for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Net interest income, calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis,   increased     $5.0 million  , or   9.8%  , to   $55.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $50.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in net interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to a   $458.8 million  , or   16.2%  ,   increase   in average interest-earning assets driven largely by loan growth.  The   increase   in net interest income reflects   an increase   of   $10.4 million  , or   16.8%  , in interest income, partially offset by   an increase   of   $5.4 million  , or   48.1%  , in interest expense.  Net interest margin   decreased   to   2.25%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   2.39%   for the same period in   2015  , driven by lower loan yields and higher interest expense associated with the higher volumes and costs of deposits and FHLB borrowings. 
    
  The   increase   in interest income was primarily the result of   an increase   in average total loans of   $425.3 million  , or   16.9%  , which is our primary earning asset and the Bank s core business,   an increase   of   $24.9 million  , or   12.2%  , in average investment securities balances and   an increase   of   49   basis points in yield on investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by   a decrease   of   four   basis points in yield on our loans.  The most significant factors driving the yield on our loan portfolio has been our shift toward lower-risk assets, notably the marketable-securities-backed private banking loan portfolio that the Bank has made its fastest growing channel  , which was partially offset by the effect on our floating-rate loans due to the Federal Reserve s increase in the target federal funds rate in December 2015  .  The overall yield on interest-earning assets   increased     two   basis points to   2.94%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   2.92%   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities of   $16.8 million  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $5.4 million  , or   48.1%  , from the same period in   2015  , as a result of   an increase   of   $454.2 million  , or   18.4%  , in average interest-bearing liabilities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , coupled with   an increase   of   16   basis points in the average rate paid on our average interest-

bearing liabilities compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in average rate paid was reflective of increases in rates paid in all deposit categories and FHLB borrowings.  The   increase   in average interest-bearing liabilities was driven primarily by   an increase   of   $270.8 million   in average money market deposit accounts, and   an increase   of   $56.6 million   in average interest-bearing checking accounts and   an increase   of   $140.4 million  , in average FHLB borrowings. 
    
  The following table analyzes the dollar amount of the change in interest income and interest expense with respect to the primary components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or interest expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances or changes in interest rates for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The effect of a change in balances is measured by applying the average rate during the first period to the balance ( volume ) change between the two periods.  The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two periods to the average volume during the first period.

    The change in interest income and expense due to change in composition and applicable yields and rates has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. 

Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The provision for loan losses represents our determination of the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered adequate in relation to the estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  For additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses, see    Allowance for Loan Losses.  
    
  Credit to Provision for Loan Losses for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .    We recorded a credit to provision for loan losses of   $542,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a credit to provision of   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The credit to provision for loan losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was comprised of recoveries of $3.5 million and a net decrease in general reserves of $1.0 million on lower volume of non-pass rated commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a net increase of $3.7 million in specific reserves on two commercial and industrial non-performing loans.  The credit to provision for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , was largely driven by a $1.1 million reserve reversal from payoffs on two substandard-rated credits and one recovery of $433,000 all on commercial and industrial loans. 
    
  Credit to Provision for Loan Losses for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .    We recorded a credit to provision for loan losses of   $340,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a credit to provision of   $231,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The credit to provision for loan losses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was comprised of recoveries of $4.1 million, a net decrease in general reserves of $1.1 million on lower volume of non-pass rated commercial and industrial loans, and a decrease of $197,000 of specific reserves on private banking non-performing loans related to paydowns partially offset by

a net increase of $5.1 million in specific reserves on three commercial and industrial non-performing loans, of which $1.5 million was charged-off.  The credit to provision for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was comprised of a net decrease of $1.9 million in general reserves on commercial and industrial loans as described above and recoveries of $794,000, offset by increased specific reserves of $2.2 million on commercial and industrial non-performing loans, of which $1.5 million was charged-off. 

Non-Interest Income 
    
  Non-interest income is an important component of our revenue and it is comprised primarily of investment management fees for Chartwell coupled with fees generated from loan and deposit relationships with our Bank customers, including swap transactions.  In addition, from time to time as opportunities arise, we sell portions of our investment securities available-for-sale portfolio or securities may be called within our investment securities available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolios.  Gains or losses experienced on these sales or calls are less predictable than many of the other components of our non-interest income because the amount of realized gains or losses is impacted by a number of factors, including the nature of the security sold or called, the purpose of the sale, the interest rate environment and other market conditions.    The information provided under the caption  Parent and Other  represents general operating expenses of the Company not considered to be a reportable segment, which includes the parent company activity as well as eliminations and adjustments that are necessary for purposes of reconciliation to the consolidated amounts.

Non-Interest Expense 
    
  Our non-interest expense represents the operating cost of maintaining and growing our business.  The largest portion of non-interest expense for each segment is compensation and employee benefits, which include employee payroll expense as well as the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes, all of which are impacted by the growth in our employee base, coupled with increases in the level of compensation and benefits of our existing employees.

Income Taxes 
    
  We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities with regard to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  We evaluate whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of identified deferred tax assets. 
    
  Income Taxes for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .    For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized income tax expense of   $2.8 million  , or   24.7%   of income before tax, as compared to income tax expense of   $2.9 million  , or   32.5%   of income before tax, for the same period in   2015  .  Our effective tax rate of   24.7%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , decreased as compared to the prior year due to a higher level of investment tax credits recognized in 2016 versus 2015. 
    
  Income Taxes for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized income tax expense of   $9.5 million  , or   31.0%   of income before tax, as compared to income tax expense of   $8.1 million  , or   32.5%   of income before tax, for the same period in   2015  .  Our effective tax rate of   31.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , decreased as compared to the prior year due to a higher level of investment tax credits recognized in 2016 versus 2015. 

Financial Condition 
    
  Our total assets as of   September 30, 2016  , were   $3.72 billion  , which was   an increase   of   $413.3 million  , or   16.7%   on an annualized basis, from   December 31, 2015  , driven primarily by growth in our loan portfolio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our loan portfolio of   $3.17 billion  ,   increased     $333.4 million  , or   15.7%   annualized, from   December 31, 2015  .  Total investment securities   increased     $17.9 million  , or   10.6%   annualized, to   $243.3 million  , as of   September 30, 2016  , from   December 31, 2015  , primarily as a result of purchases of investment grade corporate bonds and non-agency collateralized loan obligations.  Cash and cash equivalents   increased     $24.1 million  , to   $120.7 million  , as of   September 30, 2016  , from   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total deposits of   $3.09 billion     increased     $397.4 million  , or   19.7%   annualized, from   December 31, 2015  , primarily to fund loan growth.  Net borrowings   decreased     $14.8 million  , to   $239.5 million  , as of   September 30, 2016  , from   December 31, 2015  .  Our shareholders  equity   increased     $17.2 million   to   $343.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   December 31, 2015  .  This   increase   was primarily the result of   $21.1 million   in net income and the impact of   $2.7 million   in stock-based compensation, partially offset by the cancellation of stock options of   $5.2 million   and the purchase of   $4.3 million   in treasury stock. 

Loans 
    
  The Bank s primary source of income is interest on loans.  Our loan portfolio primarily consists of loans to our private banking clients, commercial and industrial loans, and real estate loans secured by commercial properties.  The loan portfolio represents our largest earning asset.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   87.2%   of our loans have a floating rate. 
    
  The following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: 

Loans Held-for-Investment.    Loans held-for-investment   increased   by   $333.4 million  , or   15.7%   on an annualized basis, to   $3.17 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   December 31, 2015  .  Our growth for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was comprised of   an increase   in private banking loans of   $242.2 million  , or   24.1%   annualized,   a decrease   in commercial and industrial loans of   $68.5 million  , or   14.4%   annualized, and   an increase   in commercial real estate loans of   $159.7 million  , or   24.7%   annualized.

     Table of Contents  

Primary Loan Categories 
    
  Private Banking Loans.    Our private banking loans include personal and commercial loans that are sourced through our private banking channel of financial intermediaries, which operates on a national basis.  These loans primarily consist of loans made to high-net-worth individuals, trusts and businesses that may be secured by cash, marketable securities, residential property or other financial assets.  The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income and assets of the borrower.      We also have a limited number of unsecured loans and lines of credit in our private banking loan portfolio. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $1.44 billion  , or   90.5%  , of private banking loans that were secured by cash and marketable securities as compared to   $1.18 billion  , or   87.8%  , as of   December 31, 2015  .    Our private banking lines of credit are typically due on demand.    The growth in loans secured by cash and marketable securities is expected to continue as a result of our strategy to focus on this portion of our private banking business as we believe these loans tend to have a lower risk profile and are typically zero risk-weighted for regulatory capital purposes.    On a daily basis, we monitor the collateral of these margin loans secured by cash and marketable securities, which further reduces the risk profile of the private banking portfolio.  Since inception, we have had no charge-offs related to our loans secured by cash and marketable securities. 
    
  Loans sourced through our private banking channel also include loans for commercial and business purposes, a majority of which are secured by cash and marketable securities.  The table below includes all loans made through our private banking channel, by collateral type, as of the dates indicated. 

Middle-Market Banking - Commercial and Industrial Loans.    Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio primarily includes loans made to service companies or manufacturers generally for the purpose of production, operating capacity, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment financing, acquisitions and recapitalizations.  Cash flow from the borrower s operations is the primary source of repayment for these loans, except for certain commercial loans that are secured by cash and marketable securities. 
    
  Middle-Market Banking - Commercial Real Estate Loans.    Our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans secured by commercial purpose real estate, including both owner occupied properties and investment properties for various purposes including office, retail, industrial, multifamily and hospitality.  Also included are commercial construction loans to finance the construction or renovation of structures as well as to finance the acquisition and development of raw land for various purposes.    Individual project cash flows, global cash flows and liquidity from the developer, or the sale of the property are the primary sources of repayment for these loans. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $832.3 million   of total commercial real estate loans with a floating rate and   $189.6 million   with a fixed rate, as compared to   $650.0 million   and   $212.2 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  .

Loan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
    
  The following table presents the contractual maturity ranges and the amount of such loans with fixed and adjustable rates in each maturity range as of the date indicated. 

Interest Reserve Loans 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , loans with interest reserves totaled   $145.5 million  , which represented   4.6%   of loans held-for-investment, as compared to   $117.4 million  , or   4.1%  , as of   December 31, 2015  .  Certain loans reserve a portion of the proceeds to be used to pay interest due on the loan.  These loans with interest reserves are common for construction and land development loans.  The use of interest reserves is based on the feasibility of the project, the creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, and the loan to value coverage of the collateral.  The interest reserve may be used by the borrower, when certain financial conditions are met, to draw loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of the loan.  When drawn, the interest is capitalized and added to the loan balance, subject to conditions specified during the initial underwriting and at the time the credit is approved.  We have effective and ongoing procedures and controls for monitoring compliance with loan covenants, for advancing funds and determining default conditions.  In addition, most of our construction lending is performed within our geographic footprint and our lenders are familiar with trends in the local real estate market. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at a specific point in time.  This estimate includes losses associated with specifically identified loans, as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio.  Additions are made to the allowance through both periodic provisions charged to income and recoveries of losses previously incurred.  Reductions to the allowance occur as loans are charged off or when the credit history of any of the three loan portfolios improves.  Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance quarterly.  This evaluation is subjective and requires material estimates that may change over time.    In addition, management evaluates the allowance for loan losses overall methodology and estimates used in the calculation on an annual basis. 
    
  The components of the allowance for loan losses represent estimates based upon ASC Topic 450,   Contingencies  , and ASC Topic 310,   Receivables  .  ASC Topic 450 applies to homogeneous loan pools such as consumer installment, residential mortgages and consumer lines of credit, as well as commercial loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment under ASC Topic 310.  ASC Topic 310 is applied to commercial and consumer loans that are individually evaluated for impairment. 
    
  Under ASC Topic 310, a loan is impaired, based upon current information and events, in management s opinion, when it is probable that the loan will not be repaid according to its original contractual terms, including both principal and interest, or if a loan is designated as a TDR.  Management performs individual assessments of impaired loans to determine the existence of loss exposure based upon a discounted cash flows method or where a loan is collateral dependent, based upon the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. 
    
  In estimating probable loan loss under ASC Topic 450 we consider numerous factors, including historical charge-offs and subsequent recoveries.  We also consider, but are not limited to, qualitative factors that influence our credit quality, such as delinquency and non-performing loan trends, changes in loan underwriting guidelines and credit policies, as well as the results of internal loan reviews.  Finally, we consider the impact of changes in current local and regional economic conditions in the markets that we serve.  Assessment of relevant economic factors indicates that some of our primary markets historically tend to lag the national economy, with local economies in those primary markets also improving or weakening, as the case may be, but at a more measured rate than the national trends.

     Table of Contents  

We base the computation of the allowance for loan losses under ASC Topic 450 on two factors:  the primary factor and the secondary factor.  The primary factor is based   on the inherent risk identified within each of the Company s three loan portfolios based on the historical loss experience of each loan portfolio and the loss emergence period.  Management has developed a methodology that is applied to each of our three primary loan portfolios, consisting of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and private banking.  As the loan loss history, mix and risk rating of each loan portfolio change, the primary factor adjusts accordingly.  The allowance for loan losses related to the primary factor is based on our estimates as to prob  able losses for each loan portfolio.  The secondary factor is intended to capture risks related to events and circumstances that management believes have an impact on the performance of the loan portfolio.  Although this factor is more subjective in nature, the methodology focuses on internal and external trends in pre-specified categories (risk factors) and applies a quantitative percentage that drives the secondary factor.  We have identified nine risk factors and each risk factor is assigned a reserve level, based on management s judgment, as to the probable impact on each loan portfolio and is monitored on a quarterly basis.  As the trend in each risk factor changes, a corresponding change occurs in the reserve associated with each respective risk factor, such that the secondary factor remains current to changes in each loan portfolio.  Potential problem loans are identified and monitored through frequent, formal review processes.  Updates are presented to our board of directors as to the status of loan quality at least quarterly. 
    
  The following table summarizes the allowance for loan losses, as of the dates indicated: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had specific reserves totaling   $7.9 million   related to   four   commercial and industrial loans and   two   unsecured private banking loans, with an aggregated total outstanding balance of   $20.7 million  .  All of these loans were on non-accrual status as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had specific reserves totaling   $4.5 million   related to   three   commercial and industrial loans and   two   unsecured private banking loans, with an aggregated total outstanding balance of   $12.5 million  .  All of these loans were on non-accrual status as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following table summarizes allowance for loan losses by loan category and percentage of loans, as of the dates indicated: 

Allowance for Loan Losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .    Our allowance for loan losses   increased   to   $20.2 million  , or   0.64%   of loans, as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $18.0 million  , or   0.63%   of loans, as of   December 31, 2015  .  Our allowance for loan losses related to commercial and industrial loans   increased     $2.5 million   to   $13.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $11.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , which was attributable to a net increase of specific reserves of   $3.6 million   on non-performing loans partially offset by overall decreases in the commercial and industrial loan balances.  Our allowance for loan losses related to commercial real estate loans   decreased   by   $236,000   to   $5.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $5.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the overall strong credit quality of this portfolio partially offset by loan growth.  Our allowance for loan losses related to private banking loans   increased     $21,000   to   $1.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , from     December 31, 2015  , which was attributable to growth in this portfolio offset by lower specific reserves related to paydowns on non-performing loans. 
    
  Net Charge-Offs / Recoveries 
    
  Our charge-off policy for commercial and private banking loans requires that loans and other obligations that are not collectible be promptly charged off in the month the loss becomes probable, regardless of the delinquency status of the loan.  We recognize a partial charge-off when we have determined that the value of the collateral is less than the remaining ledger balance at the time of the evaluation.  A loan or obligation is not required to be charged off, regardless of delinquency status, if (1) we have determined there exists sufficient  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

collateral to protect the remaining loan balance and (2) there exists a strategy to liquidate the collateral.  We may also consider a number of other factors to determine when a charge-off is appropriate, including:  the status of a bankruptcy proceeding; the value of collateral and probability of successful liquidation; and the status of adverse proceedings or litigation that may result in collection. 
    
  The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge-offs/recoveries for the periods indicated: 

Net Recoveries for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016  .    Our net loan recoveries of   $3.5 million  , or   0.46%   of average loans on an annualized basis, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , were related to a recovery of   $3.4 million   on   one   commercial real estate loan and   $127,000   in recoveries on   three   commercial and industrial loans. 
    
  Net Charge-Offs for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  .    Our net loan charge-offs of   $716,000  , or   0.11%   of average loans on an annualized basis, for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , were related to a charge-off of   $1.5 million   on   one   commercial and industrial loan, which was previously reserved, and   $770,000   in recoveries on   two   commercial and industrial loans. 
    
  Net Recoveries for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016  .    Our net loan recoveries of   $2.6 million  , or   0.12%   of average loans on an annualized basis, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were related to a charge-off of   $1.5 million   on   one   commercial and industrial loan, of which   $1.3 million   was previously reserved, a recovery of   $3.4 million   on   one   commercial real estate loan and   $708,000   in recoveries on   six   commercial and industrial loans. 
    
  Net Charge-Offs for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  .    Our net loan charge-offs of   $692,000  , or   0.04%   of average loans on an annualized basis, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , were related to a charge-off of   $1.5 million   on one commercial and industrial loan, recoveries of   $781,000   on   four   commercial and industrial loans and a recovery of   $13,000   on   one   private banking loan. 
    
  Non-Performing Assets 
    
  Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and other real estate owned.  Non-performing loans are loans that are on non-accrual status.  OREO is real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral underlying defaulted loans and includes in-substance foreclosures.  We record OREO at   fair value, less estimated costs to sell the assets. 
    
  Our policy is to place loans in all categories on non-accrual status when collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or when interest or principal payments are 90 days or more past due.  There were   no   loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and there was   no   interest income recognized on these l  oans, while on non-accrual status, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , non-performing loans were   $20.7 million  , or   0.65%   of total loans, compared to   $16.7 million  , or   0.59%   of total loans, as of   December 31, 2015  .  We had specific reserves of   $7.9 million   and   $4.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, on these non-performing loans.  The net loan balance of our non-performing loans was   47.7%   and   38.0%   of the original loan balance after payments, charge-offs and specific reserves as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   five   of the   six   non-performing loans are paying as agreed.

For additional information on our non-performing loans for   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , refer to   Note 5, Allowance for Loan Losses  , to our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Once the determination is made that a foreclosure   is necessary, the loan is reclassified as  in-substance foreclosure  until a sale date and title to the property is finalized.  Once we own the property, it is maintained, marketed, rented and sold to repay the original loan.  Historically, foreclosure trends in our loan portfolio have been low due to the seasoning of our portfolio.  Any loans that are modified or extended are reviewed for potential classification as a TDR loan.  For borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty, we complete a process that outlines the terms of the modification, the reasons for the proposed modification and documents the current status of the borrower. 
    
  We had non-performing assets of   $25.0 million  , or   0.67%   of total assets, as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $18.4 million  , or   0.56%   of total assets, as of   December 31, 2015  .  The   increase   in non-performing assets was primarily the result of additions of   $11.8 million   on two non-performing loan and transfers of collateral to OREO, partially offset by   $5.3 million   in reductions on non-performing loans and a sale of OREO during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was considered within the assessment of the determination of the allowance for loan losses.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   eight   OREO properties totaling   $4.3 million   and   three   OREO properties totaling   $1.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following table summarizes our non-performing assets as of the dates indicated:

  Potential Problem Loans 
    
  Potential problem loans are those loans that are not categorized as non-performing loans, but where current information indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with repayment terms.  Among other factors, we monitor past due status as an indicator of credit deterioration and potential problem loans.  A loan is considered past due when the contractual principal or interest due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement remains unpaid after the due date of the scheduled payment.  To the extent that loans become past due, we assess the potential for loss on such loans as we would with other problem loans and consider the effect of any potential loss in determining any provision for probable loan losses.  We also assess alternatives to maximize collection of any past due loans, including and without limitation, restructuring loan terms, requiring additional loan guarantee(s) or collateral, or other planned action. 
    
  For additional information on the age analysis of past due loans segregated by class of loan for   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , refer to   Note 5, Allowance for Loan Losses  , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On a monthly basis, we monitor various credit quality indicators for our loan portfolio, including delinquency, non-performing status, changes in risk ratings, changes in the underlying performance of the borrowers and other relevant factors. 
    
  We also monitor the loan portfolio through an internal risk rating system on a periodic basis.  Loan risk ratings are assigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Loan risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to internal policies.  Loans within the pass rating are viewed to have a lower risk of loss than loans that are risk rated as special mention, substandard and doubtful, which are viewed to have an increasing risk of loss.  Our internal risk ratings are consistent with regulatory guidance.

Investment Securities 
    
  We utilize investment activities to enhance net interest income while supporting interest rate risk management and liquidity management.  Our securities portfolio consists of available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities and from time to time, securities held for trading purposes.  Also included in our investment securities is Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.  For additional information on FHLB stock, refer to   Note 3, Investment Securities  .  Securities purchased with the intent to sell under trading activity are recorded at fair value and changes to fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.  Securities categorized as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized as a component of total shareholders  equity, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of deferred taxes.  Securities categorized as held-to-maturity are   debt securities that the Company intends to hold until maturity and are recorded at amortized cost. 
    
  On a quarterly basis, we determine the fair market value of our investment securities based on information provided by external sources.  In addition, on a quarterly basis, we conduct an internal evaluation of changes in the fair market value of our investment securities to gain a level of comfort with the market value information received from the external sources. 
    
  Securities, like loans, are subject to interest rate and credit risk.  In addition, by their nature, securities classified as available-for-sale are also subject to fair value risks that could negatively affect the level of liquidity available to us, as well as shareholders  equity.  The Bank has engaged Chartwell to provide securities portfolio advisory services, subject to the investment parameters set forth in our investment policy. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we reported securities in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity categories.  In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices of identical assets, when available.  Where sufficient data is not available to produce a fair valuation, fair value is based on broker quotes for similar assets.  Quarterly, we validate the prices received from these third parties by comparing them to prices provided by a different independent pricing service.  We have also reviewed the valuation methodologies provided to us by our pricing services.  Broker quotes may be adjusted to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value.  Adjustments may include unobservable parameters, among other things. 
    
  We perform a quarterly review of our investment securities to identify those that may indicate other-than-temporary impairment.  Our policy for OTTI is based upon a number of factors, including but not limited to, the length of time and extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition of the underlying issuer, the ability of the issuer to meet contractual obligations, the likelihood of the investment security s ability to recover any decline in its estimated fair value and whether we intend to sell the investment security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment security prior to its recovery.  If the financial markets experience deterioration, charges to income could occur in future periods as a result of OTTI determinations. 
    
  Our available-for-sale securities portfolio consists of U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, all with varying contractual maturities, and certain equity securities.  Our held-to-maturity portfolio consists of certain municipal bonds and corporate bonds while our trading portfolio, when active, typically consists of U.S. Treasury Notes, also with varying contractual maturities.  However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as the securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities.  The effective duration of our securities portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   1.5  , where duration is defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100 basis point change in rates.  No investment in any of these securities exceeds any applicable limitation imposed by law or regulation.  Our Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ) reviews the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis to ensure that the investments conform to our investment policy. 
    
  Available-for-Sale Investment Securities.    We held   $183.1 million   and   $168.3 million   in investment securities available-for-sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The   increase   of   $14.8 million   was primarily attributable to the net activity of purchases of   $27.4 million  , repayments of   $9.2 million   and sales of   $4.7 million   of certain securities   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On a fair value basis,   67.8%   of our available-for-sale investment securities as of   September 30, 2016  , were floating-rate securities, for which yields increase or decrease based on changes in market interest rates.  As of   December 31, 2015  , floating-rate securities comprised   74.3%   of our available-for-sale investment securities. 
    
  On a fair value basis,   41.6%   of our available-for-sale investment securities as of   September 30, 2016  , were agency securities, which tend to have a lower risk profile, while the remainder of the portfolio was comprised of certain corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred  
  
   65 

     Table of Contents  

securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations, and certain equity securities.  As of   December 31, 2015  , agency securities comprised   49.2%   of our available-for-sale investment securities. 
    
  Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities.    We held   $51.0 million   and   $47.3 million   in investment securities held-to-maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As part of our asset and liability management strategy, we determined that we have the intent and ability to hold these bonds until maturity, and these securities were reported at amortized cost, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Trading Investment Securities.    We held   no   investment securities for trading as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  From time to time, we may identify opportunities in the marketplace to generate supplemental income from trading activity, principally based on the volatility of U.S. Treasury Notes with maturities up to ten years.  The level and frequency of income generated from these transactions can vary materially based upon market conditions. 
    
  The following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, as of the dates indicated: 

66 

     Table of Contents  

The change in the fair values of our municipal bonds, agency collateralized mortgage obligation and agency mortgage-backed securities are primarily the result of interest rate fluctuations.  To assess for impairment on municipal bonds, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency   collateralized loan obligations,     and certain equity securities  , management evaluates the underlying issuer s financial performance and the related credit rating information through a review of publicly available financial statements and other publicly available information.  This review did not identify any issues related to the ultimate repayment of principal and interest on these securities.  In addition, the Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position until recovery of their amortized cost.  Based on this, the Company considers all of the unrealized losses to be temporary impairment losses. 

67 

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth the fair value, contractual maturities and approximated weighted average yield, calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, based on estimated annual income divided by the average amortized cost of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios as of   September 30, 2016  .  Contractual maturities may differ from expected maturities because issuers and/or borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties, which would also impact the corresponding yield. 

The table above excludes equity securities   because they have an indefinite life.    For additional information regarding our investment securities portfolios, refer to   Note 3, Investment Securities  , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Deposits 
    
  Deposits are our primary source of funds to support our earning assets and we source deposits through multiple channels.  We have focused on creating and growing diversified, stable, and low all-in cost deposit channels without operating through a traditional branch network.  These sources primarily include deposits from high-net-worth individuals, family offices, trust companies, wealth management firms, middle-market businesses and their executives, and other financial institutions.  We compete for deposits by offering a range of products and services to our customers, at competitive rates.  We believe that our deposit base is stable, diversified and provides a low all-in cost.  We further believe we have the ability to attract new deposits that will contribute to funding our projected loan growth. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we consider approximately   80.0%   of our total deposits to be relationship-based deposits.  Some of our relationship-based deposits, including reciprocal certificates of deposit placed through Promontory s CDARS        service and demand deposits placed through Promontory s ICS        service, have been classified for regulatory purposes as brokered deposits.

Borrowings 
    
  Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities, as well as the Bank s general business purposes.  As an alternative source of liquidity, we may obtain advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, sell investment securities subject to our obligation to repurchase them, purchase Federal funds or engage in overnight borrowings from the FHLB or our correspondent banks. 
    
  The following table presents certain information with respect to our outstanding borrowings, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

In June 2016, the Company entered into a cash flow hedge derivative transaction to establish the interest rate paid on   $100.0 million   of the FHLB borrowings at an effective rate of   0.83%   plus the difference between the 3-month FHLB advance rate and 3-month LIBOR for a period of three years.  For additional information on the cash flow hedge, refer to   Note 13, Derivatives and Hedging Activity  , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Liquidity 
    
  We evaluate liquidity both at the holding company level and at the Bank level.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank and Chartwell subsidiaries represent our only material assets.  Our primary sources of funds at the parent company level are cash on hand, dividends paid to us from the Bank and Chartwell subsidiaries and the net proceeds from the issuance of our debt or equity securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our primary liquidity needs at the parent company level were   the semi-annual interest payments   on the subordinated notes payable, funding of acquisitions and our share repurchase programs.  All other liquidity needs were minimal and related to reimbursing the Bank for management, accounting and financial reporting services provided by bank personnel.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the parent company paid   $15.0 million   related to the TKG acquisition,   $9.5 million   related to share repurchase programs and   $2.0 million   related to interest payments on the subordinated notes.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,

the parent company paid   $2.2 million   related to interest payments on the subordinated notes,   $3.2 million   related to share repurchase programs, and   $17.2 million   related to the earnout consideration for the Chartwell acquisition.  We believe that our cash on hand at the parent company level coupled with the dividend paying capacity of the Bank and Chartwell, were adequate to fund any foreseeable parent company obligations as of   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, the holding company established an unsecured line of credit of   $25.0 million  , effective December 29, 2015, with Texas Capital Bank.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the   full   amount of this established line was available. 
    
  Our goal in liquidity management at the Bank level is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs.  These requirements include the payment of deposits on demand at their contractual maturity, the repayment of borrowings as they mature, the payment of our ordinary business obligations, the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments, and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities.  Our ALCO has established an asset/liability management policy designed to achieve and maintain earnings performance consistent with long-term goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk, well capitalized regulatory status and adequate levels of liquidity.  The ALCO has also established a contingency funding plan to address liquidity crisis conditions.  The ALCO is designated as the body responsible for the monitoring and implementation of these policies.  The ALCO, which includes members of executive management, reviews liquidity on a frequent basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions. 
    
  Our principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and cash due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, unpledged securities available-for-sale, loan repayments (scheduled and unscheduled) and earnings.  Liability liquidity sources include a stable deposit base, the ability to renew maturing certificates of deposit, borrowing availability at the FHLB of Pittsburgh, unsecured lines with other financial institutions, access to the brokered deposit market including CDARS       , and the ability to raise debt and equity.  Customer deposits are an important source of liquidity, which depends on the confidence of those customers in us and is supported by our capital position and the protection provided by FDIC insurance. 
    
  We measure and monitor liquidity on an ongoing basis, which allows us to more effectively understand and react to trends in our balance sheet.  In addition, the ALCO uses a variety of methods to monitor our liquidity position, including a liquidity gap, which measures potential sources and uses of funds over future periods.  Policy guidelines have been established for a variety of liquidity-related performance metrics, such as net loans to deposits, brokered funding composition, cash to total loans and duration of certificates of deposit, among others, all of which are utilized in measuring and managing our liquidity position.  The ALCO performs contingency funding and capital stress analyses at least semi-annually to determine our ability to meet potential liquidity and capital needs under various stress scenarios. 
    
  We believe that our liquidity position continues to be strong due to our ability to generate strong growth in deposits, which is evidenced by our ratio of total deposits to total assets of   83.1%   and   81.5%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had available liquidity of   $702.5 million  , or   18.9%   of total assets.  These sources consisted of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, and investment securities available-for-sale and not pledged under the FHLB borrowing capacity), totaling   $247.0 million  , or   6.6%   of total assets, coupled with secondary sources of liquidity (the ability to borrow from the FHLB and correspondent bank lines) totaling   $455.5 million  , or   12.3%   of total assets.  Available cash excludes pledged accounts for derivative and letter of credit transactions and the reserve balance requirement at the Federal Reserve. 
    
  The following table shows our available liquidity, by source, as of the dates indicated: 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated   $14.0 million   of cash from operating activities, compared to   $21.8 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This   decrease   in cash flow was primarily the result of changes in working capital items largely related to timing of payments of accrued expenses. 
    
  Investing activities resulted in a net cash   outflow   of   $364.3 million  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net cash   outflow   of   $282.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   outflow  s for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were primarily due to   net loan growth   of   $332.0 million  , purchases of investment securities totaling   $33.7 million   and   $14.1 million   for the TKG acquisition net of acquired cash, partially offset by the proceeds, principal repayments and maturities from investment securities totaling   $16.4 million  .  The   outflow  s for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , included   net loan growth   of   $266.5 million   and purchases of investment securities totaling   $46.1 million  , partially offset by the proceeds, principal repayments and maturities from investment securities totaling   $33.8 million  .

     Table of Contents  

Financing activities resulted in a net   inflow   of   $374.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net   inflow   of   $255.3 million   for the same period in   2015  , as a result of the net increase in deposits of   $397.4 million   and a net decrease in FHLB borrowings of   $15.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a   $263.6 million   net increase in deposits and a net increase in FHLB borrowings of   $10.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  We continue to evaluate the potential impact on liquidity management by regulatory proposals, including those being established under the Dodd-Frank Act, as government regulators continue the final rule-making process. 

Capital Resources 
    
  The access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. 
    
  The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces.  We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence. 
    
  Shareholders  Equity.    Shareholders  equity   increased   to   $343.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $326.0 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The   $17.2 million     increase   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was attributable to net income of   $21.1 million  , the impact of   $2.7 million   in stock-based compensation, an   increase   of   $1.5 million   in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and   $1.4 million   in exercises of stock options, partially offset by the cancellation of stock options of   $5.2 million   and the purchase of   $4.3 million   in treasury stock. 
    
  Regulatory Capital.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. and TriState Capital Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and TriState Capital Bank was categorized as well capitalized for purposes of the FDIC s prompt corrective action regulations.  As we employ our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease.  However, we will monitor our capital in order to remain categorized as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory guidelines and in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us. 
    
  In December 2010, the Basel Committee released a final framework for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III.  In July 2013, final rules implementing the Basel III capital accord were adopted by the federal banking agencies.  Basel III, which began phasing in on January 1, 2015, has replaced the existing regulatory capital rules for the Company and the Bank.  The Basel III final rules required new minimum capital ratio standards, established a new common equity tier 1 to total risk-weighted assets ratio, subjected banking organizations to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and established a new standardized approach for risk weightings. 
    
  The following tables present the actual capital amounts and regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of the dates indicated: 

72 

     Table of Contents  

In addition, the final rules subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization does not maintain a capital conservation buffer of risk-based capital ratios in an amount greater than 2.5% of its total risk-weighted assets.  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount ratably on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  The following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations of principal, interest and expenses that may require future cash payments as of the date indicated. 

On October 19, 2016, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., which creates potential future obligations based on the estimated transaction value of between $11.5 million to $13.5 million, payable in 2018. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions that are not included in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with GAAP.  These transactions include commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business to approved customers. 
    
  Loan commitments are recorded on our financial statements as they are funded.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Loan commitments include unused commitments for open end lines secured by cash and marketable securities and residential properties, commitments to fund loans secured by commercial real estate, construction loans, business lines of credit and other unused commitments of loans in various stages of funding. 
    
  Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to  
  
   73 

     Table of Contents  

fund the commitment.  The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment.  If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. 
    
  We minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures.  The effect on our revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because, while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon.  There is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the total notional amount of unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding by contractual maturities outstanding as of the date indicated. 

Market Risk 
    
  Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices.  Our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility.  Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those that have a short term to maturity.  Because of the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk.  From time to time we do hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.  The summary information provided in this section should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
    
  Interest rate risk is comprised of re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.  Re-pricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or re-pricing between asset and liability portfolios.  Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indexes, which do not always change by the same amount or at the same time.  Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered.  Option risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans when rates fall, while certain depositors can redeem their certificates when rates rise. 
    
  Our ALCO actively measures and manages interest rate risk.  The ALCO is responsible for the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position.  This involves devising policy guidelines, risk measures and limits, and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. 
    
  We utilize an asset/liability model to measure and manage interest rate risk.  The specific measurement tools used by management on at least a quarterly basis include net interest income simulation, economic value of equity and gap analysis.  All are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business.  All are also measures of interest rate sensitivity used to help us develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk rather than projecting future earnings. 
    
  In our view, all three measures also have specific benefits and shortcomings.  Net interest income (     NII     ) simulation explicitly measures exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest but does not provide a long-term view.  Economic value of equity (     EVE     ) helps identify changes in optionality and price over a longer term horizon but its liquidation perspective does not convey the earnings-based measures that are typically the focus of managing and valuing a going concern.  Gap analysis compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to re-pricing over a period of time but only captures a single rate environment.  Reviewing these various measures collectively helps management obtain a comprehensive view of our interest risk rate profile. 

74 

     Table of Contents  

The following NII simulation and EVE metrics were calculated using rate shocks, which represent immediate rate changes that move all market rates by the same amount instantaneously.  The variance percentages represent the change between the NII simulation and EVE calculated under the particular rate scenario versus the NII simulation and EVE calculated assuming market rates as of the dates indicated. 

Given the relatively low current interest rate environment, it is our strategy to continue to manage an asset sensitive interest rate risk position in our net interest income measure and a near neutral interest rate risk position in our economic value of equity measure.  Therefore, rising rates are expected to have a positive effect on net interest income versus net interest income if rates remain unchanged.  The results of the EVE calculation indicate a relatively low level of interest rate risk regardless of the direction in which rates move. 

75 

     Table of Contents  

The following gap analysis presents the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that are subject to re-pricing within the periods indicated. 

The cumulative twelve-month ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities   increased   to   117.8%   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   111.0%   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Various loans across our portfolio have floating-rate index floors.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $26.6 million   in loans with a maturity greater than one year and an index floor rate greater than the current index rate.  Of this amount,   $19.7 million   have an index floor rate less than 100 basis points above the current index rate.  These loans are allocated to the less than 90 days maturity bucket in our gap analysis since we believe they would behave more like floating-rate loans given a 100 basis point upward shock in interest rates.  The remaining   $6.9 million   have an index floor rate greater than 100 basis points above the current index rate.  These loans are allocated to the one to three years maturity bucket in our gap analysis since we believe they would behave more like fixed-rate loans given a 100 basis point upward shock in interest rates. 
    
  In June 2016, the Company entered into a cash flow hedge derivative transaction to fix the interest rate on   $100.0 million   of the Company s borrowings for a period of three years.  This transaction has the effect on our gap analysis of moving   $100.0 million   of borrowings from the less than 90 day maturity bucket to one to three years.  For additional information on the cash flow hedge, refer to   Note 13, Derivatives and Hedging Activity  , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Additionally, in all of these analyses (NII, EVE and gap), we use what we believe is a conservative treatment of non-maturity, interest-bearing deposits.  In our gap analysis, the allocation of non-maturity, interest-bearing deposits is fully reflected in the less than 90 days maturity category.  The allocation of non-maturity, noninterest-bearing deposits is fully reflected in the non-sensitive category.  In taking this approach, we provide ourselves with no benefit to either NII or EVE from a potential time-lag in the rate increase of our non-maturity, interest-bearing deposits.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  From time to time the Company is a party to various litigation matters incidental to the conduct of its business.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company was not a party to any legal proceedings that the resolution of which management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, future prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows or capital levels. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
    
  There are risks, many beyond our control, that could cause our results to differ significantly from management s expectations.  Any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  , or in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
    
  The table below sets forth information regarding the Company s purchases of its common stock during its fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  : 

* 
    In January 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to $10 million, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The Board subsequently authorized the Company to utilize some of the $10 million allocated to the share repurchase program to cancel options granted by the Company to purchase shares of its common stock that expire in 2017 all of which have an exercise price of $10 per share.  In accordance with that authorization, in addition to the shares purchased as described in the above table, the Company and holders of options that expire in 2017 agreed to cancel options as set forth in the table below.  The approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase program in the above table has been reduced by the amount expended in connection with the option cancellations.  In October 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an additional share repurchase program of up to $5 million.  Under this authorization, purchases of shares may be made at the discretion of management from time to time in the open market or through negotiated transactions.  In addition, the funds allocated to the program can be used to cancel, in negotiated transactions, outstanding options expiring in 2017.  That program is not included in the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased in the above table.

  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 
  OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, James F. Getz, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The Registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a)

  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 
  OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, Mark L. Sullivan, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The Registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
       
           (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
