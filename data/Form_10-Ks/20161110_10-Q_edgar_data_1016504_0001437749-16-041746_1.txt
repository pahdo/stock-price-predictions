Note 1. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   

Basis of Presentation of Interim Financial Statements   

The accompanying  condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods are unaudited and include the accounts of Integrated BioPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ). The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and therefore do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. However, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results for the periods presented have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto, together with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 ( Form 10-K ), as filed with the SEC. The June 30, 2016 balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 or for any other period.  

Nature of Operations   

The  Company is engaged primarily in manufacturing, distributing, marketing and sales of vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products. The Company s customers are located primarily in the United States, Luxembourg and Canada. The Company was previously known as Integrated Health Technologies, Inc. and, prior to that, as Chem International, Inc. The Company was reincorporated in its current form in Delaware in 1995. The Company continues to do business as Chem International, Inc. with certain of its customers and certain vendors.   

The Company  s business segments include: (a) Contract Manufacturing operated by InB:Manhattan Drug Company, Inc. ( MDC ), which manufactures vitamins and nutritional supplements for sale to distributors, multilevel marketers and specialized health-care providers; (b) Branded Proprietary Products operated by AgroLabs, Inc. ( AgroLabs ), which distributes healthful nutritional products for sale through major mass market, grocery, drug and vitamin retailers, under the following brands: Naturally Noni, Coconut Water, Aloe Pure, Peaceful Sleep, Green Envy, ACAI Extra, ACAI Cleanse, Wheatgrass and other products which are being introduced into the market (these are referred to as our branded proprietary nutraceutical business and/or products); and (c) Other Nutraceutical Businesses which includes the operations of (i) The Vitamin Factory (the  Vitamin Factory ), which sells private label MDC products, as well as our AgroLabs products, through the Internet, (ii) IHT Health Products, Inc. ( IHT ) a distributor of fine natural botanicals, including multi minerals produced under a license agreement and (iii) Chem International, Inc. ( Chem ), a distributor of certain raw materials for DSM Nutritional Products LLC.  

Significant Accounting Policies   

There have been no material changes during fiscal  year 2017 in the Company s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  

Investment in iBio, Inc     .       The Company accounts for its investment in iBio, Inc. ( iBio ) common stock on the cost basis as it retained approximately 6% of its interest in iBio (1,266,706 common shares) (the  iBio Stock ) at the time of the spin-off of this subsidiary in August 2008.  The Company reviews its investment in iBio for impairment and records a loss when there is deemed to be a permanent impairment of the investment. To date, there were cumulative impairment charges of approximately $2.2 million. The market value of the iBio Stock as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $0.7 million based on the trade price at the close of trading on September 30, 2016.   

5

Pursuant to the Company  s Loan Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC ), the Company was required to sell the iBio Stock when the trading price of the iBio Stock is less than $0.88 per share for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days on the applicable exchange and utilize all proceeds from such sale to prepay the outstanding principal of the term loan outstanding under the Loan Agreement at such time. During certain periods beginning July 1, 2015 and fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the trading price of the iBio Stock was less than $0.88 for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days. Although PNC did not require the Company to sell shares of iBio Stock, the Company sold 73,191 shares of iBio Stock in the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  

On February 19, 2016, the Loan Agreement with PNC was amended. The amendment included the removal of the requirement to sell the iBio Stock based on the selling price of $0.88 per share; however, the requirement to use all the net proceeds from the sale of any of the iBio Stock to prepay the outstanding principal of the term loan outstanding under the Amended Loan Agreement remains.  (See Note 4. Senior Credit Facility, Subordinated Convertible Note, net - CD Financial, LLC and other Long Term Debt).  

Earnings Per Share.    Basic earnings per common share amounts are based on weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the incremental shares that would have been outstanding upon the assumed exercise of all potentially dilutive stock options, warrants and convertible debt, subject to anti-dilution limitations using the treasury stock method and if converted method.  

The following options and potentially dilutive shares  for convertible notes payable (See Note 4. Senior Credit Facility, Subordinated Convertible Note, net - CD Financial, LLC and other Long Term Debt) were not included in the computation of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding as the effect of doing so would be anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Note      2    . Inventories

Note      4    .     Senior Credit Facility, Subordinated Convertible Note, net - CD Financial, LLC and other Long Term Debt    

As of  September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had the following debt outstanding:  

SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY  

On February 19, 2016, the Company, MDC, AgroLabs, IHT, IHT Properties Corp. ( IHT Properties ) and Vitamin Factory (collectively, the  Borrowers ) amended the Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (the  Amended Loan Agreement ) with PNC Bank, National Association as agent and lender ( PNC ) and the other lenders party thereto entered into on June 27, 2012. 

The Amended Loan Agreement provides for a total of $11,422 in senior secured financing (the  Senior Credit Facility ) as follows: (i) discretionary advances ( Revolving Advances ) based on eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory in the maximum amount of $8,000 (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and (ii) a term loan in the amount of $3,422 (the  Term Loan ). The Senior Credit Facility is secured by all assets of the Borrowers, including, without limitation, machinery and equipment, real estate owned by IHT Properties, and common stock of iBio owned by the Company. Revolving Advances bear interest at PNC  s Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate, at Borrowers  option, plus 2.75% (3.50% as of September 30 and June 30, 2016). The Term Loan bears interest at PNC s Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate, at Borrowers  option, plus 3.25% (4.00% as of September 30 and June 30, 2016). Upon and after the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement, and during the continuation thereof, interest shall be payable at the interest rate then applicable plus 2%. The Senior Credit Facility matures on February 19, 2020 (the  Senior Maturity Date ).   

8

The principal balance of the Revolving Advances is payable on the Senior Maturity Date, subject to acceleration, based upon a material adverse event clause, as defined, subjective accelerations for borrowing base reserves, as defined or upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement or earlier termination of the Amended Loan Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Term Loan shall be repaid in eighty-four (84) consecutive monthly installments of principal, the first eighty-three (83) of which shall be in the amount of $41, commencing on the first business day of March, 2016, and continuing on the first business day of each month thereafter, with a final payment of any unpaid balance of principal and interest payable on the Senior Maturity Date. The foregoing is subject to customary mandatory prepayment provisions and acceleration upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement or earlier termination of the Amended Loan Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. 

The Revolving Advances are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Loan Agreement and are made in aggregate amounts at any time equal to the lesser of (x) $8.0 million or (y) an amount equal to the sum of: (i) up to 85%, subject to the provisions in the Amended Loan Agreement, of eligible accounts receivables ( Receivables Advance Rate ), plus (ii) up to the lesser of (A) 75%, subject to the provisions in the Amended Loan Agreement, of the value of the eligible inventory ( Inventory Advance Rate  and together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the  Advance Rates ), (B) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (as evidenced by the most recent inventory appraisal reasonably satisfactory to PNC in its sole discretion exercised in good faith) and (C) the inventory sublimit in the aggregate at any one time ( Inventory Advance Rate  and together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the  Advance Rates ), minus (iii) the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, minus (iv) such reserves as PNC may reasonably deem proper and necessary from time to time. 

The Amended Loan Agreement contains customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including, without limitation the requirement to use any sales proceeds from the sale of iBio Stock to repay the Term Loan and to prepay the outstanding amount of the  Revolving Advances in an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, payable upon delivery of the financial statements to PNC referred to in and required by the Amended Loan Agreement for such fiscal year but in any event not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each such fiscal year, which amount shall be applied ratably to the outstanding principal installments of the Term Loan in the inverse order of the maturities thereof. The Amended Loan Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including, without limitation, (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio maintenance requirement and (ii) an event of default tied to any change of control as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio maintenance requirement.   

The Loan Agreement (prior to giving effect to the February 19, 2016 amendment described above) required the Company to sell iBio Stock if the per share price fell below $0.88. This requirement is not in the Amended Loan Agreement, however, the requirement to use all the net proceeds from the sale of any of the iBio Stock to prepay the outstanding principal of the term loan outstanding under the Amended Loan Agreement remains a requirement under the Amended Loan Agreement. During certain periods in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 and continuing through the nine months ended March 31, 2016, the trading price of the iBio Stock was less than $0.88 for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days. However, PNC temporarily waived the requirement to sell the iBio Stock due to certain trading rules and restrictions under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Although not required to sell the iBio Stock by PNC, in the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the Company sold 73,191 shares of iBio Stock. 

9

In connection with the Senior Credit Facility, PNC and CD Financial entered into the Intercreditor and Subordination Agreement (the  Intercreditor Agreement ), which was acknowledged by the Borrowers, pursuant to which, among other things, (a) the lien of CD Financial on assets of the Borrowers is subordinated to the lien of PNC on such assets during the effectiveness of the Senior Credit Facility, and (b) priorities for payment of the debt for the Company and its subsidiar ies (as described in this Note 4) are established.  

In addition, in connection with the Senior Credit Facility, the following loan documents were executed: (i) a Stock Pledge Agreement with PNC, pursuant to which the Company pledged to PNC the iBio Stock; (ii) a Mortgage and Security Agreement with PNC with IHT Properties; and (iii) an Environmental Indemnity Agreement with PNC. 

CD FINANCIAL, LLC TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING  

On June 27, 2012, the Company also entered into an Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement (the  CD SPA ) with CD Financial, which amend ed and restated the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2008, between the Company and CD Financial, pursuant to which the Company issued to CD Financial a 9.5% Convertible Senior Secured Note in the original principal amount of $4,500 (the  Original CD Note ). Pursuant to the CD SPA, the Company issued to CD Financial (i) the Amended and Restated Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $5,350 (the  CD Convertible Note ) and (ii) the Promissory Note in the principal amount of $1,714 (the  Liquidity Note , and collectively with the CD Convertible Note, the  CD Notes ). The CD Notes had an original maturity date of July 7, 2017, however, on February 19, 2016, the CD Notes were amended to extend the maturity date thereof to February 29, 2020.  

The proceeds of the CD Notes were used to refinance (a) the Original CD Note, (b) the  CD MDC Note which was assigned by MDC to the Company, (c) past due interest in the aggregate amount of $333 and (d) other expenses owed to CD Financial by the Company in the aggregate amount of approximately $217.  

The CD Notes are secured by all assets of the Borrowers, including, without limitation, machinery and equipment, real estate owned by IHT  Properties, and iBio Stock owned by the Company. The CD Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 6% and have a default rate of 10%.

Note  5. Significant Risks and Uncertainties    

(     a    ) Major Customers.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 91% and 87%, respectively of consolidated net sales, were derived from two customers. These two customers are in the Company s Contract Manufacturing Segment and represent approximately 48% and 47% each of this Segment s net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A third customer in the Branded Nutraceutical Segment, while not a significant customer of the Company s consolidated net sales, represented approximately 67% and 77% of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of the Branded Nutraceutical Segment. Accounts receivable from these two major customers represented approximately 87% of total net accounts receivable as of September 30 and June 30, 2016.  The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse affect on the Company s operations. Major customers are those customers who account for more than 10% of net sales.   

(     b    ) Other Business Risks.   Approximately 66% of the Company s employees are covered by a union contract and are employed in its New Jersey facilities. The contract was renewed on September 1, 2015 and will expire on August 31, 2018.  

Note  6. Commitments and Contingencies    

(a) Leases   

Related Party Leases.    Warehouse and office facilities are leased from Vitamin Realty, which is 100% owned by the Company s chairman, Chief Executive Officer and major stockholder and certain of his family members, who are also executive officers and directors of the Company. On January 5, 2012, MDC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a second amendment of lease (the  Second Lease Amendment ) with Vitamin Realty for its office and warehouse space in New Jersey increasing its rentable square footage from an aggregate of 74,898 square feet to 76,161 square feet and extending the expiration date to January 31, 2026. This Second Lease Amendment provides for minimum annual rental payments of $533, plus increases in real estate taxes and building operating expenses. On May 19, 2014, AgroLabs entered into an Amendment to the lease agreement entered into on January 5, 2012, with Vitamin Realty for an additional 2,700 square feet of warehouse space in New Jersey, the term of which was to expire on January 31, 2019 to extend the expiration date to January 1, 2024. This additional lease provides for minimum lease payments of $27 with annual increases plus the proportionate share of operating expenses.  

Rent expense for the  three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on these leases were $197 and $184 respectively, and are included in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had an outstanding obligation to Vitamin Realty of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and long term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Other Lease Commitments.    The Company has entered into certain non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring up through January 31, 2026, related to office and warehouse space, equipment and vehicles (inclusive of the related party lease with Vitamin Realty).   

12

The minimum rental commitment s for long-term non-cancelable leases are as follows:  

Total rent expense, including real estate taxes and maintenance charges, was approximately  $237 and $225 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense is included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

(     b    ) Legal Proceedings.     

The Company is subject, from time to time, to claims by third parties under various legal theories. The defense of such claims, or any adverse outcome relating to any such claims, could have a material adverse effect on the Company  s liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.   

(c) Other Claims.          

On May 15, 2012, Cedarburg Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Cedarburg ) sent the Company a letter (the  Demand Letter ) setting forth a demand for indemnification under the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 17, 2009 (the  Cedarburg SPA ), by and among Cedarburg, InB: Hauser Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., InB: Paxis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company. In the Demand Letter, Cedarburg demanded payment by the Company of $0.6 million in respect of the Company s indemnification obligations under the Cedarburg SPA. In addition, in the Demand Letter, Cedarburg informed the Company that there are also environmental issues pending which may lead to additional costs to Cedarburg which will likely be in excess of $ 0.3 million.   

On May 30, 2012, the Company sent a letter responding to the Demand Letter and setting forth the Company  s position that it has no obligation to indemnify Cedarburg as demanded. On June 18, 2012, Cedarburg responded to the Company s letter and, on July 27, 2012, the Company sent another letter to Cedarburg reiterating its position that the Company has no obligation to indemnify Cedarburg as demanded. On December 18, 2012, Cedarburg responded to the Company s letter and, on January 15, 2013, the Company sent another letter to Cedarburg reiterating its position that the Company has no obligation to indemnify Cedarburg as demanded. As of November 10, 2016, the Company has not received any further communication from Cedarburg with respect to its demand for indemnification as set forth in the Demand Letter. The Company intends to vigorously contest Cedarburg s demand as set forth in the Demand Letter.

Note  8. Segment Information    

The basis for presenting segment results generally is consistent with overall Company reporting. The Company reports information about its operating segments in accordance with GAAP which establishes standards for reporting information about a company  s operating segments.   

The Company has divided its operations into three reportable segments as follows: Contract Manufacturing,  Branded Proprietary Products and Other Nutraceutical Businesses. The international sales, concentrated primarily in Europe and Canada, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,876 and $1,992, respectively.

Item 2.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANICAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION     

Certain statements set forth under this caption constitute  forward-looking statements.  See  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  on page 1 of this  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional factors relating to such statements. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and Notes thereto included herein and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  

The Company is engaged primarily in the manufacturing, distributing, marketing and sales of vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products.  The Company s customers are located primarily in the United States, Luxembourg and Canada.  

Business Outlook   

Our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this MD A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, pending divestitures, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross margin and costs, the tax rate, and potential legal proceedings. We are focusing our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may have an impact on expense levels and gross margin. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from our expectations. See the risks described in  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

For the three months ended  September 30, 2016, our net sales from operations increased by $3.3 million to approximately $12.7 million from approximately $9.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Substantially all the increase in net sales was from the Contract Manufacturing Segment ($1.7 million from each of our significant customers, Herbalife and Life Extension), our other two segments had offsetting increases and decreases in net sales. While we are pleased with this substantial increase year over year, the increase in sales from Herbalife and to a lesser extent Life Extension, was the result of filling back orders from the prior fiscal quarter and is not necessarily indicative of future growth for these customers. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 we had operating income of approximately $1.4 million, an increase of approximately $0.9 million from the three months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $0.5 million. Our profit margins increased from approximately 14% of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 17% of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of increased weighted gross margins in our Contract Manufacturing Segment of approximately 4%. This improvement was the direct result of the increased sales while our fixed manufacturing costs remaining substantially the same in the year over year reporting period. We maintained our consolidated selling and administrative expenses at approximately $0.8 million in each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies in the  three months ended September 30, 2016. Critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with them are regularly discussed by management with our Audit Committee. Those policies are discussed under  Critical Accounting Policies  in our  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.

Results of Operations 

Our results from operations in the following table, sets forth the income statement data of our results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated: 

For the      Three Months Ended         September 30, 2016     compared to the     Three Months Ended         September 30, 2015    

Sales, net.       Sales, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $12.7 million and $9.4 million, respectively, an increase of 34.3%, and are comprised of the following:  

16

For the three  months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, approximately 91% and 87%, respectively, were concentrated among two customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment, Herbalife and Life Extensions. Herbalife and Life Extensions represented approximately 48% and 47% each of our Contract Manufacturing Segment s net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Costco Wholesale Corporation ( Costco ) (a customer of our Branded Proprietary Products Segment), while not a significant customer of our consolidated net sales represented approximately 67% and 77% of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively of the Branded Propriety Products Segment.   

The  increase in net sales of approximately $3.2 million was primarily the result of:  

Net sales  increased in our Contract Manufacturing Segment by $3.3 million primarily due to increased sales volumes to Herbalife and Life Extension in the three months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $1.7 million each in the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

Net sales in our Branded Nutraceutical Segment  decreased by approximately $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as the result of decreased sales of $83,000 to Costco resulting from pricing pressures from the strong US Dollar versus the Canadian Dollar. The decreased sales was offset, in part, by the release of an estimated sales allowance of approximately $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, for a customer the Company has not done business with in the past five years with no such release in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Net sales in our  Other Nutraceutical segments increased by $0.1 million primarily as a result of increased sales to customers of IHT Health Products of its multi mineral products.   

Cost    of sales.  Cost of sales increased by $2.4 million to $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 or approximately 30%. Cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales to 83.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 86.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the cost of goods sold amount is consistent with the increased net sales of approximately 34%. The decrease in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, was primarily the result of the increased sales of $3.3 million in the Contracting Manufacturing Segment resulting in the absorption of the fixed manufacturing overhead costs of this segment. There were no significant changes in the cost of goods sold in our other two segments.   

Selling and Administrative Expenses.   There was a slight decrease in selling and administrative expenses of $37,000 or approximately 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of sales, net, selling and administrative expenses was approximately 6.3% and 8.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily from decreased marketing of approximately $29,000 in our Branded Nutraceutical Segment. Amortization and depreciation expense decreased by approximately $12,000 primarily as the result of certain intangible assets and fixed assets being fully amortized or depreciated ($7,000 and $8,500, respectively) in the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting in no such amortization or depreciation expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  These decreases were offset by an increase in salaries and employees benefits of approximately $21,000 or 4.1%, as the result of increasing our administrative staff by one person. All other components of our selling and administrative expenses decreased an aggregate amount of $17,000 primarily from lower professional fee costs.   

17

Other income (expense)   , net.  Other income (expense), net was approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and is composed of:  

The variance in the  change in fair value of derivative liabilities from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the September 30, 2016 was mainly the result of the increased volatility in the closing trading price of our common stock from 63.2% as of June 30, 2016 to 98.3% as of September 30, 2016 as well as the change in the closing price from $0.11 to $0.15. As noted above, there was not a significant change in the estimated fair value of derivative instruments from June 30, 2015 to September 30, 2015. The volatility of the closing trading price of our stock and the closing trading price are two of the variables used to calculate the estimated fair value of our derivative liabilities associated with the underlying derivative instrument. The other components of other income (expense) were not significant and did not vary significantly from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

Federal and state income tax, net.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had federal and state income tax expense of approximately $126 and $28, respectively. We continue to maintain a full reserve on our deferred tax assets as it has been determined that based upon past losses, the Company s past liquidity concerns and the current economic environment, that it is  more likely than not  the Company s deferred tax assets may not be realized. The state income tax expense is the result of MDC using all of its state net operating losses in the fiscal year ended 2013 tax period. All of our other subsidiaries still have adequate net operating losses for state income tax purposes to absorb any taxable income for state tax purposes.  

Net    income  .  Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $0.4 million was primarily the result of our increased operating income of $0.9 million offset by the change in fair value of derivative instruments of approximately $0.4 million.  

Seasonality   

The nutraceutical business tends to be seasonal. We have found that in our first fiscal quarter ending on  September 30th of each year, orders for our branded proprietary nutraceutical products usually slow (absent the addition of new customers or a new product launch with a significant first time order), as buyers in various markets may have purchased sufficient inventory to carry them through the summer months. Conversely, in our second fiscal quarter, ending on December 31st of each year, orders for our products increase as the demand for our branded nutraceutical products, as well as sales orders from our customers in our contract manufacturing segment, seem to increase in late December to early January as consumers become health conscious as they enter the new year.   

The Company believes that there are other non-seasonal factors that also may influence the variability of quarterly results including, but not limited to, general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending, changing consumer demands and current news on nutritional supplements. Accordingly, a comparison of the Company  s results of operations from consecutive periods is not necessarily meaningful, and the Company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future periods.  

18

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Company  s net cash flows used in operating, investing and financing activities, its period end cash and cash equivalents and other operating measures:  

At  September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, our working capital was approximately $0.9 and $0.2 million, respectively. Our current assets increased by $0.6 million and current liabilities were substantially the same, resulting in a net increase in our working capital of $0.7 million.  

Net cash  used in operating activities of $0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, includes net income of approximately $0.6 million. After excluding the effects of non-cash expenses, including depreciation and amortization, and changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities, the adjusted cash provided from operations before the effect of the changes in working capital components was $1.1 million. Net cash used in our operations from our working capital assets and liabilities in the amount of approximately $1.6 million was primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively and from a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $0.7 million.  

Net cash provided by operating activities of $0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, includes net income of approximately  $0.2 million. After excluding the effects of non-cash expenses, including depreciation and amortization, and changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities, the adjusted cash provided from operations before the effect of the changes in working capital components was $0.4 million. Net cash provided by our operations from our working capital assets and liabilities in the amount of approximately $32,000 was primarily the result of increases in inventories of $0.3 million and $0.2 million in accounts receivable and offset, in part, by a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $0.5 million.  

Cash used in investing activities was used for the purchas e of machinery and equipment of approximately $41,000 in each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Cash provided from financing activities was approximately  $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, $12.6 million from advances under our revolving credit facility offset, in part, by repayments of advances under our revolving credit facility of $11.9 million and principal under our term note in the amount of $0.4 million. Cash used in financing activities was approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, $8.8 million for repayments of advances under our revolving credit facility and $0.1 million from repayments of principal under our term notes payable offset, in part, by advances of $8.5 million of proceeds received under our revolving credit facility.  

As of  September 30, 2016, we had cash of $92,000, funds available under our revolving credit facility of approximately $1.1 million and working capital of approximately $0.9 million. Our working capital includes $4.9 million outstanding under our revolving line of credit which is not due until February 2020 but classified as current due to a subjective acceleration clause that could cause the advances to become currently due. (See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Furthermore, we had income from operations of approximately $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016. After taking into consideration our interim results and current projections, management believes that operations, together with the revolving credit facility will support our working capital requirements through the period ending September 30, 2017.   

19

Our total annual commitments at  September 30, 2016 for long term non-cancelable leases of approximately $587,000 consists of obligations under operating leases for facilities and operating lease agreements for the rental of warehouse equipment, office equipment and automobiles.  

On May 15, 2012, Cedarburg Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Cedarburg ) sent us a letter (the  Demand Letter ) setting forth a demand for indemnification under the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 17, 2009 (the  Cedarburg SPA ), by and among Cedarburg, InB: Hauser Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., InB: Paxis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company. In the Demand Letter, Cedarbur g demanded payment by us of $0.6 million in respect of the Company s indemnification obligations under the Cedarburg SPA. In addition, in the Demand Letter, Cedarburg informed us that there are also environmental issues pending which may lead to additional costs to Cedarburg which will likely be in excess of $0.3 million.   

On May 30, 2012, we sent a letter responding to the Demand Letter and setting forth our position that we have no obligation to indemnify Cedarburg as demanded. On June 18, 2012, Cedarburg responded to our letter and, on July 27, 2012, we sent another letter to Cedarburg reiterating our position that  we have no obligation to indemnify Cedarburg as demanded. On December 18, 2012, Cedarburg responded to our letter and, on January 15, 2013, we sent another letter to Cedarburg reiterating our position that we have no obligation to indemnify Cedarburg as demanded. As of November 10, 2016, we have not received any further communication from Cedarburg with respect to its demand for indemnification as set forth in the Demand Letter. We intend to vigorously contest Cedarburg s demand as set forth in the Demand Letter.
