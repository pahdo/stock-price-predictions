  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
   Organization   
   
 Talon Real Estate Holding Corp. ( TREHC ) previously established an Operating Partnership ( Talon OP ) and transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the operating partnership in exchange for general partnership units.  As the sole general partner of Talon OP we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business and affairs for the operating partnership.  TREHC owned approximately 66% and 65% of the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Operating Partnership owned 49% of 5130 Industrial Street, LLC, 100% of Talon Bren Road, LLC, 100% of Talon First Trust, LLC, and 100% of Talon RE as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Talon Bren Road, LLC, and Talon First Trust, LLC both limited liability companies organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, were formed on May 9, 2014 and April 21, 2014, respectively, to purchase real estate. Talon Real Estate, LLC ( Talon RE ) was incorporated in the state of Minnesota on December 20, 2012 and began operations in 2013 for the purpose of acquiring real estate properties. 
   
   Basis of Presentation   
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable.  These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. 
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TREHC and its interest in the Operating Partnership. The limited partners in the Operating Partnership have a redemption option that they may exercise. Upon exercise of the redemption option by the limited partners, the Company has the choice of redeeming the limited partners' interests ( Units ) for TREHC common shares of stock on a one-for-one basis, or making a cash payment to the unit holder.   The redemption generally may be exercised by the limited partners at any time after the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition of the Units subject to volume restrictions. 
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, which have previously been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted from this report on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
   
 The results for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of future financial results. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm.

  NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Accounting Estimates   
   
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include determination of the useful life of property and other long-lived assets, valuation and impairment analysis of property and other long-lived assets, and valuation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates could change in the near term. 
   
   Principles of Consolidation   
   
 We evaluate the need to consolidate affiliates based on standards set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810, Consolidation.  In determining whether we have a controlling interest in an affiliate and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions, contractual and substantive participating rights of the limited partners and shareholders, as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Talon Real Estate Holding Corp. ( TREHC ) and Talon OP, our Operating Partnership, and all subsidiaries in which it maintains a controlling interest.  Talon OP also consolidates 5130 LLC, an entity in which it has a 49% ownership interest, based on its ability to control the operating and financial decisions of 5130 LLC.  All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
   Cash   
   
 The Company considers short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash. 
   
   Restricted Escrows and Reserves   
   
 The Company is required to hold cash in restricted escrow accounts for insurance, real estate taxes and a replacement reserve. The escrows are used to pay periodic charges of real estate taxes and assessments, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. The balances in the escrow accounts were $3,175,992 and $2,139,180 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  
   
   Rents and other Receivables   
   
 Rents receivable and deferred rent are recorded at their estimated net realizable value. The Company follows a policy of providing an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based on a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. The Company does not require collateral and accounts are considered past due if payment is not made on a timely basis in accordance with our credit terms. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off. Receivables have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts of $129,330 and $93,560 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 Base rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease agreement, inclusive of leases which provide for scheduled rent increases or rent concessions. Differences between rent income earned and base rent amounts due per the respective lease agreements are credited or charged to deferred rent revenue or deferred rent receivable as applicable.  When the Company enters into lease modifications or extensions with current tenants, the deferred rent at the time of the extension is amortized over the remaining term of the lease, and the revised terms are considered a new lease. 
   
 Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are billed monthly based on current year estimated operating costs for applicable expenses.  An additional billing or a refund is made to tenants in the following year after actual operating expenses are determined. 
   
   Derivative Instruments   
   
 The Company records all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  If the Company does not apply hedge accounting, all changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized directly in earnings in the period of change.  Currently, the Company has not elected hedge accounting treatment and all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized in current period earnings. 
   
   Deferred Leasing Costs and Tenant Allowance   
   
 Direct and indirect costs, including estimated internal costs and leasing commissions, associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by the Company are capitalized as deferred leasing costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease as amortization expense.  Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease. Costs associated with unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed.

  NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  
   
   Deferred Leasing Costs and Tenant Allowance (continued)   
   
 In leasing tenant space, the Company may provide funding to the lessee through a tenant allowance. In accounting for a tenant allowance, the Company determines whether the allowance represents funding for the construction of leasehold improvements and evaluates the ownership, for accounting purposes, of such improvements. If the Company is considered the owner of the leasehold improvements for accounting purposes, the Company capitalizes the amount of the tenant allowance as building improvements and depreciates it over the shorter of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the related lease term.  For tenant allowances committed at lease inception and recorded as building improvements but not yet performed or completed, the corresponding liability will be recorded as tenant improvement allowance payables.  If the tenant allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, for accounting purposes, the tenant allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is capitalized as a deferred leasing cost and is amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis. The Company had amortization expense for tenant allowances of $260,552 and $793,279 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $272,852 and $779,461 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The Company had accumulated amortization for tenant allowances of $2,620,180 and $1,826,901 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company had amortization expense for deferred leasing costs of $73,320 and $220,302 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $79,682 and $232,788 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The Company had accumulated amortization for deferred leasing costs of $704,323 and $484,021 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had deferred leasing costs and tenant allowances recorded as building improvements of $11,532,029 that did not have amortization expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to lease terms that have not commenced as of that date. 
   
   Deferred Financing Costs   
   
 Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are netted against notes payable and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the financing term and are included in interest expense. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $103,090 and $450,614, respectively, related to deferred financing costs associated with unsuccessful refinancing efforts. The Company had amortization expense of $121,094 and $433,475 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $325,531 and $875,285 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The Company had accumulated amortization of $1,936,370 and $1,502,895 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   
   Real Estate Property and Fixed Assets   
   
 Investment in real estate and fixed assets with a useful life of longer than one year are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property such as land, building and improvements includes cost of acquisitions, development, and construction and tenant allowances and improvements. We allocate the cost of an acquisition, including the assumption of liability, to the acquired tangible assets (including land, buildings and personal property) determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and identifiable intangibles based on their relative fair values.  Acquisitions of real estate are recorded based upon preliminary allocations of the purchase price to management s assessment of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and any assumed liabilities acquired which are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained up to one year after the date of acquisition. Management s fair value assessment includes the use of readily accepted fair value techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and comparable sales analysis including management s reliance on independent market analysis.

 As of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) 
   
  NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  
   
   Real Estate Property and Fixed Assets (continued)   
   
 Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets for buildings and land improvements, and the term of the lease for tenant improvements. The estimated useful lives being used are as follows: 

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, whereas expenditures that improve or extend the service lives of assets are capitalized. Disposal and abandonment of improvements are recognized at occurrence as a charge to depreciation. 
   
   Intangible Assets or Liabilities   
   
 Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets and any significant intangible assets and liabilities (such as above- and below-market leases and value of acquired in-place leases), and any assumed liabilities, and allocates the purchase price based on these fair value assessments. The Company records intangible assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value apart from goodwill for acquisitions of real estate. The Company amortizes identified intangible assets and liabilities based on the period over which the assets and liabilities are expected to affect the future cash flows of the real estate property acquired. Lease intangibles (such as in-place or above- and below-market leases) are amortized over the term of the related lease.  Above and below-market leases are amortized as a reduction in (addition to) rent revenue.     The Company amortized $45,220 and $138,709 to rent revenue for above and below-market leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $48,415 and $166,954 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.    Amortization of other intangibles is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. 
   
   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   
   
 Long-lived assets, such as real estate property, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.  An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for either of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 
   
   Income Taxes   
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740-10-30 which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary differences and carry forwards are expected to reverse. Accounting standards require the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is  more likely than not  that some component or all of the benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
   
 The Company's policy of accounting for uncertain tax positions is to recognize the tax effects from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized, upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.  The Company has examined the tax positions taken in its tax returns and determined that there are no uncertain tax positions. As a result, the Company has recorded no uncertain tax liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet.

   Income Taxes (continued)   
   
 The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2012. The Company is not currently under examination by any taxing jurisdiction. In the event of any future tax assessments, the Company has elected to record the income tax penalties as general and administrative expense and any related interest as interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
   
   Stock-based Compensation   
   
 The Company has granted restricted stock to employees under an approved employee equity incentive plan and to Directors under a director compensation plan. Granted shares are considered issued and outstanding as of the date of the grants. Stock-based compensation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is valued at the fair value on the date of the grant.  The Company has recognized $145,150 and $342,720 of compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $38,285 and $135,685 of compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
   
 The Company may also issue common stock in exchange for goods or services of non-employees.  These shares are either fully vested at date of grant or vest over a certain period during which services are provided.  The Company expenses the fair market value of the services over the period in which they are received. 
   
 On February 10, 2015, the Company issued 460,000 shares of common stock valued at $575,000 to an unrelated party in exchange for such party s guaranty of a loan which was obtained in the year ended December 31, 2015.  The value of the stock issued has been included as deferred financing costs in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Financing costs of $0 and $47,917 related to this stock issuance were amortized to interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $143,750 and $383,333 for the three and nine months ended September, 30 2015, respectively. 
   
   Noncontrolling Interest   
   
 Interests in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners are represented by partnership common units of the Operating Partnership. The Company's interest in the Operating Partnership was 66.0% and 65.0% of the common units of the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Operating Partnership s income is allocated to holders of units based upon the ratio of their holdings to the total units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, syndication costs, and profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in accordance with the terms of the Operating Partnership agreement. 
   
 The portion of membership interests in 5130 LLC not held by Talon OP is reported as noncontrolling interest.  Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interest based on membership percentages and terms of the operating agreement. 
   
   Net Income (Loss) or Earnings Per Share   
   
 Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common and potential dilutive common shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury stock method.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This new standard will eliminate all industry-specific guidance and replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on the topic. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Lease contracts are specifically excluded from the new accounting guidance.  This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).  The amendments in this Update provide guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.  The Company currently has disclosed certain matters relative to going concern in Note 15 but presently has not yet adopted the new guidance. 
   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.     We adopted the accounting standards update as of January 1, 2016 with retrospective application to our December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effect of the adoption was to reclassify debt issuance from deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, of $969,527 to a contra account as a deduction from the related notes payable.  There was no effect on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.

  NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)   
   
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, ASU 2015 16 requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The provisions of ASU 2015 16 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-16 had no impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets or results of operations, or cash flows. 
   
 During February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU No. 2016-02 was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined). ASU No. 2016-02 is not expected to significantly impact the accounting for leases by lessors.  ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.  Upon adoption, the lessee will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which will reduce complexity in accounting standards related to share-based payment transactions, including, among others, (1) accounting for income taxes, (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flow, (3) forfeitures, and (4) statutory tax withholding requirements.  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  NOTE 4   TENANT LEASES

(1) 
 Beginning January 2016, mechanics lien statements were filed upon the property at 180 E. Fifth Street for work completed to prepare the tenant space for a significant lease entered into on April 9, 2015.      Mechanics liens that remain undischarged of record after 60 days constitute an event of default under the loan agreements, permitting the lender to accelerate the indebtedness at its option.  On September 21, 2016 and October 20, 2016, mechanics lien holders filed a summons and complaint in the State of Minnesota claiming that the Company breached its obligations to which the Company has responded. At this time, the Company is unable to determine the outcome of, and therefore has not recorded any obligations with respect to this dispute.    The lender is aware of this default and our refinancing efforts to cure it.  They are currently not exercising any remedies with respect to any defaults. 
 (2) 
 On November 16, 2015 the Company entered into a $481,934 unsecured promissory note with the Property Manager of Talon First Trust, LLC. The note satisfied the fees due under the Property Management Agreement for the period of March 2015 through December 2015 and had an original maturity date of December 31, 2015.  Subsequently, the Company extended the maturity date to February 15, 2016 and then to August 31, 2016 and increased the note by $471,974 for the fees incurred from January 2016 through July 2016 and interest incurred through May 31, 2016 per the terms of the promissory notes and Property Management Agreement entered into with the Property Manager (see Note 9).

On September 21, 2016, and subsequently as amended on September 22, 2016, the Property Manager filed a summons and complaint in the State of Minnesota claiming that the Company breached its obligation under the notes to which the Company has responded.   At this time, the Company is unable to determine the outcome of, and therefore has not recorded any obligations with respect to this dispute.

The loan agreement allows the Company 30 days following any failure in which to satisfy this financial covenant or provide an individual or entity acceptable to lender as another guarantor on the loan and of the environmental indemnity obligations. Failure to satisfy the covenant would constitute an event of default under the terms of the loan.  The Company (as well as Talon OP, L.P.) is a guarantor of the loan entered into by Talon First Trust, LLC and an indemnitor of Talon First Trust, LLC s environmental obligations in connection with the property at 180 E.

There is no assurance that the financial covenants will be satisfied in the future.  As such, the Company has included the full outstanding balance of the loan in the principal amounts due in 2016 in the table above.

On April 1, 2016, the tenant provided notice asserting a right to terminate the lease based on certain alleged defaults related to the completion and delivery of the building and tenant improvements under the lease On June 1, 2016, the tenant filed a summons and complaint in the State of Minnesota claiming that the Company breached its obligation under the lease and asserting certain rights to terminate the lease.  The Company has responded to the complaint to enforce the lease.  At this time, the Company is unable to determine the outcome of, and therefore has not recorded any obligations with respect to this dispute. 
   
 On August 31, 2015, the Company amended a lease arrangement with an existing tenant.  As part of the lease agreement, the Company incurred an obligation for lease incentives up to approximately $252,000.  On June 30, 2016, the Company reversed the remaining balance of $210,300 of deferred leasing incentives and corresponding payable as the tenant cancelled the leasing incentive offered in the lease. The Company had recorded leasing incentives payable of $0 and $235,500, within accrued expenses and other liabilities related to this commitment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   
  NOTE 10   RESTRICTED STOCK

NOTE 12   HEDGING ACTIVITIES  
   
 The Company may use derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management strategy to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from variable interest rates associated with existing borrowings.  On July 2, 2014, the Company entered into an interest rate cap contract for the notional amount of $33 million with a strike rate of 2.5% on one month LIBOR as a hedge for a floating rate debt entered into on that date.  The interest rate cap expired on July 5, 2016.  The interest rate cap was issued at approximate market terms and thus no fair value adjustment was recorded at inception.  The Company did not elect hedge accounting treatment for the rate cap and as such, changes in fair value are recorded directly to earnings. 
   
  NOTE 13   MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS  
   
 On July 2, 2014, the Company issued 30,000 preferred units, at a price of $100 per unit, totaling $3,000,000.  These preferred unit holders are entitled to distributions at a rate of 6% per annum of their liquidation preference amount of $100 per unit which are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable monthly (to the extent there are sufficient distributable proceeds).  On and after July 2, 2020, the Company shall redeem the units, in whole, at the liquidation preference price of $100 per unit, plus accrued and unpaid distributions.  There was $100,005 of preferred payments outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  The preferred units have been classified as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet as the preferred liquidation preference amount is mandatorily redeemable in specific amounts at specific dates in the future.  The liquidation preference amount totaled $3,000,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) 
   
      NOTE 15   GOING CONCERN  
   
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our operations and assets, acquire properties, make distributions to our shareholders and other general business needs. In the short-term, we have incurred significant expenses related to completing building and tenant improvements at our properties, and pursuing our acquisition strategy creating a cash shortfall through September 30, 2016. 
   
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds needed to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, pay off maturing debt, and to pursue our strategy of near-term growth through acquisition of properties as well as general and administrative expenses operating as a public company. 
   
 We currently do not have available cash and cash flows from current operations to provide us with adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future. Our current liabilities exceed our unrestricted cash and we have very limited cash flow from current operations.  As of September 30, 2016, we had unrestricted cash of $184,332 and current liabilities including tenant improvement allowances, unsecured debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses substantially in excess of the available cash.  We therefore will require additional capital and/or increased cash flow from future operations to fund our ongoing business .  The loan secured by the property at 180 E. Fifth Street may be accelerated by the lender which would require refinancing or sale of the property.   We may also be unable to borrow or obtain sufficient funds for repayment on terms acceptable to us or at all, and our ability to obtain future financing may also be impacted negatively.  
   
 There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any required additional capital or generate sufficient cash flow from our current and future operations to fund our ongoing business. If the amount of capital we are able to raise together with our income from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to cease our operations or alter our growth plans.  If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. 
   
 Although we plan to aggressively pursue acquisitions to grow our business there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional properties in the future or obtain the necessary financing to acquire such properties. 
   
 Since our available cash and cash flows from current operations do not provide us with adequate cash to satisfy current liabilities and do not provide us with adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future, we anticipate that we will undertake future debt or equity financings or if necessary, sell certain of our property holdings in 2016 and 2017. 
   
 In the future, we may use a number of different sources to finance our liquidity needs, including cash flows from operations, issuance of debt securities or equity securities (which might be common or preferred stock), private financings (such as additional bank credit facilities, which may or may not be secured by our assets), asset sales, seller financing, property-level mortgage debt, or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. Any debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured.  We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and other costs.  Although we have successfully raised equity capital in the past, we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to be successful in raising capital through issuance of securities.  Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets, our status as a new enterprise without significant assets or demonstrated operating history, and/or the loss of key management.  There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any required additional capital or generate sufficient cash flow from our current and proposed operations to fund our ongoing business.

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.  
   
  Overview  
   
 We are a real estate investment company focused on investing in office, industrial and retail properties located in the  Midwest and South Central regions of the United States .  We target properties located in the area bounded by Minnesota and Texas to the north and south, and by Illinois and Colorado to the east and west, although we will consider properties outside this target area if we identify attractive opportunities. We believe these markets are currently underserved in financing and market transaction options for which we can provide advantageous solutions. We believe the size and location of opportunities in this region will be a desirable fit for our real estate portfolio and can be pursued at attractive yields. 
   
  Our Current Property Interests  
   
 We currently own an interest in four properties located in and around the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota. 
   
 We own a 49% interest in an entity that owns an industrial complex consisting of two buildings with approximately 171,639 square feet located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. We have entered into a contribution agreement to acquire the remaining interest in this entity, subject to receiving consent to the transfer from the entity s lender. 
   
 We also own a 227,000 square foot building situated on 20 acres of land in Minnetonka, Minnesota and a 856,223 square foot thirteen-story office tower located in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.  As of September 30, 2016 the combined occupancy for all of the buildings in our portfolio was 71%.   In April 2015, the Company executed a lease in the St. Paul building for a significant new tenant that would increase the occupancy of our portfolio by over 14% upon occupancy. 
   
 The following table sets forth information regarding our 5 largest tenants as of September 30, 2016. 

(1) 
 The two properties located in Maple Plain, MN lease approximately 15% of the Company s rentable space and account for approximately 6% of the Company s total base rent revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 5% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The property located in Minnetonka, MN leases approximately 17% of the Company s rentable space and accounts for approximately 19% and 18% of the Company s total base rent revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 18% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  No major tenants are located at the property in Minnetonka, MN.  The property located in St. Paul, MN leases approximately 40% of the Company s rentable space and accounts for approximately 76% of the Company s total base rent revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 77% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

23 

The future square feet expiring for all current leases, including leases entered into subsequent to September 30, 2016: 
   
  Years ending December 31,  

(1) 
 On April 1, 2016, the Company received a notice asserting a right to terminate the lease for 141,109 square feet pursuant to certain alleged defaults related to the completion and delivery of the building and tenant improvements under the lease.  The Company is responding to the suit to enforce the lease. 
   
 Management may periodically sell certain properties including core income-producing and value-added properties for various reasons based on individual circumstances and opportunities.  Proceeds from the sale of such properties may be used to repay related property debt, pay transaction expenses, acquire or invest in other properties and for general corporate purposes including satisfying existing liabilities. 
   
  Factors That May Influence Our Operating Results  
   
  Acquisition Strategy . We plan to grow our business through the acquisition of new properties, initially targeting properties that meet the criteria described above under  Overview  and elsewhere in this report. We expect the properties we acquire will be subject to mortgage financing and other indebtedness that we will assume or refinance. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock. 
   
  Rental Revenue . The amount of net rental revenue generated by our properties depends primarily on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease space that becomes available. As of September 30, 2016, our properties were 71% leased. We believe that the average rental rates for our properties are generally equal to the current average quoted market rates.  Negative trends in one or more of these factors such as a decrease in rental rates or a decrease in demand for our properties could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns affecting the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area or downturns in our tenants  businesses that impair our ability to renew leases or re-let space or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments could adversely affect our revenues. In addition, growth in rental revenue primarily will depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria. 
   
  Conditions in Our Markets.  Our current properties are located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions in this area, or areas in our prospective proprieties, including employment and wage rates, natural disasters and other factors, may impact our overall performance.  Our ability to grow in our broader market throughout our region may also be impacted by these factors. 
   
  Operating Expenses . Our operating expenses primarily consist of property taxes, management fees, utilities, insurance and site maintenance costs. As of September 30, 2016, some of our leases required tenants to reimburse us for a share of our operating expenses. Increases or decreases in any unreimbursed operating expenses, either due to the nature of the expenses not requiring reimbursement from our tenants or due to a reduction in leased square footage requiring tenant reimbursement of a portion of our operating expenses, will impact our overall performance. Legal fees incurred in 2016 and 2015 were significant due to the Company s acquisition and refinancing activities, as well as litigation expenses.  We expect an increase in legal fees associated with these activities and business matters customary to a public real estate holding company, as well as our ongoing litigation. 
   
  Interest Expense . Our interest expense will depend on the amounts we borrow as well as the interest rates charged by our lenders. Our current loan agreements are a mix of both fixed and floating rates, as well as secured and unsecured by our properties. Our aggregate interest expense may increase as we acquire properties and could fluctuate between periods based on the variable rate loan arrangements, if we do not hedge any such interest rate risk. 

24 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 Our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of our operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. 
   
 The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company elsewhere in this report. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable as of the date hereof. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.  There have been no significant changes to those policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
   Investment in Real Estate and Fixed Assets   
   
 Investment in real estate and fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property such as land, building and improvements includes cost of acquisitions, development, and construction, and tenant allowances and improvements. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, and major improvements are capitalized. We allocate the cost of an acquisition, including the assumption of liability, to the acquired tangible asset and identifiable intangibles based on their relative fair values. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and  anticipated trends, and market economic conditions.  
   
 We allocate the cost of an acquisition, including the assumption of liability, to the acquired tangible assets (including land, buildings and personal property) determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and identifiable intangibles based on their relative fair values.  Acquisitions of real estate are recorded based upon preliminary allocations of the purchase price to management s assessment of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and any assumed liabilities acquired which are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained up to one year after the date of acquisition.  Adjustments to preliminary allocations of purchase price are adjusted prospectively when all information necessary to determine the relative fair values has been received. 
   
 Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets for building, improvements, and furniture and equipment, and the term of the lease for tenant improvements. The estimated useful lives being used are as follows: 

Intangible Assets   
   
 Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets and any significant intangible assets (such as above- and below-market leases and value of acquired in-place leases), and any assumed liabilities, and allocates the purchase price based on these fair value assessments. The Company amortizes identified intangible assets and liabilities based on the period over which the assets and liabilities are expected to affect the future cash flows of the real estate property acquired. Lease intangibles (such as in-place or above- and below-market leases) are amortized over the term of the related lease. Above and below-market leases are amortized as a reduction in (addition to) rent revenue. Amortization of other intangibles is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. 
   
   Principles of Consolidation   
   
 We evaluate the need to consolidate affiliates based on standards set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810, Consolidation.  In determining whether we have a controlling interest in an affiliate and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors  

25 

such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions, contractual and substantive participating rights of the limited partners and shareholders, as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Talon Real Estate Holding Corp. ( TREHC ) and Talon OP, our Operating Partnership.  Talon OP also consolidates 5130 LLC, an entity in which it has a 49% ownership interest, based on its ability to control the operating and financial decisions of 5130 LLC.  All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
   Noncontrolling Interest   
   
 Interests in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners are represented by Operating Partnership units. The Company's interest in the Operating Partnership was approximately 65% of the common units of the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Operating Partnership s income is allocated to holders of common units based upon the ratio of their holdings to the total units outstanding during the period. Holders of preferred units receive certain distributions based on a percentage of the liquidation preference. Capital contributions, distributions, syndication costs, and profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in accordance with the terms of the Operating Partnership agreement. 
   
 The portion of membership interests in 5130 LLC not held by Talon OP is reported as noncontrolling interest.  Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interest based on membership percentages and terms of the operating agreement. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 Base rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases, inclusive of leases which provide for scheduled rent increases or rent concessions. Differences between rental income earned and amounts due according to the respective lease agreements are credited or charged to deferred rent receivable, as applicable. 
   
 Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Recoveries are billed monthly using estimated operating costs and an additional billing or a refund is made to tenants in the following year after actual operating expenses are determined. 
   
   Accounting Standards Applicable to Emerging Growth Companies   
   
 We qualify as an  emerging growth company  pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with these new or revised accounting standards. Since we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with public company effective dates. If we were to elect to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act. 
   
    Significant Events and Transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2016  
   
 Summarized below are the Company s significant transactions and events during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
  On January 11, 2016, Talon OP, L.P., a Minnesota limited partnership and the entity through which Talon Real Estate Holding Corp. (the     Company    ) conducts substantially all of its business, entered into an asset purchase agreement with LSOP 3 Joint Venture, LLC and LSOP 3C II, LLC.  Under the asset purchase agreement, Talon OP agreed to purchase from LSOP 3 Joint Venture and LSOP 3C II, LLC (a) the membership units in each of LSOP 3 REIT MN, LLC, LSOP 3 REIT MN 2, LLC, and LSOP 3 REIT MN 3, LLC, which own properties located at 6231-6325 Bury Drive, Eden Prairie, MN, 4600 Nathan Lane North, Plymouth, MN and 9600 54th Avenue North, Plymouth, MN, as well as (b) the properties located at 550-590 Hale Avenue North, Oakdale, MN, 7805 Hudson Road, Woodbury, MN, 7400 Flying Cloud Drive and 7660-7716 Golden Triangle Drive, Eden Prairie, MN, 5600-5610 Rowland Road, Minnetonka, MN, 2800 Campus Drive, 2905 Northwest Boulevard and 2955 Xenium Lane North, Plymouth, MN and 7550 Meridian Circle North, Maple Grove, MN for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $81 million.  

26 

The agreement was terminated by the seller on September 7, 2016 as the transaction was not closed by September 1, 2016.  Pursuant to the agreement, Talon OP, along with its partners, previously paid a $750,000 deposit, which the seller has retained. Talon has expensed $300,000 of the total deposit, representing the amount not funded by other parties to the transaction.  
   
  On August 18, 2016, Eun Stowell, the Chief Financial Officer of Talon Real Estate Holding Corp., resigned her positions with the Company. Matthew G. Kaminski served as interim Chief Financial Officer until  November 1, 2016, went Keith Gruebele was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer. 
   
  On September 16, 2016, Neil Brown and Curt Marks resigned from our board of directors.  On September 16, 2016, Marc P. Agar and Kristian G. Wyrobek were elected to our board of directors.  The new directors have been appointed to the audit committee and compensation committees of the board of directors.  
   
  On January 28, 2016, Talon Bren Road, LLC, a subsidiary of Talon OP, L.P., which is the entity through which Talon Real Estate Holding Corp. conducts substantially all of its business, entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Timberland Partners, Inc.  Under the agreement, Talon Bren Road agreed to sell the property located at 10301 Bren Road West, Minnetonka, Minnesota to the buyer     subject to a diligence period and other conditions of the purchase and sale agreement typical of a real estate transaction.  Pursuant to the agreement, in exchange for the property, the buyer paid Talon Bren Road a $100,000 initial deposit and was to pay $25,900,000 at closing, subject to adjustments as set forth in the purchase agreement.    The agreement was terminated by the buyer on November 1, 2016 following the due diligence period.  
   
  Market Conditions and Outlook  
   
 Our last two acquisitions were accomplished utilizing a 721 Exchange tax deferral methodology similar to that of an  UPREIT  providing several unique advantages over a 1031 exchange or selling to cash buyers.   This strategy is advantageous for real estate owners seeking to mitigate and defer their immediate tax obligations, stay invested in real estate, diversify their holdings, and seek potential future growth and liquidity by accepting Talon OP common units which can later be converted 1:1 for Talon common stock under the ticker  TALR  and their capital gains tax obligations are deferred until then. 
   
 Our strategy is to continue offering these tax-deferred solutions to real estate owners as part of diversifying our shareholder base creating liquidity and shareholder value.  We continue to believe office and industrial properties offer the best return on equity metrics as part of our investment strategy.   Retail will also be part of our overall portfolio with an average overall target portfolio contribution of nearly 20% over the long-term. 
   
 The middle corridor of the United States continues to offer higher cap rates compared to the west and east coasts and we will continue to explore additional investment options within this region to continue our mission to provide return on equity targets of 8-15% per asset or portfolio. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 Our revenues and expenses have changed primarily due to increases in expenses is attributable to an increase in legal services related to our legal proceedings in 2016.  We expect our revenues, tenant reimbursements and many expenses will continue to increase on an absolute basis in the future as we seek to acquire additional properties, assume or refinance indebtedness in connection with the acquisitions and build the infrastructure necessary to grow our business.  In the near term, we expect to continue to incur higher legal and other professional fees in pursuit of potential acquisitions. 
   
   Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three months ended September 30, 2015   
   
   Revenues and Expenses   
   
 Rental revenues decreased $87,791, or 4.6%, to $1,807,865 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,895,656 for the same period of the prior year.  The net rental revenues are relatively consistent with the same period in the prior year as the composition of our portfolio stayed the same with a slight decrease in base rents, due to some smaller tenant s leases expiring at the Talon First Trust, LLC s building.   
   
 Tenant reimbursements decreased $10,568, or 1.2%, to $897,805 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $908,373 for the same period of the prior year. This difference is due to the net decrease in tenants paying operating expense reimbursements across the portfolio in 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

27 

General and administrative expenses increased $336,306, or 303.6%, to $447,089 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $110,783 for the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the expensing of a $300,000 deposit on a lost deal and expensing of previously deferred financing costs that were unsuccessful in 2016. 
   
 Salary and compensation expenses increased $110,757 or 62.4%, to $288,191 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $177,434 for the same period of the prior year. The increase in salary and compensation expense in the third quarter of 2016 is attributable to the true up of approximately $107,000 of the cost of the immediate vesting of non-cash stock compensation in the second quarter of 2016. 
   
 Professional fees increased $68,375, or 38.5%, to $245,762 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $177,387 for the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in legal services related to our legal proceedings in the three months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $89,000, offset by a decrease in consulting fees of approximately $24,000 compared to the same period of the prior year. 
   
 Property operating expenses decreased $213,521, or 15.9%, to $1,130,767 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,344,288 for the same period of the prior year. Approximately $83,000 of the decrease in these expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in maintenance, security and janitorial personnel, provision for doubtful accounts decrease of approximately $69,000 and approximately $20,000 of the decrease is due to a decrease in utility costs across the portfolio for the three months in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 
   
 Real estate taxes and insurance increased $42,944 or 10.7%, to $443,111 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $400,167 for the same period of the prior year. The three months ending September 30, 2016 are in line with the annual increase in real estate taxes across the portfolio as the composition of our portfolio stayed the same. 
   
 Depreciation and amortization expense decrease by $41,112, or 3.3%, to $1,220,070 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,261,182 for the same period of the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets expiring in correlation with the applicable leases. 
   
 Interest expense increased by $30,105, or 2.5% to $1,237,722 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,207,617 for the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately $128,000 due to increased financing activity in the three-month period of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.  This was offset somewhat by the reduction of certain financing cost that expired in correlation with the terms of the applicable financing of approximately $225,000, 
   
   Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015

 General and administrative expenses increased $476,674, or 109.7%, to $911,088 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $434,414 for the same period of the prior year.  The increase is primarily due to the expensing of a $300,000 deposit on a lost deal and expensing of previously deferred financing costs that were unsuccessful in 2016. 
   
 Salary and compensation expenses increased $267,233, or 46.1%, to $847,229 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $579,996 for the same period of the prior year. The increase in salary and compensation expense is attributable to the immediate vesting of non-cash stock compensation for awards granted in 2016. 

28 

Professional fees increased $122,992, or 21.4%, to $698,960 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $575,968 for the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in legal services related to our legal proceedings in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year. 
   
 Property operating expenses decreased $549,856, or 14.1%, to $3,353,160 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,903,016 for the same period of the prior year. Approximately $300,000 of the decrease in these expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in maintenance, security and janitorial personnel, provision for doubtful accounts decrease of approximately $69,000 and approximately $68,000 of the decrease is due to a decrease in utility costs across the portfolio for the first nine months in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  An additional $28,000 and $75,000 of the decrease is due to a non-recurring parking lot repair and non-recurring fees, respectively, recognized in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2016. 
   
 Real estate taxes and insurance increased $123,892, or 10.2%, to $1,333,554 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,209,662 for the same period of the prior year.

The decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets expiring in correlation with the applicable leases. 
   
 Interest expense increased by $84,265 or 2.5% to $3,489,012 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,404,747 for the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately $443,000 due to increased financing activity and an approximately $82,000 increase in mortgage interest, offset by the net impact of certain financing costs becoming fully amortized in correlation with the terms of the applicable financing of approximately $442,000 in the nine month period of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
   
  Funds from Operations and Non-GAAP Reconciliation  
   
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines funds from operations, or FFO, as net income (loss) available to common shareholders and operating partnership unit holders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items, plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We intend to calculate FFO in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition. 
   
 Management intends to use FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Because real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself. In addition, securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties use FFO as the primary metric for comparing the relative performance of equity REITs. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures used by REITs. 
   
 FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity. FFO does not reflect working capital changes, cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness. 
   
 We define adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as FFO excluding the non-cash effects of straight-line rent and amortization of lease inducements and deferred financing costs, depreciation of non-real estate, and excluding the effects of non-cash compensation charges. U.S. GAAP requires rental revenues related to non-contingent leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. This method may result in rental income in the early years of a lease that is higher than actual cash received, creating a deferred rent receivable asset or lower income than actual cash received, creating a deferred rent revenue liability included in our consolidated balance sheet. At some point during the lease, depending on its terms, cash rent payments may exceed or be lower than the straight-line rent which results in the deferred rent receivable asset or liability, respectively, decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term. By excluding the non-cash portion of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of lease inducement and deferred financing costs as well as non-cash compensation expense, investors, analysts and our management can compare AFFO between periods. 

29 

Below is the calculation of FFO and AFFO and the reconciliation to net income (loss), which we believe is the most comparable GAAP financial measure: 
   
  Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Talon Real Estate Holding Corp. ( TREHC ) to Funds From Operations  

(1)  Noncontrolling Units of the Operating Partnership are exchangeable for cash, or at the Company's discretion, for common shares of stock on a one-for-one basis. 
  (2)  Net income is calculated on a per share basis.  FFO and AFFO are calculated on a per share and unit basis.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our operations and assets, acquire properties, make distributions to our shareholders and other general business needs. We have incurred significant expenses related to operating as a public corporation, building and tenant improvements at our properties, and preparation for and execution of our acquisition strategy creating a cash shortfall from operations through September 30, 2016. 
   
 We currently do not have available cash and cash flows from current operations to provide us with adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future. Our current liabilities exceed our unrestricted cash and we have insufficient cash flow from current operations to pursue our strategy without further financing.  As of September 30, 2016, we had unrestricted cash of approximately $184,332 and current liabilities including tenant improvement allowances, unsecured debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses substantially in excess of the available cash.  We therefore will require additional capital and increased cash flow from future operations to fund our ongoing business. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any required additional capital or generate sufficient cash flow from our current and future operations to fund our ongoing business. If the amount of capital we are able to raise together with our income from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to cease our operations or alter our growth plans.  If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. 
   
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of the need to raise additional capital to provide funding for approximately $7.8 million of tenant allowances, pay off maturing unsecured notes payable in the approximate amount of $3.7 million, and to use any remaining proceeds to apply to other existing current liabilities.  Additionally, the Company, Talon OP and Mr. Kaminski are also guarantors of a mortgage on the building located at 180 E. Fifth Street in St. Paul, Minnesota.  The mortgage includes a financial covenant requiring the guarantors to maintain a certain net worth and amount of cash and marketable securities throughout the term of the loan.  Failure to satisfy the financial covenant will constitute an event of default under the loan agreements which the lender may remedy by accelerating the debt. We are currently attempting to refinance this mortgage and will attempt to obtain financing with more traditional covenants; however, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to refinance the mortgage with more favorable terms, if at all.  A sale of the building has also been contemplated to address the liquidity issue.  We also require cash to pursue our strategy of near-term growth through acquisition of properties as well as pay our general and administrative expenses for operating as a public company and to satisfy our existing liabilities, as well as to finance our ongoing litigation. 
   
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for scheduled debt maturities, non-recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically and continued expansion of our business through acquisitions. Although we plan to aggressively pursue acquisitions to grow our business, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional properties in the future. 
   
 Since our available cash and cash flows from current operations do not provide us with adequate cash to satisfy current liabilities and are not expected to provide us with adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future, we anticipate that we will undertake future debt or equity financings or asset sales during 2016.  Additional financing or asset sales are necessary for our company to continue as a going concern. 
   
 In the future, we anticipate using a number of different sources to finance our liquidity needs, including cash flows from operations, issuance of debt securities or equity securities (which might be common or preferred stock), private financings (such as additional bank credit facilities or cash advances, which may or may not be secured by our assets), asset sales (including sales of accounts receivable), seller financing, property-level mortgage debt, or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. Any debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured. Although we have successfully raised equity capital in the past, we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to be successful in raising capital through issuance of securities.  Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets, our status as a new enterprise without significant assets or demonstrated operating history, and/or the loss of key management.  There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any required additional capital or generate sufficient cash flow from our current and proposed operations to fund our ongoing business.  Ongoing litigation may also impact our liquidity, as cash flow may need to be used on legal and other litigation expenses.

Outstanding Indebtedness  
   
 5130 LLC, an entity in which our Operating Partnership owns a 49% interest and that owns an industrial complex located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, is party to a loan agreement secured by such industrial complex. The loan agreement provides for two term loans, the A loan and the B loan. Both loans can be accelerated under certain circumstances, including if there is an event of default under the loan agreement. 
   
 Talon Bren Road, LLC, an entity through which our Operating Partnership acquired the property located at 10301 Bren Road West, Minnetonka, MN on May 29, 2014, is party to a loan agreement secured by such property.  It is also a party to two loans the proceeds of which were used to fund certain capital improvements at the building.  This property also secures the Talon Bren Road, LLC Mortgage 2 (as defined in the table below) entered into on July 2, 2014 in connection with the acquisition of the property located at 180 E. Fifth Street St. Paul, MN. 
   
 Talon First Trust, LLC, an entity through which our Operating Partnership acquired the property located at 180 E. Fifth Street St. Paul, MN on July 2, 2014, is party to a loan agreement secured by such property.  The loan is subject to certain financial covenants as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  On March 30, 2016, the lender accepted Mr. Kaminski as an additional guarantor under the loan agreements.  Although Mr. Kaminski, the Company and Talon OP have executed a joinder agreement adding Mr. Kaminski as an additional guarantor on the loan, the lender has reserved all rights, remedies and recourses available to it for any event of default whether arising prior or after the date of the agreement.  There is no assurance that the financial covenants will be satisfied in the future. 
   
 The following table summarizes the Company s notes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1) 
 Beginning January 2016, mechanics lien statements were filed upon the property at 180 E. Fifth Street for work completed to prepare the tenant space for a significant lease entered into on April 9, 2015.  Mechanics liens that remain undischarged of record after 60 days constitute an event of default under the loan agreements, permitting the lender to accelerate the indebtedness at its option.  On September 21, 2016 and October 20, 2016, mechanics lien holders filed a summons and complaint in the State of Minnesota claiming that the Company breached it s obligations to which the Company has responded. At this time, the Company is unable to determine the outcome of, and therefore has not recorded any obligations with respect to this dispute.    The lender is aware of this default and our refinancing efforts to cure it.  They are currently not exercising any remedies with respect to any defaults. 
 (2) 
 On November 16, 2015 the Company entered into a $481,934 unsecured promissory note with the Property Manager of Talon First Trust, LLC. The note satisfied the fees due under the Property Management Agreement for the period of March 2015 through December 2015 and had an original maturity date of December 31, 2015.  Subsequently, the Company extended the maturity date to February 15, 2016 and then to August 31, 2016 and increased the note by $471,974 for the fees incurred from January 2016 through July 2016 and interest incurred through May 31, 2016 per the terms of the promissory notes and Property Management Agreement entered into with the Property Manager (see Note 9 to the financial statements).  The note bore interest at 8% annually from November 16, 2015 through June 30, 2016 and currently bears interest at 10% annually through maturity. On September 21, 2016, and subsequently as amended on September 22, 2016, the Property Manager filed a summons and complaint in the State of Minnesota claiming that the Company breached its obligation under the notes to which the Company has responded.  At this time, the Company is unable to determine the outcome of, and therefore has not recorded any obligations with respect to this dispute. 
 (3) 
 The outstanding principal and applicable accrued interest is due in full upon sale or refinancing of the property at 180 E. Fifth Street in St. Paul. 
 (4) 
 On June 29, 2016 the Company received funds from two different sources totaling $235,993 for the sale of future receivables at the property located at 180 E. Fifth Street.  The agreements require payments totaling $352,305 over 120 days.  Per FASB ASC 470-10-25, which provides guidance on funds received from sales of future receivables, this transaction has been classified as debt and included in notes payable. The agreements are guaranteed by a shareholder of the Company. 

32 

(5) 
 On January 12, 2015 and May 19, 2015, respectively, the Company entered into two separate $500,000 unsecured promissory notes with the same unrelated party. The notes bore interest at 14% annually and had an original maturity date of June 30, 2015 and July 18, 2015, respectively.  In 2015, the Company extended the maturity dates of both notes to December 31, 2015.  The notes bore interest of 20% annually from July 1, 2015 and July 19, 2015, respectively, through October 31, 2015.  Subsequently, the Company extended the maturity dates of both notes to the earlier of, the disposition or refinancing of the property at 180 E 5th Street in St. Paul or June 30, 2016.  The notes will bear interest at 24% annually from November 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. The maturity date has not been extended and the note is due and payable in full.  On September 24, 2016, the unrelated party filed a summons and complaint in the State of Minnesota claiming that the Company breached its obligation under the notes to which the Company has responded.  At this time, the Company is unable to determine the outcome of, and therefore has not recorded any obligations with respect to this dispute. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 At September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Inflation  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, most of our leases required tenants to reimburse us for a share of our operating expenses. As result, we are able to pass on much of any increases to our property operating expenses that might occur due to inflation by correspondingly increasing our expense reimbursement revenues. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, inflation did not have a material impact on our revenues or net income.   
   
  Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
   
  Interest Rate Sensitivity Risk  
   
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that interest rate risk will be the primary market risk to which we will be exposed. As of September 30, 2016, all but one of our outstanding loans had a fixed rate.  On July 2, 2014, we secured a $33 million loan with a current interest rate of 5.75% which is indexed monthly to the one month LIBOR plus a spread of 5.50% per annum.  In conjunction with the closing of this loan, we are party to an interest rate cap transaction with an interest rate cap of 2.50% on the $33 million. We were at risk to interest rate fluctuations on $33 million up to the interest rate cap of 2.50% until expiration of the cap on July 5, 2016, after which time our interest rate risk is no longer capped.  Our interest rate risk may further increase if we increase our debt in the future or refinance our existing debt. 
   
 We may become exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of floating rate debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to manage overall borrowing. 
   
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  
   
 Our results of operations and cash flows are not materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
   
    Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

33 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
   
 There were the following changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 which have the potential to have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  On August 18, 2016, Eun Stowell, the Chief Financial Officer of Talon Real Estate Holding Corp., resigned her positions with the Company. Matthew G. Kaminski served as interim Chief Financial Officer until  November 1, 2016, when Keith Gruebele was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer. 
   
  On September 16, 2016, Neil Brown and Curt Marks resigned from our board of directors.  On September 16, 2016, Marc P. Agar and Kristian G. Wyrobek were elected to our board of directors.  The new directors have been appointed to the audit committee and compensation committees of the board of directors.

PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION  
   
    Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings  
   
 We are currently engaged in legal proceedings that may have a material impact on our financial statements.  From time to time, we may be named as a defendant in legal actions or otherwise be subject to claims arising from our normal business activities.  Any such actions, even those that lack merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
