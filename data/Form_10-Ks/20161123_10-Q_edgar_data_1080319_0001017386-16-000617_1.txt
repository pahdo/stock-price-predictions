1. Basis of Presentation and Nature of Business 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information
and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which
include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the
results of operations and cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other information
disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent periods
or for the entire year ending December 31, 2016. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial
statements at that date. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations. These unaudited consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December
31, 2015 as included in our Annual Report on form 10-K. 

Nature of Business 

Newgioco Group, Inc. ( Newgioco Group 
or the  Company ), formerly known as Empire Global Corp., was incorporated in the state of Delaware on August 26, 1998
as Pender International Inc. On July 20, 2016, the Company changed its name to Newgioco Group, Inc. The Company maintains its principal
executive offices in Toronto, Canada. 

The Company provides web-based and land-based
gaming services through its four wholly owned subsidiaries in Italy. The Company s subsidiaries include: Multigioco Srl ( Multigioco )
which was acquired on August 15, 2014, Rifa Srl ( Rifa ) which was acquired on January 1, 2015, as well as Ulisse Gmbh
( Ulisse ) and Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung Gmbh ( Odissea ) which were both acquired on July 1,
2016. 

Newgioco Group, is now a vertically integrated
company offering a complete suite of gaming services including a variety of online and offline lottery and casino gaming, as well
as sports betting through a retail distribution of leisure betting locations situated throughout Italy, in addition to operating
a proprietary Betting Operating System ( BOS ). 

2. Going concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company had a working capital deficit of
$601,847 as of September 30, 2016, and reported operating losses for the past two years. There are no assurances that management
will be successful in achieving sufficient cash flows to fund the Company's working capital needs, or whether the Company will
be able to refinance or renegotiate its obligations when they become due or raise additional capital through future debt or equity.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments
have been made to the carrying value of assets or liabilities as a result of this uncertainty. 

Management plans to mitigate its losses in
future years by significantly reducing its operating expenses, seeking out new business opportunities and attempting to raise debt
or equity financing. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing, reduce its operating
expenses or be successful in maintaining a viable business.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

a) Basis of consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All significant inter-company transactions
are eliminated upon consolidation. 

Certain amounts of prior periods were reclassified
to conform with current period presentation. 

b) Use of estimates 

The preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions include valuing equity securities issued in share based payment arrangements,
determining the fair value of assets acquired, allocation of purchase price, impairment of long-lived assets, the collectability
of receivables and the value of deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Certain estimates, including evaluating the collectability
of receivables and advances, could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to our industry, and general economic
conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates that could cause actual results to
differ from our estimates. We re-evaluate all of our accounting estimates at least quarterly based on these conditions and record
adjustments when necessary. 

c) Goodwill 

Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not being
amortized, but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative
assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing
the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units
is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on
revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Fair value determinations may include
both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the
fourth quarter. 

We perform the allocation based on our knowledge
of the market in which we operate, and our overall knowledge of the gaming industry. 

d) Business Combinations 

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration
to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the
fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 

Such valuations require management to make
significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible
assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from
a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from
estimates. 

e) Long-Lived Assets 

We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived
assets for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets to the net book value of the assets
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. If the expected undiscounted
future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value
will be charged to earnings. 

Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows
of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, appraisals, and, if appropriate,
current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. 

8 

f) Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company does not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including
convertible notes and stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as
charges or credits to income. 

For option-based simple derivative financial
instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent
valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

g) Earnings Per Share 

FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share 
provides for calculation of  basic  and  diluted  earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no
dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an
entity similar to fully diluted earnings per share. These potentially dilutive securities were not included in the calculation
of loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, thus the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share is the same for all periods presented. 

h) Currency translation 

Since the Company's subsidiaries operates in
Italy, the subsidiaries functional currency is the Euro. In the consolidated financial statements, revenue and expense accounts
are translated at the average rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at period-end rates and equity
accounts are translated at historical rate. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period
to period are included as a component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized
in current operations. 

i) Revenue Recognition 

Revenues from sports-betting, casino, cash
and skill games; slots, bingo and horse race wagers represent the gross pay-ins (also referred to as Turnover) from customers less
gaming taxes and payouts to customers. Revenues are recorded when the game is closed. In addition, the Company receives commissions
from the sale of scratch tickets and other lottery games. Commissions are recorded when the ticket for scratch off tickets and
lottery tickets are sold. 

Revenues from Betting Operating System ( BOS )
include license fees, training, installation, and product support services. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and
rewards of ownership are transferred or when the obligation is fulfilled. License fees are calculated as a percentage of each licensee s
level of activity and are contingent upon the licensee s usage. The license fees were recognized on an accrual basis as earned. 

j) Gaming accounts receivable   allowance
for doubtful accounts 

Gaming accounts receivable represents gaming deposits made by customers to their online gaming accounts either
directly by credit card, bank wire, e-wallet or other accepted method through one of our websites or indirectly in cash at the
cashier of a betting shop but not yet credited to our bank accounts and subject to normal trade collection terms without discounts.
The Company periodically evaluates the collectability of its gaming accounts receivable and considers the need to record or adjust
an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collection experience and specific customer information. Actual amounts
could vary from the recorded estimates. The Company does not require collateral to support customer receivables.  

9 

k) Gaming account balances 

Gaming account balances represent customer
balances, including winnings and deposits, that are held as credits in online gaming accounts and have not as of yet been used
or withdrawn by the customers. Customers can request payment from the Company at any time and the payment to customers can be made
through bank wire, credit card, or cash disbursement from one of our locations. Online gaming account credit balances are non-interest
bearing. 

l) Fair Value Measurements 

ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which
little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that
a market participant would use. 

The carrying value of the Company's short term
investments, prepaid expenses, accounts receivables, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, gaming account
balance, and advances from shareholder approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

The derivative liability in connection with
the conversion feature of the convertible debt and warrants is classified as a level 3 liability, and is the only financial liability
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

The change in the Level 3 financial instrument
is as follows: 

m) Income Taxes 

We use the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense is recognized
for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences
resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred
tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. 

The Company has elected to include interest
and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if determined, as a component of income tax expense. 

10 

In Italy, tax years beginning 2010 forward
are open and subject to examination. The Company is not currently under examination and it has not been notified of a pending examination. 

n) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance
provides that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from
the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company adopted this guidance with the annual and
the interim period beginning January 1, 2016, and applied the standard on a retrospective basis as of December 31, 2015. The adoption
of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position and did not impact our results of operations or cash
flows. 

There are no other recently issued accounting
standards that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

4. Acquisition of Ulisse Gmbh and Odissea Betriebsinformatik
Beratung Gmbh 

Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung Gmbh
( Odissea ) Acquisition 

On June 30, 2016, the Company entered into
a Share Exchange Agreement, which closed on July 1, 2016, with the shareholders of Odissea organized under the laws of Austria.
Odissea operates a proprietary Betting Operating System. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued 4,386,100 shares of common
stock in consideration for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Odissea. As a result of this acquisition, the sellers now
hold approximately 12.56% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 

The purchase price was allocated to the fair
market value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Intangible assets will be amortized over their
remaining useful life as follows: 

Ulisse Gmbh ( Ulisse )
Acquisition 

On June 30, 2016, the Company entered into
a Share Exchange Agreement, which closed on July 1, 2016, with the shareholders of Ulisse organized under the laws of Austria.
Ulisse operates an existing network of 107 land-based Agency locations. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued 1,665,600
shares of common stock in consideration for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ulisse. As a result of this acquisition,
the sellers now hold approximately 4.77% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 

The purchase price was allocated to the fair
market value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Intangible assets will be amortized over their
remaining useful life as follows: 

11 

The Company has estimated the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions and is currently undergoing a formal valuation and will
adjust these estimates accordingly within the one year measurement period. 

The unaudited pro forma combined historical
results, as if Odissea and Ulisse had been acquired at the beginning of 2016 are as follows: 

5. Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consist of the following: 

The Company evaluates intangible assets for
impairment on an annual basis during the last month of each year and at an interim date if indications of impairment exist. Intangible
asset impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount with an impairment being recognized
only when the fair value is less than carrying value. The amortization expense was $113,183 and $352,350 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, and $104,271 and $287,640 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

12 

6. Line of Credit   Bank 

The Company currently maintains an operating
line of credit for a maximum amount of EUR 300,000 (approximately U.S. $336,600) for Multigioco and EUR 50,000 (approximately U.S.
$56,100) for Rifa from Banca Veneto in Italy. The line of credit is secured by restricted cash on deposit at Banca Veneto and guaranteed
by certain shareholders of the Company and bears a fixed rate of interest at 5% per annum on the outstanding balance with no minimum payment, maturity or due date. 

7. Liability in connection with acquisition 

Liability in connection with acquisition represent
non-interest bearing amount due by the Company s subsidiaries toward the purchase price per purchase agreement between Newgioco
Srl and the Company s subsidiaries. The Company s shareholder and director, Beniamino Gianfelici, owns 50% shares of
Newgioco Srl. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company paid EUR 181,000 (approximately U.S. $202,000) to Newgioco
Srl. 

8. Related party transactions and balances 

Advances from stockholders represent non-interest
bearing loans that are due on demand. Interest was imputed at 5% per annum. Balances of Advances from stockholders are as follows: 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, Gold Street Capital Corp. ( Gold Street ), the major stockholder of the Company, advanced $139,887 net of repayment
of $53,000. On March 31, 2016, the Company issued 145,500 shares to Gold Street to pay $138,228 of the debt at the market price
of $0.95 per share. 

Also, Doriana Gianfelici advanced approximately
U.S. $1,533 to the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Advances from other stockholders include balances
of approximately U.S. $1,545 due to former stockholders of Ulisse and Odissea. Following the acquisition on July 1, 2016, in the
three months ended September 30, 2016, Luca Pasquini advanced approximately U.S. $1,720 to the Company. 

Related-Party Debt

obtained a loan of EUR 500,000 (approximately U.S. $561,000) from Banca Veneto in Italy, which is secured by the Company's
assets. The loan is amortized over 57 months ending September 30, 2021 with repayment starting on January 31, 2017 in monthly
installments of EUR 9,760 (approximately U.S. $10,950) with an underlying interest rate of 4.5 points above Euro Inter Bank

Agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 130,435 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.15 per share which
may be exercised by the warrant holder between August 28, 2016 and February 28, 2019 (see Note 10). The fair value of the warrants
of $106,583 was calculated using the Black-Scholes model on the date of issuance and was recorded as a debt discount, which has
been amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. 

The following assumptions were used to calculate
the fair value of warrants at February 29, 2016: 

On March 31, 2016, the Company issued a warrant
to purchase 32,609 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.15 per share which may be exercised by the warrant holder until
March 31, 2019 (see Note 10). The warrant was issued in connection with the March 31, 2016 Convertible Promissory Note. The
fair value of the warrants of $27,901 was calculated using the Black-Scholes model on the date of issuance and was recorded as
a debt discount, which has been amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. 

The following assumptions were used to calculate
the fair value of warrants at March 31, 2016: 

On April 1, 2016, the Company issued a warrant
to purchase 62,220 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.15 per share which may be exercised by the warrant holder until
April 1, 2019 (see Note 10). The warrant was issued to the placement agent in relation to securing the February 29, 2016 and
March 31, 2016 convertible Promissory Notes. The fair value of the warrants of $53,236 was calculated using the Black-Scholes model
on the date of issuance, and was recorded as a deferred loan cost, which has been amortized over the life of the debt. 

The following assumptions were used to calculate
the fair value of warrants at April 1, 2016:

A summary of warrant transactions during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

14. Derivative Liability and Fair Value 

The Company has evaluated the application of
ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging and ASC 815-40-25 to the warrants to purchase common stock issued with the convertible notes and
debentures. Based on the guidance in ASC 815 and ASC 815-40-25, the Company concluded these instruments were required to be accounted
for as derivatives due to the down round protection feature on the conversion price and the exercise price. The Company records
the fair value of these derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the values of these derivatives reflected
in the statements of operations as  Gain (loss) on derivative liabilities.  These derivative instruments are not designated
as hedging instruments under ASC 815 and are disclosed on the balance sheet under Derivative Liabilities. 

The Company accounted for the issuance of the
convertible note on February 29, 2016 and March 31, 2016 in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging.  The
note is convertible into an indeterminate number of shares for which the Company cannot determine if it has sufficient authorized
shares to settle the transaction with. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is a derivative liability and is marked to market
through earnings at the end of each reporting period. 

The gross proceeds from the sale of the debentures
are recorded net of $556,020 related to the conversion feature of the embedded conversion option and $114,031 allocated to
the warrants issued. 

The following assumptions were used to calculate
the fair value of derivative liabilities at September 30, 2016:

15. Revenues 

The following table sets forth the breakdown
of net gaming revenues : 

Turnover represents the total bets processed
for the period. 

16. Income Taxes 

The Company is incorporated in the United States
of America and is subject to United States federal taxation. No provisions for income taxes have been made as the Company had no
U.S. taxable income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company's Italian subsidiaries are governed
by the income tax laws of Italy. The corporate tax rate in Italy is 32.32% (IRES at 27.5% plus IRAP ordinary at 4.85%) on income
reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments. 

The reconciliation of income tax expense at
the U.S. statutory rate of 35% to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows: 

18 

The Company has accumulated a net operating
loss carry forward ( NOL ) of approximately $10.4 million as of September 30, 2016, in the U.S. This NOL may be
offset against future taxable income through the year 2035. The use of these losses to reduce future income taxes will depend on
the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL. The Company periodically evaluates whether it is
more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred income tax asset. At the present time,
management cannot presently determine when the Company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred
tax asset; accordingly, a 100% valuation allowance has been established to offset the asset. 

Utilization of NOLs are subject to limitation
due to any ownership change (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) which resulted in a change in business
direction. Unused limitations may be carried over to future years until the NOLs expire. Utilization of NOLs may also be limited
in any one year by alternative minimum tax rules. 

Under Italian tax law, the operating loss carryforwards
available for offset against future profits can be used indefinitely. Operating loss carryforwards are only available for offset
against national income tax, in the limit of 80% of taxable annual income (this restriction does not apply to the operating loss
incurred in the first three years of the Company's activity, which are therefore available for 100% offsetting). 

The provisions for income taxes consist of
currently payable Italian income tax. The provisions for income taxes are summarized as follows: 

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s
net deferred tax asset are as follows: 

17. Subsequent Events 

On October 5, 2016, Darling Capital, LLC gave
the Company notice of their intent to call the Convertible Note obligations dated February 29, 2016 and March 31, 2016 (the  convertible
notes ). The convertible notes were guaranteed by Confidi Union Impresa ( Confidi ), an unrelated party. As a result,
the Company is currently seeking an adjudication of the guarantee with Confidi for payment of the note obligations. If the claim
is approved, the Company will tender reimbursement of the amounts paid pursuant to the note obligations to Confidi. If the claim
is not approved, the Company will be obligated to settle the amounts due to Darling from available cash.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

Except as expressly stated, the financial condition
and results of operations discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
( MD A ) are those of Newgioco Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The MD A is intended to provide the reader
of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD A is provided as a supplement
to, and should be read in conjunction with, our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes on this Form
10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us
to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present, in all material respects, our analysis of trends
and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole. 

General Plan of Operation 

Newgioco Group, Inc. ( Newgioco Group 
or the  Company ), formerly known as Empire Global Corp., was incorporated in the state of Delaware on August 26, 1998
as Pender International Inc. On July 20, 2016, the Company has changed its name to Newgioco Group Inc. The Company maintains its
principal executive offices in Toronto, Canada. 

On August 15, 2014, we completed the acquisition
of 100% ownership in Multigioco, a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy, and is now a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. As a result of the acquisition of Multigioco, our principal business became a licensed online gaming operator offering
web-based gambling and sports betting. 

On January 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition
of Rifa, and Multigioco purchased offline gaming assets, from Newgioco Srl, which included a Bersani license along with 3
corner rights to operate under Multigioco and Rifa purchased 1 agency right from Newgioco Srl to operate under Rifa's Monti
license. Pursuant to the agreement, Rifa assumed the lease on the premises and also acquired the equipment assets within the agency.
On June 1, 2015, the Company opened its second agency location in Rome under Rifa. 

On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired Odissea,
a company operating a proprietary Betting Operating System ( BOS ) with a fully staffed software development team. 

On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired Ulisse,
a company operating a network of 107 land-based agency locations throughout Italy. 

As of the date of this report, our subsidiaries
owned and operated 900 web-based shops, 7 corners, and 109 agencies. 

Newgioco Group is now a vertically integrated
company offering a complete suite of gaming services including a variety of online and offline lottery and casino gaming, as well
as sports betting through a retail distribution of leisure betting locations situated throughout Italy, in addition to operating
its proprietary BOS. 

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS AND NINE MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015. 

Overall Results of Operations 

As a result of the acquisitions of Multigioco,
Rifa, Odissea, and Ulisse, our business operations have changed. Accordingly, comparisons of our results of operations and cash
flows periods prior to these acquisitions are generally not meaningful. 

The Company has incurred substantial costs
related to the acquisition of our new businesses and is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture,
including limited capital resources, possible delays in the decision and implementation of a new business plan. Our primary focus
is on increasing revenues by capturing a larger market share by acquiring new clients and gaming locations. 

20 

Revenues 

The Company generated revenues of $2,606,670
and $5,879,514 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,120,402 and $3,327,610 in revenues
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The revenues are comprised of Net Gaming Revenues derived
from providing online and offline gaming products, services, and BOS services in Italy. 

The increase in revenues in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period ended September 30, 2015 is attributed to the growth in our land-based gaming
operations. The Company had approximately 900 web-based shops, 7 corners and 109 agencies as of September 30, 2016, compared to
approximately 900 web-based shops, 7 corners and 2 agencies as at September 30, 2015. 

The Company has reduced its web-based shop
footprint from 1,067 locations on June 30, 2016, to approximately 900 locations on September 30, 2016. The discontinued locations
were not meeting performance goals and management expects no adverse effect on our future web-based operations and revenue stream. 

The following table represents a detailed breakdown
of revenue from our gaming operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015: 

Turnover represents the total bets processed
for the period. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

The Company incurred general and administrative
expenses of $973,025 and $2,620,973 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to general and
administrative expenses of $696,359 and $1,806,830 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase
was a result of an increase in our distribution of land-based gaming operations. 

The Company's major general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were salaries of $644,842, cash and non-cash professional fees of $536,677,
depreciation and amortization expenses of $375,207, and management fees of $90,000, compared to salaries of $299,553, cash and
non-cash professional fees of $530,928, depreciation and amortization expense of $311,605, and management fees of $90,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Direct Selling Costs 

Direct selling costs represent the fees we
pay to our network service provider, ADM license fees, and commissions for field agents and promoters which is essentially considered
an ongoing marketing cost. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 our selling expenses were $1,087,112 and $3,401,572,
respectively, compared to $787,163 and $2,453,392 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase
was due to the expansion of operations from 900 web-based, 5 corner, and 2 agency locations during the period ended September 30,
2015 to 900 web-based, 7 corner, and 109 agency locations during the period ended September 30, 2016.

Interest Expenses, net of interest income 

The Company had incurred interest expenses,
net of interest income, of $209,556 and $515,051 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to $49,782 and $82,255 in interest expense, net of interest income, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The increase in interest expense incurred is
related to non-cash interest of $168,890 and $400,668 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
relating to the issuance of convertible debentures and interest accrued on debentures and promissory notes. Please see Notes 11,
12 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements. 

The Company had recorded an imputed interest
expense of $3,492 and $6,060 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to an imputed interest
expense of $1,752 and $3,698 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Advances from stockholders are
non-interest bearing and are due on demand. Interest was imputed at 5% per annum. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

Changes in fair value of derivative liabilities
generated a loss of $77,095 and a gain of $291,121 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to a loss of $15,614 and a loss of $15,694 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The fluctuation
is attributed to the increase of the Company s share price from $0.30 on June 30, 2016 to $0.40 on September 30, 2016. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded provision for income taxes
of $220,275 and $248,138 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the provision for income
taxes of $36,857 and $63,402 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due to the increased taxable
income in Italy and the acquisition of Odissea and Ulisse. 

Net Loss 

The Company had a net income of $36,115, or
$0.00 per share (basic and diluted) and a net loss of $621,159, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to a net loss of $467,125, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) and $1,192,613,
or $0.05 per share (basic and diluted) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively. The increase in net
income is attributed to the revenue stream from the July 1, 2016 acquisitions. See Note 4. 

Other Comprehensive Income 

Our other comprehensive income consists of
foreign currency translation adjustments related to the effect of foreign exchange on our operations. 

The Company's reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar while the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the Euro, the local currency in Italy. The financial statements of
our subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, using year-end rates of exchange for assets
and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs, and expenses and historical rates for equity.
Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are
included in determining other comprehensive income. 

The Company experienced a foreign currency
translation adjustment gain of $4,814 and a loss of $5,463 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to a foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $124,409 and income of $62,985 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

The net cash used in operating activities was
$78,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $227,249 in net cash used by operating activities in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The change was attributed primarily to an increase of amortization of deferred costs, an increase of non-cash interest, a decrease of change in fair
value of derivative liabilities, a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in other
current assets. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

The net cash provided by investing activities
was $447,270 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $207,931 in net cash used in investing activities for the
nine ended September 30. 2015. The change was due primarily to cash acquired on acquisition. 

22 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
$1,121,872 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $174,223 in net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was due to the issuance of a convertible note, promissory note, and a
bank loan from Banca Veneto, net of repayment of a bank credit line. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Assets 

At September 30, 2016, we had a total of $7,147,865
in assets compared to $3,646,951 in assets at December 31, 2015. 

Liabilities 

At September 30, 2016, we had $3,196,243 in
current liabilities and $579,610 in long term liabilities, compared to current liabilities of $2,275,085 and long term liabilities
of $67,532 at December 31, 2015. 

Working Capital 

The Company had $1,678,671 in cash and cash
equivalents at September 30, 2016, compared to $157,363 cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016,
we had a total accumulated deficit of $9,916,004. 

We had $3,196,243 in current liabilities and
$2,594,396 in current assets, as such we are left with a working capital deficit of $601,847 as of September 30, 2016. 

There is no assurance that we will be able
to achieve a profitable level of operations sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs. 

During the past several years we sustained
recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. We currently have a working capital deficit. Our operations most recently
have been funded through a combination of the sale of debentures, convertible and promissory notes, as well as through the issuance
of our common stock. We are pursuing potential equity and/or debt investors and have engaged placement agents to assist us in this
initiative. While we are pursuing the opportunities and actions described above, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in our efforts. 

The Company currently maintains an operating
line of credit for a maximum amount of EUR 350,000 (approximately U.S. $392,700) from Banca Veneto in Italy. The line of credit
is guaranteed by certain shareholders of the Company and bears a fixed rate of interest at 5% per annum on the outstanding balance
with no minimum payment, maturity or due date. 

On September 30, 2016, the Company obtained a loan of EUR 500,000 (approximately U.S. $561,000) from Banca
Veneto in Italy, which is secured by the Company's assets. The loan is amortized over 57 months ending September 30, 2021 with
repayment starting on January 31, 2017 in monthly installments of EUR 9,760 (approximately U.S. $10,950) with an underlying interest
of 4.5 points above Euro Inter Bank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR ), subject to quarterly review. 

Although we intend to maintain our lending
relationships with Banca Veneto, we believe that our focus should be on obtaining additional capital through the private placement
and/or the sale of our securities. Any additional equity financing may result in substantial dilution to the percentage ownership
of our stockholders. 

Contractual Obligations 

Current accounting standards require disclosure
of material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt, lease agreements, and purchase obligations.
Please refer to Notes 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to
debt obligations. 

23 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that we expect to be material to investors.
We do not have any non-consolidated, special-purpose entities. 

Related-Party Transactions 

Advances from stockholders represent non-interest
bearing loans that are due on demand. Interest was imputed at 5% per annum. Balances of Advances from stockholders are as follows:

of $0.95 per share. 

Also, Doriana Gianfelici advanced approximately
U.S. $1,533 to the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Advances from other stockholders include balances
of approximately U.S. $1,545 due to former stockholders of Ulisse and Odissea. Following the acquisition on July 1, 2016, in the
three months ended September 30, 2016, Luca Pasquini advanced approximately U.S. $1,720 to the Company. 

Related-Party Debts 

On January 13, 2016, the Company issued a Promissory
Note for $90,750 to Braydon Capital Corp., a company owned by Claudio Ciavarella, the brother of our CEO, that bears interest at
a rate of 1% per month due in full on the maturity date of January 13, 2017. On April 29, 2016, the Note was amended to add $41,095
in funds issued to the Company from Braydon Capital Corp. for a total of $131,845. The balance due to Braydon Capital Corp. was
$318,078 and $186,233 as September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

the Company inherited a loan from Alessandro Pasquini, cousin of our director Luca Pascquini. As of September 30, 2016, the balance
of the loan was EUR 36,000 (approximately U.S. $40,392) to be repaid in EUR 5,000 (approximately U.S. $5,610) monthly installments.
See Note 4. 

The Company currently maintains an operating
line of credit for its subsidiaries secured by restricted cash on deposit at Banca Veneto and guaranteed by certain shareholders
of the Company. See also Note 5 Line of Credit - Bank. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the company paid EUR 181,000 (approximately U.S. $202,000) to Newgioco Srl. The Company s shareholder and director,
Beniamino Gianfelici, owns 50% shares of Newgioco Srl. 

The Company agreed to pay management
fee to Gold Street Capital Corp for $120,000 per year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company accrued
management fee of $30,000 each quarter. 

24 

Inflation 

We do not believe that general price inflation
will have a material effect on the Company's business in the near future. 

Foreign Exchange 

Transactions involving the Company are generally
denominated in U.S. dollars while the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the Euro. Changes and fluctuations in the foreign
exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar will have an effect on our results of operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

Newgioco Group is a smaller reporting company
(as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) and is not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the  Exchange Act )), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SEC's rules and forms
and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive
Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), who are the same person, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15d-14 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on the foregoing evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that due to our limited resources our disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective in providing material information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings on a timely basis and to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure about our internal control over financial reporting
discussed below. 

25 

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Our internal control system was designed to,
in general, provide reasonable assurance to our management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. The framework used by management in making that assessment
was the criteria set forth in the document entitled  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as
of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to material weaknesses resulting from
our limited resources. 

Management's report was not subject to attestation
by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes to our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered
by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

26 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

The Company may be subject to claims arising
in the ordinary course of business. We are not a party to, or the subject of, any pending legal proceeding. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Newgioco Group is a smaller reporting company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item.

and Use of Proceeds.
