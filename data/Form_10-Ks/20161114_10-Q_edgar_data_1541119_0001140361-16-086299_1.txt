These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included.  Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016 ( 2015 Form 10-K ).  The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the 2015 Form 10-K.  Certain amounts in the prior quarters  consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  These classifications do not have an impact on previously reported consolidated net income, retained earnings, stockholders  equity or earnings per share.

Note 2   Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued or Adopted

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates Topic 606 and supersedes Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which postponed the effective date of 2014-09. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net, which amended the principal versus agent implementation guidance set for in ASU 2014-09. Among other things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The ASU amends certain aspects of the guidance set forth in the FASB's new revenue standard related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In general, the new ASU requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients, but does not change the core revenue recognition principle in Topic 606. This ASU  is effective for for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is not permitted. For financial reporting purposes, the ASU allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning this ASU is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the ASU  is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU is recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. This ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. In addition, the ASU requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This ASU also eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The ASU also requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit ) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, the assets and liabilities arising from operating leases. A lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. A lessee should include payments to be made in an optional period only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. For a finance lease, interest payments should be recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income. For operating leases, the lease cost should be allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the amendments in the ASU is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships. A contract novation refers to replacing one of the parties to a derivative instrument with a new party. This ASU clarifies that a change in counterparty in a derivative instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship and therefore discontinue the application of hedge accounting. ASU 2016-05 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The adoption of ASU 2016-05 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The ASU eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an adjustment must be made to the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of ASU is being reviewed for any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology that recognizes credit losses when a probable loss has been incurred with new methodology where loss estimates are based upon lifetime expected credit losses. The amendments in this ASU require a financial asset that is measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The income statement would then reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as changes to the expected credit losses that have taken place during the reporting period. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that impact the collectability of the reported amount. Available-for-sale securities will bifurcate the fair value mark and establish an allowance for credit losses through the income statement for the credit portion of that mark. The interest portion will continue to be recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The change in allowance recognized as a result of adoption will occur through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the ASU is adopted. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This ASU addresses the appropriate classification of eight specific cash flow issues on the cash flow statement. Debt prepayment costs should be classified as an outflow for financing activities. Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments divides the interest portion as an outflow for operating activities and the principal portion as an outflow for financing activities. Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination should be classified as outflows for financing and operating activities. Proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies should be classified as inflows from investing activities. Other specific areas are identified in the ASU as to the appropriate classification of the cash inflows or outflows.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Credit Quality Indicators.   Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans as substandard, doubtful or loss.  An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged.  Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses of currently existing facts, conditions and values.  Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.

When we classify problem loans as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent to address the risk specifically (if the loan is impaired) or we may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance (if the loan is not impaired).  General allowances represent loss reserves which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem loans.  When the Company classifies problem loans as a loss, we charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible.  Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard, doubtful or loss but possess identified weaknesses are classified as either watch or special mention assets.  Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), the Bank s federal regulatory, and the Washington Department of Financial Institutions, the Bank s state banking regulator, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances.  Pass rated loans are loans that are not otherwise classified or criticized.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans .  Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due.  Loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual once the loan is 90 days past due or sooner if, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment of obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory authorities.

Nonperforming Loans.   Loans are considered nonperforming when they are placed on nonaccrual and/or when they are considered to be nonperforming troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) and/or when they are 90 days or greater past due and still accruing.  A TDR is a loan to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty that has been modified from its original terms and conditions in such a way that the Company is granting the borrower a concession of some kind.  Nonperforming TDRs include TDRs that do not have sufficient payment history (typically greater than nine months) to be considered performing or TDRs that have become 30 or more days past due.

Impaired Loans.   A loan is considered impaired when we have determined that we may be unable to collect payments of principal or interest when due under the terms of the loan.  In the process of identifying loans as impaired, we take into consideration factors which include payment history and status, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future.  Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired.  The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered on a case by case basis, after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrowers, including payment history. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio.  All TDRs are also classified as impaired loans and are included in the loans individually evaluated for impairment in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses.

Troubled debt restructurings.   Loans classified as TDRs totaled $3.8 million and $6.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in impaired loans.  The Company has granted in its TDRs a variety of concessions to borrowers in the form of loan modifications.  The modifications granted can generally be described in the following categories:

Rate Modification  : A modification in which the interest rate is changed.

Term Modification  : A modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments or frequency of payments is changed.

Payment Modification  : A modification in which the dollar amount of the payment is changed.  Interest only modifications in which a loan in converted to interest only payments for a period of time are included in this category.

Combination Modification  :  Any other type of modification, including the use of multiple categories above.

There were no new TDRs that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  There were no loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no TDR loans defaulted in the reporting period for which the default occurred within 12 months of the restructure date.

There were no post-modification changes for the recorded investment in TDR loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The allowance for loan losses allocated to TDRs at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $630,000 and $599,000, respectively.

Generally, any significant increases in the constant prepayment rate and discount rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the mortgage servicing rights will result in a negative fair value adjustment (and decrease in the fair value measurement).  Conversely, a decrease in the constant prepayment rate and discount rate will result in a positive fair value adjustment (and increase in the fair value measurement).  An increase in the weighted average life assumptions will result in a decrease in the constant prepayment rate and conversely, a decrease in the weighted average life will result in an increase of the constant prepayment rate.

A description of the valuation methodologies used for impaired loans and OREO is as follows:

Impaired Loans  - The fair value of collateral dependent loans is based on the current appraised value of the collateral or internally developed models utilizing a calculation of expected discounted cash flows which contain management s assumptions.

OREO   and Repossessed Assets    The fair value of OREO and repossessed assets is based on the current appraised value of the collateral.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and payable, and advance payments from borrowers for taxes and insurance  - The estimated fair value is equal to the carrying amount.

Available-for-sale ( AFS ) Securities    AFS securities are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices, if available.  If quoted market prices are not available, management utilizes third-party pricing services or broker quotations from dealers in the specific instruments.  Level 2 securities include those traded on an active exchange, as well as U.S. government and its agencies securities.  Level 3 securities include private label mortgage-backed securities.

Loans Held for Sale  - Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of fixed-rate residential loans is based on whole loan forward prices obtained from government sponsored enterprises. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans held for sale were carried at cost, as no impairment was required.

Loans  - The estimated fair value for all fixed rate loans is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows using the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities. The estimated fair value for variable rate loans is the carrying amount. The fair value for all loans also takes into account projected loan losses as a part of the estimate.

SOUND FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (unaudited) 

Mortgage Servicing Rights   The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined though a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates,  and delinquency rate assumptions as inputs.

FHLB stock  - The estimated fair value is equal to the par value of the stock, which approximates fair value.

Deposits  - The estimated fair value of deposit accounts (savings, demand deposit, and money market accounts) is the carrying amount. The fair values of fixed-maturity time certificates of deposit are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows using the current rate at which similar certificates would be issued.

Borrowings  - The fair value of borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Off-balance-sheet financial instruments  - The fair value for the Company s off-balance-sheet loan commitments are estimated based on fees charged to others to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and credit standing of the Company s customers. The estimated fair value of these commitments is not significant.

We assume interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of our normal operations. As a result, the fair values of our financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change, which may be favorable or unfavorable to us. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent necessary or possible to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed-rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by establishing early withdrawal penalties for certificates of deposit, creating interest rate floors for certain variable rate loans, adjusting terms of new loans and deposits, by borrowing at fixed rates for fixed terms and investing in securities with terms that mitigate our overall interest rate risk.

Note 6   Mortgage Servicing Rights

The unpaid principal balances of loans serviced for Fannie Mae at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, totaled approximately $356.9 million and $360.4 million, respectively, and was not included in the Company s financial statements. We also service loans for other financial institutions totaling $13.7 million.

A summary of the change in the balance of mortgage servicing rights during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):

(1)  Represents changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates

(2)  Represents changes due to collection or realization of expected cash flows over time.

The key economic assumptions used in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights at the dates indicated are as follows:

The amount of contractually specified servicing, late and ancillary fees earned and recorded in mortgage servicing income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income was $223,000 and $636,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and $202,000 and $671,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Note 7   Commitments and Contingencies

In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements.  These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.  These transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit.

Note 9   Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (which has been adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, reduced for average unallocated ESOP shares and average unvested restricted stock awards. Unvested share-based awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) at the same rate as common stockholders.  Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock awards and options) were exercised or converted to common stock, or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the Company's earnings.  Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period increased for the dilutive effect of unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock awards. The dilutive effect of the unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock awards is calculated under the treasury stock method utilizing the average market value of the Company's stock for the period.

Earnings per common share are summarized for the periods presented in the following table (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

There were no shares considered anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

General

References in this document to Sound Financial Bancorp refer to Sound Financial Bancorp, Inc. and its predecessor, Sound Financial, Inc., a federal corporation, and references to the "Bank" refer to Sound Community Bank.  References to "we," "us," "our" and the Company means Sound Financial Bancorp and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sound Community Bank, unless the context otherwise requires.

Sound Financial Bancorp, a Maryland corporation, is a bank holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Sound Community Bank.  Substantially all of Sound Financial Bancorp's business is conducted through Sound Community Bank, a Washington state-chartered commercial bank.  As a Washington commercial bank, the Bank's regulators are the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions ("WDFI") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").  The Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Sound Financial Bancorp.

Sound Community Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC.  At September 30, 2016, Sound Financial Bancorp had total consolidated assets of $566.2 million, net loans of $472.2 million, deposits of $463.5 million and stockholders' equity of $58.3 million.  The shares of Sound Financial Bancorp are traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "SFBC."  Our executive offices are located at 2005 5 th  Avenue, Suite 200, Seattle, Washington, 98121.

Our principal business consists of attracting retail and commercial deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one- to four-family residences (including home equity loans and lines of credit), commercial and multifamily, consumer and commercial business loans and construction and land loans.  We offer a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loan products, including manufactured home loans, floating home loans, automobile loans, boat loans and recreational vehicle loans.  As part of our business, we focus on residential mortgage loan originations, many of which we sell to Fannie Mae.  We sell the majority of these loans with servicing retained to maintain the direct customer relationship and to continue providing quality customer service to our borrowers.  We also originate loans which do not conform to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae ( non-conforming ) to be held in our loan portfolio or as held for sale with servicing released.  We originate and retain a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, including those secured by owner-occupied and non owner-occupied commercial real estate, multifamily property, manufactured home parks and construction and land development loans.

Critical Accounting Policies

Certain of our accounting policies are important to an understanding of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain.  Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances.  Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.  Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, accounting for other-than-temporary impairment of securities, accounting for mortgage servicing rights, accounting for other real estate owned and accounting for deferred income taxes.  Our methodologies for analyzing the allowance for loan losses,  other-than-temporary impairment, mortgage servicing rights, other real estate owned and deferred tax asset accounts are described in our 2015 Form 10-K.  There have been no significant changes in the Company s application of accounting policies since December 31, 2015 and no new significant policies adopted.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015

General  .     Total assets increased $25.4 million, or 4.7%, to $566.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $540.8 million at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily the result of a $17.6 million, or 3.8%, increase in the net loan portfolio and a $7.0 million, or 14.5%, increase in cash and cash equivalents.  The increase in the cash and cash equivalents was partially due to a $23.5 million, or 5.3%, increase in deposits, which also funded  the loan growth and a  $3.0 million, or 7.4%, decrease in borrowings to $37.4 million at  September 30, 2016     from $40.4 million at December 31, 2015. 

Cash and Securities  .   Cash and cash equivalents increased $7.0 million, or 14.5%, to $55.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $48.3 million at December 31, 2015. Available-for-sale securities, which consist primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities, increased $300,000, or 4.5%, to $7.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $6.7 million at December 31, 2015 as a result of purchases of municipal bonds of $1.3 million, partially offset by principal repayments on securities during the first nine months of the year.

Loans  .   Our gross loan portfolio increased $17.6 million, or 3.8%, to $477.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $459.5 million at December 31, 2015.

The following table reflects the changes in the types of loans in our portfolio at September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

The increases in our loan portfolio were primarily a result of strong loan demand.  At September 30, 2016, our loan portfolio remained well-diversified with commercial and multifamily real estate loans accounting for 35.6% of the portfolio.  One-to-four-family loans accounted for 31.7% of the portfolio.  Home equity, manufactured and other consumer loans accounted for 14.9% of the portfolio.  Construction and land loans accounted for 12.3% of the portfolio and commercial business loans account for the remaining 5.5% of total loans as of September 30, 2016.

Loans held for sale increased $333,000, or 15.9%, to $2.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in loans held for sale was a result of the timing of originations and sales between the two period ending dates.

Mortgage Servicing Rights  .   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in mortgage servicing rights recorded at fair value.    We record mortgage servicing rights on loans sold to Fannie Mae and other financial institutions with servicing retained and upon acquisition of a servicing portfolio.  We stratify our capitalized mortgage servicing rights based on the type, term and interest rates of the underlying loans.  Mortgage servicing rights are carried at fair value.  If the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights fluctuates significantly, our financial results could be materially impacted.

Nonperforming Assets.   At September 30, 2016, nonperforming assets totaled $5.8 million, or 1.02% of total assets, compared to $2.9 million, or 0.54% of total assets at December 31, 2015.

The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of nonperforming assets at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent and nonperforming TDRs, increased to $4.9 million or 1.02% of total loans at September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million or 0.46% of total loans, at December 31, 2015.  This increase reflects the inclusion of a $2.1 million  multifamily loan in Port Angeles, WA in nonaccrual loans  during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   The loan, while currently performing, was transferred into nonaccrual in the second quarter due to the uncertainty of full collection.  At September 30, 2016, we had a specific reserve of $354,000 on this credit to reflect impairment based on recent collateral valuation.

OREO  and repossessed assets increased in the first nine months of the year due to the addition of of three properties.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repossessed three single family 1-4 residences valued at $274,000 and we sold two properties valued at $161,000.  The aggregate loss on all sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,000. The aggregate gain on all sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,000.  The gain on sales of properties was offset by expenses related to OREO properties.  Our largest OREO at September 30, 2016 consisted of a commercial building with a recorded value of $600,000 located in Clallam County, Washington that we acquired as a part of the the Columbia Bank branch purchase.  Our next largest OREO property is a $170,000 one- to four- family property also located in Clallam County.

Allowance for Loan Losses  .   Our allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was $4.9 million, or 1.02% of total loans receivable compared to $4.6 million, or 1.01% of total loans receivable, at December 31, 2015.  The allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses that are probable and can be estimated on the date of evaluation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It is our best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio.  The increase in the allowance for loan losses compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily due to increased loan balances and the increase in non-performing loans.

The following table reflects the adjustments in our allowance during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

Specific loan loss reserves increased to $1.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $882,000 at December 31, 2015, while general loan loss reserves decreased to $3.6 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $3.8 million at December 31, 2015.   The increase in specific loan loss reserves was primarily due to the transfer of a $2.1 million  multifamily loan in Port Angeles, WA  during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to nonaccrual status.  This is o ur largest nonperforming loan as of September 30, 2016. The specific reserve for this loan is $354,000, which management believes is adequate to cover the expected loss on this loan.  The decrease in general loan loss reserves was due to lower historical loss rates.  Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $26,000, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to $105,000, or 0.03% of average loans on an annualized basis for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily due to improving economic conditions in our market area.  As of September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable and nonperforming loans was 1.02% and 99.79%, respectively, compared to 1.01% and 217.65%, respectively, at December 31, 2015.  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased due to a $2.7 million increase in nonperforming loans to $4.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million at December 31, 2015.

Deposits  .    Total deposits increased $23.5 million, or 5.3%, to $463.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $440.0 million at December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a $13.7 million, or 10.7%, increase in interest-bearing demand accounts, an $16.7 million, or 34.7% increase in noninterest-bearing demand accounts, and a $5.2 million, or 13.4%, increase in savings accounts.  These increases were partially offset by a $4.0 million, or 7.4%, decrease in money market accounts and an $8.9 million, or 5.3%, decrease in certificates of deposit.  The increases were the result of our continued emphasis on attracting low-cost core deposit accounts.  The decrease in money market accounts was in part the result of some customers shifting these funds into interest-bearing demand accounts .  The decrease in certificate of deposit accounts was primarily due to a decrease in public funds.

A summary of deposit accounts with the corresponding weighted average cost of funds is presented below (dollars in thousands):

(1)  Includes the amortization expense from the deposit premium paid on the purchase of deposits from Columbia State Bank in the third quarter of 2015.

Borrowings .  FHLB advances decreased $3.0 million, or 7.4%, to $37.5 million, with a weighted-average cost of 0.47 % at September 30, 2016, from $40.4 million, with a weighted-average cost of 0.39% at December 31, 2015.  The increase in average borrowing rate was due to a greater percentage of short term borrowings in the current period compared to December 31, 2015, as well as an increase to the overnight borrowing rate with the FHLB.  We rely on FHLB advances to fund interest-earning assets when deposits alone cannot fully fund interest-earning asset growth.  This reliance on borrowings, rather than deposits, may increase our overall cost of funds.

Stockholders' Equity  .   Total stockholders' equity increased $3.8 million, or 7.0%, to $58.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $54.5 million at December 31, 2015.  This increase primarily reflects $3.8 million in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 share-based compensation and the funds received from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the payment of cash dividends of $558,000 to common stockholders.

Comparison of Results of Operation for the Three and Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

General  .   Net income was $1.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $339,000 from the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reasons for the increase in net income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year were increases in net interest income and noninterest income, which were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.  Net income increased $244,000 to $3.8 million, or $1.48 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.6 million, or $1.38 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reasons for the increase in net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year was an increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense, and decreases to the fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights and gain on sale of loans. These decreases were partially offset by higher net interest income and a lower provision for loan losses.

Interest Income  .   Interest income increased $572,000, or 10.3%, to $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest income increased $2.0 million, or 12.0%, to $18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increases in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily reflect the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets for both periods and a higher weighted average yield on interest-earning assets for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.

Our weighted average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.67% and 4.82% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 4.85% and 4.69% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was due to an increase in the level of interest bearing cash as a percentage of total interest-bearing assets.  The increase in yield on interest-earning assets for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects the increase in the yield on our loan portfolio due to the acceleration of the accretion of net deferred loans on paid loans.  The weighted average yield on loans was 5.10% and 5.14% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 5.04% and 5.00% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The weighted average yield on available-for-sale securities was 0.59% and 0.60% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 0.51% and 0.57% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase in the average yields for both the interest bearing cash and the securities portfolio was due to the increase in the federal funds rate in December 2015 from 0.25% to 0.50%.

Interest Expense  .   Interest expense increased $45,000, or 6.6%, to $730,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $685,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest expense increased $101,000, or 4.9%, to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.69% and 0.68% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 0.67% and 0.68% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Interest expense on deposits increased $16,000, or 2.4%, to $678,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $662,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest expense on deposits increased $35,000, or 1.8%, to $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These increases resulted from higher average balances of interest-bearing deposits outstanding in both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.  Our weighted average cost of deposits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 0.59% and 0.60%, respectively, as compared to 0.62% and 0.63% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The decrease in average cost of deposits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of the re-pricing of matured certificates of deposit and increases in non-interest bearing deposits.

Interest expense on borrowings increased $29,000, or 126.1%, to $52,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $23,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest expense on borrowings increased $66,000, or 94.3%, to $136,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $70,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increases were a result of an increase in our average cost of borrowings to 0.57% and 0.55% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to 0.40% and 0.45% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, reflecting greater percentage of short term borrowings utilized during 2016, and an increase to the overnight borrowing rate with the FHLB due to the December 2015 increase in the federal funds rate.     We had a $2.1 million decrease and a $12.0 million increase in the average balances of FHLB advances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015.

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased $527,000 or 10.8%, to $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net interest income increased $1.9 million, or 13.0%, to $16.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from increased interest income due primarily to higher average loan balances.  Our average yield on loans receivable increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods last year due primarily to the accelerated accretion of net deferred loan fees on paid loans.  Our net interest margin was 4.19% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 4.12% and 4.10% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively . 

Provision for Loan Losse s.  We establish provisions for loan losses, which are charged to earnings, at a level required to reflect management s best estimate of the probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio.  In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers  ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, peer group data, prevailing economic conditions, and current factors.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as one-to four-family, small commercial and multifamily, home equity and consumer loans, are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors adjusted for current economic conditions and other relevant data.  Loans for which management has concerns about the borrowers  ability to repay, are evaluated individually, and specific loss allocations are provided for these loans when necessary.

There was no provision for loan losses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision of $100,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Provision for loan losses was $250,000 during nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a provision of $400,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The reduced provision  primarily reflects a decline in loan charge-offs and lower historical loss ratios, which were partially offset by higher average loan balances and changes in the composition of our loan portfolio.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the annualized percentage of net recoveries to average loans was 0.02%, compared to net charge-offs of 0.01% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the annualized percentage of net charge-offs to average loans decreased to 0.01%, from 0.03% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased to 1.02% at September 30, 2016 from 0.47% at September 30, 2015.  This increase reflects the inclusion, as discussed above, of a $2.1 million  multifamily loan in Port Angeles, Washington as a nonaccrual loan as of September 30, 2016.

While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Noninterest Income  .   Noninterest income increased $277,000, or 21.9%, to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as reflected below (dollars in thousands):

The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year was an increase in the net gain on sale of loans and increased service charges and fee income.

Noninterest income decreased $414,000, or 10.0%, to $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as reflected below (dollars in thousands):

The primary reason for the decrease in noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year was the negative change in the fair value adjustment on the mortgage servicing rights and the decrease in net gain on sale of loans.  The change in the fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights was primarily a result of the duration on the underlying loans being projected to shorten due to lower interest rates and increased refinance activity. The decrease in gain on sale of loans was primarily reflective of a lower volume of loans sold as well as a lower average premium on loans sold.  Mortgage servicing income decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period the prior year.  The decrease in mortgage servicing income was due to the turnover in the mortgage servicing portfolio and the rates associated with loans paid off and originated.

Noninterest Expense  .   Noninterest expense increased $368,000, or 8.4%, to $4.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $4.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015, as reflected below (dollars in thousands):

The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in operations expense.  Salaries and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation and benefit expense during the current period compared to the same period last year.  Operations expense increased due to higher depreciation and general administration expenses.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in regulatory assessments and occupancy expense.   Regulatory assessments decreased due, in part, to lower fees paid to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions.  Occupancy expense declined due to higher maintenance costs in the same period last year.

Noninterest expense increased $1.0 million, or 8.3%, to $13.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $12.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as reflected below (dollars in thousands):

The increase in noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense and, to a lesser degree, operations expense.  Salaries and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase in full time equivalent employees (FTE) during the period and higher medical benefit expense.  The increase in FTE was due to additional staffing in compliance and loan operations.  Operations expense increased due to higher depreciation, credit administration and general administration expense.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in losses and expenses on OREO and repossessed assets, and regulatory assessments.  Losses and expenses on OREO and repossessed assets decreased primarily due to improving values for real estate in the markets where we lend  as well as lower levels of expenses related to OREO and other repossessed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Regulatory assessments decreased, due in part, to lower fees paid to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions.

The efficiency ratio, which is noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income,  for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 improved to 68.19%, compared to 69.12% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and was 69.67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 69.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The improvement in the three month peiod was primarily due to higher net interest income and non interest income offset by higher non-interest expense. The slight change in the efficiency ratio in the nine month peiod was primarily due to higher non-interest expense and lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income.

Income Tax Expense .   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred income tax expense of $757,000 and $2.0 million on our pre-tax income as compared to $560,000 and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 34.2% and 34.1%, respectively.  The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were 33.4% and 32.0%, respectively.

Liquidity

The Management Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K contains an overview of Sound Financial Bancorp s and the Bank s liquidity management, sources of liquidity and cash flows.  This discussion updates that disclosure for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The Bank s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and borrowings.  While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.  The Bank s primary investing activity is loan originations.  The Bank maintains liquidity levels it believes to be adequate to fund loan commitments, investment opportunities, deposit withdrawals and other financial commitments.  At September 30, 2016, the Bank had $62.3 million in cash and investment securities available for sale and $2.4 million in loans held for sale generally available for its cash needs.  Also, based on existing collateral pledged, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $113.4 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances, $33.2 million through the Federal Reserve s Discount Window, $10.0 million through a Fed Funds line at TIB-The Independent BankersBank, $9.0 million through a Fed Funds line at Zions Bank and $2.0 million through a Fed Funds line at Pacific Coast Banker s Bank.  The Bank uses these sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments.  At September 30, 2016, outstanding loan commitments, including unused lines and letters of credit totaled $71.4 million.  Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at September 30, 2016, totaled $92.7 million.  Based on our competitive pricing, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the Bank.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $7.0 million to $55.3 million as of September 30, 2016, from $48.3 million as of December 31, 2015.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Net cash of $18.6 million was used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and consisted principally of investment purchase and loan originations, net of principal repayments.  The $20.5 million of cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of a $23.5 million net increase in deposits offset by a $3.0 million net decrease in FHLB advances.

As a separate legal entity from the Bank, Sound Financial Bancorp must provide for its own liquidity.  At September 30, 2016, Sound Financial Bancorp, on an unconsolidated basis, had $1.6 million in cash, noninterest-bearing deposits and liquid investments generally available for its cash needs.  Sound Financial Bancorp s principal source of liquidity is dividends from the Bank.

Except as set forth above, management is not aware of any trends, events, or uncertainties that will have, or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on liquidity, capital resources or operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Activities

In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements.  These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.  These transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

A summary of our off-balance sheet loan commitments at September 30, 2016, is as follows (in thousands):

Capital

Sound Community Bank is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by regulations of the FDIC.  Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Bank became subject to new minimum capital adequacy adopted by the FDIC, which creates a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, increases the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changes the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, creates an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changes what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. The Bank is also required to maintain additional levels of CET1 over the minimum risk-based capital levels before it may pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.

The minimum requirements are a ratio of CET1 to total risk-weighted assets ("CET1 risk-based ratio") of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0%, and a leverage ratio of 4.0%.

In addition to the capital requirements, there are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to a certain transition periods.  These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital.  The Bank does not have any of these instruments.  Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are be deducted from capital, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017.  CET1 consists of Tier 1 capital less all capital components that are not considered common equity.  In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a transition period end December 31, 2017.  Because of our asset size, we are not are considered an "advanced approaches banking organization" and have elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations.

The requirements also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure.  These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.  This capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented to an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in January 2019.

Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% (new), a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged).

Based on its capital levels at September 30, 2016, Sound Community Bank exceeded these requirements as of that date.  Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is to maintain a "well-capitalized" status as Sound Community Bank under the regulatory capital categories of the FDIC.  Based on capital levels at September 30, 2016, Sound Community Bank was considered to be well-capitalized under applicable regulatory requirements.  Management monitors the capital levels to provide for current and future business opportunities and to maintain Sound Community Bank's "well-capitalized" status.

The actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios calculated for Sound Community Bank at September 30, 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

For a bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.  If Sound Financial Bancorp was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in assets, at September 30, 2016, Sound Financial Bancorp would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.   The estimated regulatory capital ratios calculated for Sound Financial Bancorp as of September 30, 2016 were 10.47% for Tier 1 leverage-based capital, 12.73% for both Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 Capital to risk-based assets and 13.84% for total risk-based capital.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company provided information about market risk in Item 7A of its 2015 Form 10-K.  There have been no material changes in our market risk since our 2015 Form 10-K.

Item 4.

Controls and Procedures

(a) 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

An evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act")), as of September 30, 2016, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company's senior management. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and to improve the Company s controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company's business. While we believe the present design of the disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve this goal, future events affecting our business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures.

The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

(b) 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
