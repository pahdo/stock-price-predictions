  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

Note 1.  Summary of Significant     Accounting Policies 
  Centrue Financial Corporation is a bank holding company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.  When we use the terms  Centrue,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our,  we mean Centrue Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiary. When we use the term the  Bank,  we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank. The Company and the Bank provide a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers located in markets extending from the far western and southern suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area across Central Illinois and metropolitan St. Louis.  These services include demand, time, and savings deposits; business and consumer lending; and mortgage banking.  The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions providing financial services.  Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies. 
  Basis of presentation 
  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and general practice within the banking industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates which are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the fair value of investment securities and other-than-temporary impairment of securities, the determination of the allowance for loan losses and valuation of other real estate owned. 
  For further information with respect to significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements, refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and Centrue Bank.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation and certain   2015   amounts have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   presentation.  The annualized results of operations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  All financial information in the following tables is in thousands (000s), except share and per share data. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments which are necessary to fairly present the results for the interim periods presented have been included. 
  Reverse Stock Split 
  Common shares and per share amounts for all periods shown have been restated to reflect the impact of the 1:  30   reverse stock split the Company completed effective May 29, 2015. 
  Capital Event 
  On March 31, 2015, the Company completed the issuance of   $76.0 million   of new common stock in a private placement offering,   $68.2 million   of net proceeds after issuance and registration costs of   $7.8 million  . A total of   6.3 million   shares were sold in the offering at a price of   $12.00   per share. In conjunction with the stock offering the Company used the proceeds in part to pay   $4.9 million   in accrued but unpaid interest on its subordinated debentures, redeemed all   $32.7 million   of Series C Preferred Stock for   $19.0 million  , settled   $10.3 million   in notes payable with a financial institution for   $8.5 million   and made a   $36.0 million   capital contribution into Centrue Bank. The remaining proceeds have been and will be used for general corporate purposes. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In June 2016 the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, commonly referred to as CECL. The provisions of the update eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold under current GAAP which requires reserves to be based on an incurred loss methodology. Under CECL reserves required for financial assets measured at amortized cost will reflect an organization s estimate of all expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial asset and thereby require the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate future credit losses. Because CECL encompasses all financial assets carried at amortized cost, the requirement that reserves be established based on an organization s reasonable and supportable estimate of expected credit losses extends to held to maturity (HTM) debt securities. Under the provisions of the update credit losses recognized on available for sale (AFS) debt securities will be presented as an allowance as opposed to a write-down. In addition, CECL will modify the accounting for purchased loans, with credit deterioration since origination, so that reserves are established at the date of acquisition for purchased loans. Under current GAAP a purchased loan s contractual balance is adjusted to fair value through a credit discount and no reserve is recorded on the purchased loan upon acquisition. Since under CECL reserves will be established for purchased loans at the time of acquisition the accounting for purchased loans is made more comparable to the accounting for originated loans. Finally, increased disclosure requirements under CECL oblige organizations to present the currently required credit quality disclosures disaggregated by the year of origination or vintage.  FASB expects that the evaluation of underwriting standards and credit quality trends by financial statement users will be enhanced with the additional  
  
   6 

    CENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

vintage disclosures. For public business entities that are SEC filers the amendments of the update are effective beginning January 1, 2020. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of CECL on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as its required disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.)  The guidance in this update affects any entity that issues share-based payment awards to its employees and is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.   
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2016-02, Leases) creating FASB Topic 842, Leases.  The guidance is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring more disclosures related to leasing transactions.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  Management is currently evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an update, ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The guidance in this update requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Management is currently determining the impact of this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  Qualitative and quantitative information is required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update will become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In evaluating this standard, management has determined that the majority of revenue earned by the Company are from revenue streams not included in the scope of this standard and thus no material impact is expected with the adoption of this standard.  
   
  Note 2.  Earnings Per Share 
  A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators for earnings per common share computations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented below.  Common shares, options, and per share amounts for all periods shown have been restated to reflect the impact of the 1:  30   reverse stock split the Company completed effective May 29, 2015. Options to purchase   498   and   3,488   shares of common stock were outstanding for   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively; but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price was greater than the average market price and, therefore, were anti-dilutive. Of the   33,321   shares of restricted stock units issued,   3,190   shares and   1,554   shares were considered dilutive for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.

Note 3.  Securities 
  The primary strategic objective related to the Company's securities portfolio is to assist with liquidity and interest rate risk management.  The fair value of the securities classified as available-for-sale was   $183.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $171.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The carrying value of securities classified as restricted (Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock) was   $10.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company does not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity. 
  The following table summarizes the fair value of available-for-sale securities, the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, and the amortized cost at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Note 4.  Loans 
  The major classifications of loans follow: 

The credit quality indicator utilized by the Company to internally analyze the loan portfolio is the internal risk rating.  Internal risk ratings of   0   to   5   are considered pass credits, a risk rating of a   6   is special mention, a risk rating of a   7   is substandard, and a risk rating of an   8   is doubtful. Loans classified as pass credits have no material weaknesses and are performing as agreed.  Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
  The following table presents the commercial loan portfolio by internal risk rating:

Troubled Debt Restructurings:   
  The Company had troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) of   $0.23 million   and   $0.24 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Specific reserves were immaterial at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016   nonaccrual TDR loans were   $0.23 million   and   $0.24 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  There were   no   TDRs on accrual at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The Company had   no   commitments to lend additional amounts to a customer with an outstanding loan that is classified as TDR as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Over the course of a period, the terms of certain loans may be modified as troubled debt restructurings.  The modification of the terms of such loans may include   one   or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan to a below market rate or the payment modification to interest only.  A modification involving a reduction of the stated interest rate of the

loan would be for periods ranging from   6 months   to   16 months  . During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings, compared to the same   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015   when there were   two   senior lien 1-4 family residential loan modified as troubled debt restructurings with a  pre-modification and post-modification recorded investment of   $0.1 million  .  

The troubled debt restructurings described above did not have a material impact to the allowance for loan losses and did not result in any additional charge-offs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is   90 days   contractually past due under the modified terms.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   there were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within   twelve months   following the modification.  
  The Company evaluates loan modifications to determine if the modification constitutes a troubled debt restructure. A loan modification constitutes a troubled debt restructure if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company grants a concession it would not otherwise consider. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its loans with the Company s debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting guidelines.  TDRs are separately identified for impairment disclosures.  If a loan is considered to be collateral dependent loan, the TDR is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral.

The following table represents information related to loan portfolio aging: 

Nonperforming loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. There were   no   loans past due over   90 days   and still accruing interest at   September 30, 2016   or at   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Note 5.  Fair Value 
  The Company measures, monitors, and discloses certain of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
  The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into   three   broad levels based on the reliability of the input assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements and the categorization of where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy is based on the  
  
   18 

    CENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:  
  Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.  
  Level 2 - Observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  
  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
  The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 
  Securities 
  Available for Sale Securities.    The fair value of securities available for sale is determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs).  If the securities could not be priced using quoted market prices, observable market activity or comparable trades, the financial market was considered not active and the assets were classified as Level 3.   
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    
  The following table summarizes, by measurement hierarchy, the various assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  The following table summarizes, by measurement hierarchy, financial assets of the Company that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value.  Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses.  For collateral dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  
  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification.  Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.

Impaired loans carried at fair value had a net carrying amount of   $0.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which is made up of the outstanding balance of   $1.0 million   with   $0.6 million   specific loan loss allocation.   The effect of these impaired loans carried at fair value on the provision for loans losses was   $0.6 million   for the   nine   month period.  In   2015   impaired loans carried at fair value had a net carrying amount of   $0.6 million   which was made up of the outstanding balance of   $0.9 million   with a specific loan loss allocation of   $0.3 million   during   2015  , resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of   $0.1 million   for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The majority of the Bank's impaired loans are collateralized by real estate.  
  Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.  Any write-downs in the carrying value of a property at the time of acquisition are charged against the allowance for loan losses.  These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of other real estate owned. Any write-downs of the properties subsequent to acquisition, as well as gains or losses on disposition and income or expense from the operations of other real estate owned, are recognized in operating results in the period they are realized.  Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
  OREO properties measured at fair value, less costs to sell, had a net carrying amount of   $2.9 million   which is made up of the outstanding balance of   $3.6 million  , net of a valuation allowance of   $0.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This compares to   2015   when OREO properties with an outstanding balance of   $2.9 million   was written down to a fair value of   $1.7 million  . 
  The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

Other assets and liabilities of the Company that are not defined as financial instruments are not included in the above disclosures, such as property and equipment.  In addition, nonfinancial instruments typically not recognized in financial statements nevertheless may have value but are not included in the above disclosures.  These include, among other items, the estimated earning potential of core deposit accounts, the earnings potential of loan servicing rights, the earnings potential of the trust operations, customer goodwill and similar items. 
  The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows: 
  (a) Cash and Cash Equivalents  
  The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ;   $44.7 million   and   $27.7 million   was classified as Level 1. 
  (b) Restricted securities  
  It is not practical to determine the fair value of restricted securities due to the restrictions placed on its transferability.  
  (c) Loans 
  Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows: Fair values for loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.  Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.  
  The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
  (d) Deposits  
  The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 2. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
  
   24 

    CENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

(e) Short-term Borrowings  
  The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings, generally maturing within ninety days, approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
  (f) Other Borrowings  
  The fair values of the Company s long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification.   
  The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.  
  (g) Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable 
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification which is consistent with the underlying asset/liability they are associated with.  
  (h) Off-balance Sheet Instruments 
  Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material. 
   
  Note 6.  Borrowed Funds and Debt Obligations 
  The scheduled maturities of advances from the FHLB at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     no   FHLB advances had any call provisions.  The Company had   two   variable rate advances at   September 30, 2016  , both at   0.25%  , and   none   at year-end   2015  . The remaining advances are at fixed rates ranging from   1.06%   to   2.46%   at   September 30, 2016   and   0.21%   to   3.64%   at year-end   2015  . 
  In connection with the Company completing a   $76.0 million   recapitalization event on March 31, 2015, a settlement of obligations involving a financial institution was reached in which the Company recognized a gain of   $1.8 million   representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration issued in the settlement transaction and the carrying value of the amounts due to a financial institution. As a result, the gain has been included as   gain on extinguishment of debt   within income from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the period ended March 31, 2015 and year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 1 for additional disclosure related to the recapitalization event. 
   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   outstanding loan agreements.  
   
  Note 7.  Income Taxes 
  In accordance with current income tax accounting guidance, the Company assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets (DTAs) based on consideration of all available evidence using a  more likely than not  standard. The most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to (1) net operating loss carryforwards and (2) the allowance for loan losses.   
  
   25 

    CENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of DTAs were evaluated. The ultimate realization of DTAs is based on the Company s ability to carryback net operating losses to prior tax  periods, tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible, the reversal of deductible temporary differences that can be offset by taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.  
  After evaluating all of the factors previously summarized and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence, the Company has determined that   no   valuation allowance was necessary as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   
  Below is a summary of items included in the deferred tax inventory as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Note 8.  Share Based Compensation 
  In April 2003, the Company adopted the 2003 Option Plan.  Under the 2003 Option Plan, as amended on April 24, 2007, nonqualified options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and/or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and outside directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to purchase the Company's common stock at an exercise price to be determined by the executive and compensation committee.  Pursuant to the 2003 Option Plan,   19,000   shares of the Company's unissued common stock had been reserved and were available for issuance upon the exercise of options and rights granted under the 2003 Option Plan.  The granted options have an exercise period of   seven   to   ten   years from the date of grant. 
  In May 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan.  Under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan nonqualified options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and/or stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and outside directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to purchase the Company's common stock at an exercise price to be determined by the compensation committee.  A total of   430,000   shares have been made available under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan. There are currently   356,236   shares available to grant. 
  There were   33,321   units of restricted stock granted at a grant date fair value of   $16.72   per unit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . At September 30, 2016,   none   of the restricted stock units were vested. There were   40,443   shares of restricted stock granted for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   26 

    CENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

There was   no   compensation cost charged against income for the stock options portion of the equity incentive plans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  There was   $0.08 million   compensation cost charged against income for the restricted stock portion of the equity incentive plan for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $0.5 million   charged for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below.  Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company s common stock prior to its deregistration.  The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior.  (Employee and management options are tracked separately.)  The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable.  The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. There were   no   options granted for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  A status summary of the option plan as of   September 30, 2016   and changes during the period ended on that date are presented below: 

Options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and year-end   2015   were as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $0.5 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested shares granted under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan. 
   
  Note 9.  Regulatory Matters 
  The Company and Centrue Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies that involve the quantitative measure of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Centrue Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, Tier 1 capital and Common Equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), and, for the Bank, Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the regulations).  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may cause regulatory bodies to initiate certain discretionary and/or mandatory actions that, if undertaken, may have a direct material

effect on our financial statements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Centrue Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject, including the guidelines to be considered  well capitalized.  
  On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved rules that implement the  Basel III  regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and conservation buffer of   2.5%   of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over   four years   beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of   0.625%   of risk-weighted assets for 2016,   1.25%   for 2017,   1.875%   for 2018, and   2.5%   for 2019 and thereafter.  Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Capital ratios shown for   September 30, 2016   are in excess of the Basel III 2016 phase-in level for the capital conservation buffer. 
  On February 16, 2016 the Company received a formal order terminating the written agreement between the Company, the Bank, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

The following management discussion and analysis ( MD A ) is intended to address the significant factors affecting the Company s results of operations and financial condition for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments which are necessary to fairly present the results for the interim periods presented have been included.  The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.  When we use the terms  Centrue,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our,  we mean Centrue Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the  Bank,  we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary, Centrue Bank.  
  The MD A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and the accompanying notes thereto.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  All financial information in the following tables is displayed in thousands (000s), except per share data. 
   
  General 
  Centrue Financial Corporation is a bank holding company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company provides a full range of products and services to individual and corporate customers extending from the far western and southern suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area across Central Illinois down to the metropolitan St. Louis area. These products and services include demand, time, and savings deposits; lending; mortgage banking, brokerage, asset management, and trust services. Brokerage, asset management, and trust services are provided to our customers on a referral basis to third party providers. The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions, including banks, thrifts and credit unions, as well as nonfinancial institutions providing financial services. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiary, Centrue Bank, are subject to regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies. 
  On June 17, 2016, Centrue Bank completed the sales of its Fairview Heights, Aviston, and St. Rose, Illinois branches. The sales resulted in a reduction of $51.7 million of deposits, $13.1 million of loans and $5.1 million of fixed assets. These transactions generated a net after tax gain of $1.1 million. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Information about our critical accounting policies and estimates that are of particular significance to the Company are included under Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no changes during   2016   to the critical accounting policies listed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Results of Operations 
  Net Income 
  Net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   equaled   $1.1 million   or   $0.15   per common diluted share as compared to net income of   $1.1 million   or   $0.11   per common diluted share in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company had net income of   $4.1 million   or   $0.59   per common diluted share as compared to net income of   $4.0 million   or   $3.68   per common diluted share for the same period in   2015  .       
  The results for the first   nine   months of   2016   were positively impacted by the sale of three branches generating a net after tax gain on sale of $1.1 million. During the first   nine   months of   2015  , the Company had a $1.8 million gain on extinguishment of debt, representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration issued in the settlement transaction and the carrying value of the amounts due to a financial institution in connection with the settlement obligation. 
  Net Interest Income/ Margin    
  Net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for the funding sources used to finance these assets. Changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and rates earned and paid, respectively, on those assets and liabilities. The net yield on total interest-earning assets, also referred to as net interest margin, represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin measures how efficiently the Company uses its earning assets and underlying capital. The Company s long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital risks. For purposes of this discussion, both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax-exempt securities and loans. 
  Fully tax equivalent net interest income for the   third   quarter   2016   totaled   $7.2 million  , representing   an increase   of   $0.4 million   or   5.88%   compared to   $6.8 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This increase in income is primarily due to an increase in interest earning assets. 
  The net interest margin was   3.38%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , representing   an increase   of   four   basis points from the   3.34%   recorded in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The improvement in the net interest margin is being driven by the growth in the loan portfolio. 
  Fully tax equivalent net interest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $21.7 million  , representing   an increase   of   $2.4 million   or   12.44%   compared to   $19.3 million   earned during the same period in   2015  .  The net interest margin was   3.45%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , representing   an increase   of   three   basis points from   3.42%   recorded in the same period of   2015  . The increase in net interest income and the net interest margin was driven by the same factor impacting the third quarter.

Provision for Loan Losses 
  The amount of the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluations of the loan portfolio, with particular attention directed toward nonperforming, impaired and other potential problem loans.  During these evaluations, consideration is also given to such factors as management's evaluation of specific loans, the level and composition of impaired loans, other nonperforming loans, other identified potential problem loans, historical loss experience, results of examinations by regulatory agencies, results of the independent asset quality review process, the market value of collateral, the estimate of discounted cash flows, the strength and availability of guarantees, concentrations of credits and various other factors, including concentration of credit risk in various industries and current economic conditions. 
  There was no provision for loan losses taken during both the   third   quarter   2016   and   2015  .  As for the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company recorded   $0.3 million   for provision for loan losses in comparison to   none   for the same period in   2015  . The lack of need for a provision charge in the   third   quarter   2016   was driven by the following factors: 
             
    Trends in, and the level of, recoveries realized 
                
    Continued improvements in asset quality metrics 
     Management continues to update collateral values and evaluate the level of specific allocations for impaired loans.  As impaired loans have moved through the liquidation process, many of the previously established specific allocations have been charged off. 
  Noninterest Income 
  Noninterest income consists of a wide variety of fee-based revenues, including bank-related service charges on deposits, mortgage revenues and increases in cash surrender value on bank-owned life insurance.  Noninterest income totaled   $2.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Excluding gains related to the sale of branches, OREO, securities and other irregularly occurring income, noninterest income decreased $0.2 million. The $0.2 million decrease is mainly attributed to a decrease in income from service charges and from real estate owned.  
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , noninterest income totaled   $9.0 million  , compared to   $9.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . Excluding gains related to the sale of branches, OREO, securities and other non-recurring gains, noninterest income decreased $0.5 million. The $0.5 million decrease is attributed to a decrease in mortgage banking income along with the same reasons as stated for the quarter. 
  Noninterest Expense 
  Noninterest expense is comprised primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, and other operating expense.  Total noninterest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $7.7 million  , compared to   $8.8 million   recorded during the same period in   2015  . Excluding OREO valuation adjustments and other irregularly occurring items from both periods, noninterest expense levels decreased by $0.1 million, or 1.3%.  This $0.1 million decrease was mainly driven by lower FDIC insurance premiums, loan processing and collection costs, marketing and OREO carrying costs. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , noninterest expense totaled   $23.7 million  , compared to   $25.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . Excluding OREO valuation adjustments recorded in both periods and other non-recurring items, noninterest expense levels decreased by $0.2 million, or 0.8%.  This $0.2 million decrease was attributed to the same reasons as stated above. 
  Applicable Income Taxes 
  The Company recorded $2.6 million in income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   on pre-tax income of $6.7 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 38.8%. This increase from the 35.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due to the execution of a tax planning strategy. The Company s effective tax rate was lower than the combined statutory rate of 38.9% due to several factors. First, the Company derives interest income from municipal securities and loans, which are exempt from federal tax and certain U.S. government agency securities, which are exempt from state tax. Second, the Company derives income from bank owned life insurance policies, which is exempt from federal and state tax. Finally, state income taxes are recorded net of the federal tax benefit, which lowers the combined effective tax rate. 
  The Company recorded an immaterial tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 despite having a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. This was due to estimated Alternative Minimum Tax due on taxable income that could not be offset with net operating loss carry-forwards or credits per IRS guidelines.  Excluding this expense, no tax expense or benefit was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Financial Condition 
  General 
  Following are highlights of the   September 30, 2016   balance sheet when compared to   December 31, 2015  : 
  Securities.    The primary strategic objective of the Company s   $183.6 million   securities available-for-sale from   September 30, 2016  , which excludes restricted securities, is to minimize interest rate risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and maximize return. In managing the securities portfolio, the Company minimizes any credit risk and avoids investments in sophisticated and complex investment products. The portfolio includes several callable agency debentures, adjustable rate mortgage pass-throughs, municipal bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations. Collateralized mortgage obligations currently owned are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. The Company does not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity. 
  The Company s financial planning anticipates income streams generated by the securities portfolio based on normal maturity and reinvestment. Securities classified as available-for-sale, carried at fair value, were   $183.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $171.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company also holds Federal Reserve Board and Federal Home Loan Bank stock which are classified as restricted securities of   $10.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $9.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Loans.    Total loans, including loans held for sale, equaled   $666.8 million  , representing an increase of $21.7 million, or 3.36% from   December 31, 2015  .  The net increase from year-end   2015   was related to a combination of new organic loan growth and deeper lending relationships with existing customers that outpaced the $13.1 million in loans that were sold as part of the branch sales and paydowns on existing loans. Competition for new commercial loan opportunities and loan renewals continues to be strong and pressures loan yields.   
  Deposits.    Total deposits equaled   $761.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $718.5 million   recorded at   December 31, 2015  . The   September 30, 2016   deposit balance represents an increase of   $42.5 million   or   5.92%   from   December 31, 2015  .  The net increase from year-end   2015   was largely related to an increase in brokered deposits and public fund accounts. On June 17, 2016, the Company sold three branches which included $51.7 million of deposits. 
  Nonperforming Assets 
  The Company's financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio, unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status.  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectibility of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans.  If a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the loan does not generate current period income for the Company and any amounts received are generally applied first to principal and then to interest.  It is the policy of the Company not to renegotiate the terms of a loan because of a delinquent status.  Rather, a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond 90 days.  
  The classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible, in whole or in part.  The Bank makes a determination as to collectibility on a case-by-case basis and considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans.  The final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation.  Alternatives that are typically considered to collect nonaccrual loans are foreclosure, collection under guarantees, loan restructuring, or judicial collection actions. 
  Each of the Company's commercial loans is assigned a rating based upon an internally developed grading system.  A separate credit administration department also reviews selected grade assignments on a quarterly basis.  Management continuously monitors nonperforming, impaired, and past due loans in an effort to prevent further deterioration of these loans.  In addition to our credit administration department, the Company has an independent loan review function which is separate from the lending function and is responsible for the review of new and existing loans.

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

The following table sets forth a summary of nonperforming assets: 

Total nonperforming assets declined   $6.5 million   to   $7.9 million  , or   0.79%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2016   from   $14.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Total nonperforming assets included   $5.5 million   of foreclosed assets and repossessed real estate, and   $2.3 million   of nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.4 million   of foreclosed assets and   $6.0 million   of nonaccrual loans at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Nonperforming Loans 
  Nonperforming loans (nonaccrual, 90 days past due and troubled debt restructures) decreased   $3.7 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , driven by the resolution of a large non-performing loan relationship.  
  The level of nonperforming loans to end of period loans was   0.35%   as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   0.93%   as of   December 31, 2015  . As a result of the decrease in the nonperforming loans, the allowance to nonperforming loan coverage ratio increased to   388.50%   for the period ended   September 30, 2016   from   143.02%   for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the allowance for loan losses was   $9.0 million  , or   1.35%   of total loans, as compared to   $8.6 million  , or   1.33%   of total loans, at   December 31, 2015  . The Company recorded   $0.3 million   of provision to the allowance for loan losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Management believes we are recognizing losses in our portfolio through provisions and charge-offs as credit developments warrant.    
  Liquidity 
  The Company manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. In addition to the normal inflow of funds from core-deposit growth together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments, the Company utilizes other short-term funding sources such as brokered time deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, overnight federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short-term deposits from public entities, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. 
  The Company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases, which vary depending upon the time period. As the time period is expanded, other data is factored in, including estimated loan funding requirements, estimated loan payoffs, investment portfolio maturities or calls, and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs. 
  The Company classifies all of its securities as available-for-sale, thereby maintaining significant liquidity. The Company s liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the Company s loan portfolio, resulting in a steady stream of loan repayments. In managing its investment portfolio, the Company provides for staggered maturities so that cash flows are provided as such investments mature. 
  The Company s cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows provided by operating and financing activities offset by cash flows used in investing activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of   $17.1 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

For the period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company experienced a positive net cash flow of   $85.9 million   in financing activities primarily due to the net increase in deposits. In contrast, net cash outflows of   $76.6 million   were used by investing activities due to the sale of branches and a net increase in loans. Net cash provided by operating activities was   $7.8 million  .  
   
  Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingencies, and Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
  The Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet financial instruments.  The following tables summarize the Company s contractual cash obligations and other commitments and off balance sheet instruments as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $142.7 million   in outstanding loan commitments including outstanding commitments for various lines of credit and   $2.1 million   of standby letters of credit.  
   
  Capital Resources 
  Stockholders' Equity 
  Stockholders' equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $125.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $4.6 million   from   $121.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The change in stockholders  equity during   2016   was the result of net income for the period and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Preferred dividends of   $0.2 million   where paid on Series D preferred stock during the period ended September 30, 2016.

  (TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) 

Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Sensitivity Management 
  The Company performs a net interest income analysis as part of its asset/liability management practices.  The net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates.  This analysis assesses the risk of changes in net interest income in the event of a sudden and sustained 100, 200 and 300 basis point increase in market interest rates or a 100 basis point decrease in market rates. The interest rates scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market movements.  The tables below present the Company's projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

As shown above, the effect of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   would increase the Company s net interest income by   $0.9 million   or   3.10%  .  The effect of an immediate 100 basis point decrease in rates would decrease the Company s net interest income by   $1.4 million   or   5.01%  .

  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures       
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It should be noted that in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company has designed its disclosure controls and procedures to reach a level of reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, based on the evaluation described above, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at reaching that level of reasonable assurance. 
  There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 31.1 
  CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PURSUANT 
  TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 

I, Kurt R. Stevenson, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Centrue Financial Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this     report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15 d - 15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c)
