   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   

1.        
 
       BASIS OF PRESENTATION      
     
  DCP Holding Company (the  Company ) is the parent holding company of three wholly-owned subsidiaries which include Dental Care Plus, Inc., an Ohio corporation; Insurance Associates Plus, Inc., an Ohio corporation, and Adenta, Inc., a Kentucky corporation. Dentists who participate in one or more of the Dental Care Plus networks own a majority of the Company s Redeemable Common Shares. The Company s Redeemable Common Shares are also owned by retired dentists, Company board members, non-dentist individuals and employees. The Company primarily offers to employer groups of all sizes health maintenance organization ( HMO ), participating provider organization ( PPO ) and indemnity plans for dental care services and vision benefit plans. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this report have been prepared by the Company without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in the interim financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited 2015 financial statements and notes thereto as included in the DCP Holding Company annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Commission on March 23, 2016. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements. Certain financial information that is required in the annual financial statements may not be required for interim financial reporting purposes and has been condensed or omitted. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.   
     
  The accounting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

2.    
 
   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      
     
  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in the notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. While management believes that the procedures followed in preparation of interim financial information are reasonable, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include estimates for items such as changes in claims payable, income tax accounts, deferred acquisition costs, deferred share-based compensation and accrued expenses and various other liability accounts. Any adjustments related to such estimates during the reporting period were of a normal recurring nature.     
     
    Premium Revenue       
     
   Fully-Insured  Membership contracts are written on an annual or multi-year basis and are subject to cancellation by the employer group upon thirty days written notice. The Company s unearned premium revenue was approximately $51,951,000 and $32,631,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and primarily relates to the estimated premium revenue associated with the remaining contract periods. Related unbilled amounts recorded in unbilled accounts receivable were approximately $50,257,000 and $30,955,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Premiums are due monthly in advance and are recognized evenly as revenue during the period in which the Company is obligated to provide services to members. Any amounts not received by the end of a reporting period are recorded as accounts receivable by the Company. Any premiums received prior to the beginning of a reporting period are recognized as premiums received in advance and are included in unearned premium revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Premiums received in advance were approximately $1,694,000 and $1,676,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Management has determined that as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, no premium deficiency reserve is required. The Company s premium deficiency reserve analysis includes an allocation of investment income.

Self-Insured  The Company provides administrative and claims processing services, benefit plan design, and access to its provider networks for an administrative fee to self-insured groups. The Company has no underwriting risk arising from the provision or cost of any services provided to the self-insured groups. The Company recognizes and records self-insured premiums on a gross basis because: (i) the Company is the primary obligor in its contractual relationships with self-insured employers and dental service providers, (ii) the Company establishes the pricing for the services provided, (iii) the Company controls the selection of and the relationships with the dental service providers, and (iv) the Company is involved in the determination of dental service specifications. Self-insured premium revenue is recognized upon the payment of claims for self-insured members in accordance with agreements with self-insured employers and is included in premium revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  
     
  Third-party administration fee revenue ( ASO fees ) is recognized monthly when earned and is normally based on annual contracts with the self-insured groups. ASO fees are charged to self-insured employer groups monthly on a per subscriber per month basis and included in premium revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.   
     
   Corporate, All Other  ASO fees also include the administrative fees the Company earns relative to the dental indemnity and vision products that are underwritten by third-party insurance carriers.   
     
    Healthcare Services Expense   Healthcare services expense is recognized on a monthly basis. In the case of the fully-insured dental HMO and indemnity and dental PPO segments, healthcare services expense is calculated by taking the paid claims associated with the fully-insured membership and adjusting this amount for the change in the claims payable liability determined using actuarial estimates. For the self-insured dental segment, the healthcare services expense is based solely on the paid claims for the self-insured membership.   
     
    Investments   The Company invests in certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and money market funds. The Company classifies all investments as available-for-sale. The Company engages a fixed income portfolio manager to manage the Company s investment grade and non-investment grade corporate bonds, under the Company s direction, in order to maximize investment returns. Such investments are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes gains and losses when these securities have other than temporary impairment, mature or are sold using the specific identification method.   
     
    Deferred Acquisition Costs   Deferred acquisition costs are those incremental direct costs related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal business. These incremental direct costs are those that are essential to the contract transaction and would not have been incurred had the contract transaction not occurred. Such incremental direct costs include commissions, costs of contract issuance and underwriting, state premium taxes and other costs the Company incurs to successfully acquire new business or renew existing business. The Company defers policy acquisition costs and amortizes them over the estimated life of the contracts, which are short-duration in nature, in proportion to premiums earned. The Company capitalized deferred acquisition costs of approximately $753,000 and $760,000 and amortized approximately $1,196,000 and $1,104,000 of these capitalized costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company capitalized deferred acquisition costs of approximately $4,847,000 and $3,698,000 and amortized approximately $3,557,000 and $3,278,000 of these capitalized costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amortization of these costs is recorded in commission expense and other acquisition costs included in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.       
     
    Claims Payable   The Company estimates liabilities for both incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) and reported claims in process by employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries.  These estimates meet actuarial standards of practice and are also recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Management s estimates of dental services provided are based on the Company s historical experience and current trends, with assistance from the Company s consulting actuary. Estimated dental claims payable are reviewed monthly by management and are adjusted based on current information, actual paid claims data, dental utilization statistics and other pertinent information. However, final claim payments may differ from the established reserves. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operations in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.       
     
   New Accounting Guidance  In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance, ASU 2015-09, Financial  Services-Insurance: Disclosures About Short-Duration Contracts.  ASU 2015-09 requires entities to provide additional disclosures about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses to increase the transparency of significant estimates. The guidance also requires entities to disclose information about significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, including reasons for the change and the effects on the financial statements. In addition, this guidance also requires entities to disclose a roll forward of the liability of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense for annual and interim reporting periods. The effective date of this new guidance is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods within the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt the ASU for the 2016 annual reporting period and interim periods in 2017. This ASU will not have a material impact on our Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations, but the ASU will require additional disclosures to our annual and interim financial statements.  

5

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10)   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . ASU 2016-01 revises the accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The effective date of ASU 2016-01 is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The ASU has not yet been adopted by the Company. Management is currently evaluating the impact on our Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations, but it is not expected to have a significant impact.       
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  ASU 2016-02 introduces a new lease model that requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. While this new standard retains most of the principles of the existing lessor model under U.S. GAAP, it aligns many of those principles with ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The effective date of ASU 2016-02 is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The ASU has not yet been adopted by the Company. We expect to identify similar lease obligations under ASU 2016-02. As a result, we expect the timing and amounts of our expense to remain similar.   
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 amends previous guidance on the impairment of financial instruments by adding an impairment model that allows an entity to recognize expected credit losses as an allowance rather than impairing as they are incurred. The new guidance is intended to reduce complexity of credit impairment models and result in a more timely recognition of expected credit losses. The effective date of ASU 2016-13 is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The ASU has not yet been adopted by the Company. Management is currently evaluating the impact on our Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations, but it is not expected to have a significant impact.

   INVESTMENTS      
     
  The Company owned certificates of deposit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) with an amortized cost of $1,090,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The certificates of deposit included in short term and fixed maturities investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The Company also invests in money market funds included in short term investments that are classified as available-for-sale, with a cost of approximately $220,000 and $249,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company invested in corporate bonds with an amortized cost of approximately $7,856,000 and $7,855,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These corporate bonds included in fixed maturity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.  
     
  The Company owned corporate bonds at September 30, 2016, which consisted primarily of investment grade securities. At September 30, 2016, total bond fair value was approximately $8,080,000, which consisted of approximately $7,499,000 with a credit rating of BBB- or better. The remaining securities, totaling approximately $581,000 had a credit rating of BB+ or lower. The weighted average yield-to-cost of the Company s corporate bonds was approximately 3.1% at September 30, 2016. The weighted average maturity of the Company s corporate bonds was 5.07 years at September 30, 2016.   

6

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, maturity dates for fixed maturities and short term investments (excluding the money market funds) were:  

Investments classified at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as fixed maturities and short term investments were as follows:  

Unrealized losses on investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were generally due to higher current market yields relative to the yields of the investments at their amortized cost. Unrealized losses due to credit risk associated with the underlying collateral of the investments, if any, are not material. All investments with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly to determine if any impairment is other than temporary, requiring a charge to earnings. The Company considers the severity of the loss on a security, duration of loss, duration of the investment, credit rating of the security, as well as payment performance and the Company s intent or requirement to sell the investment before recovery when determining whether any impairment is other than temporary. The Company had no investments in a material unrealized loss position for greater than one year at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

   DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN       
     
  In accordance with the 2006 Dental Care Plus Management Equity Incentive Plan and the Dental Care Plus, Inc. and DCP Holding Company Deferred Compensation Plan (the  Plans ), Company directors and certain key employees elected to defer portions of their director fees and employee compensation, as applicable. In 2016, the non-employee members of the Board were granted a total of 228 share based awards. In 2016, key employees were granted 89 share based awards. The Company recorded deferred compensation expense of approximately $125,000 and $46,000 related to deferred share awards and the change in the value of phantom shares for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded deferred compensation expense of approximately $15,000 and $26,000 related to deferred director fees and deferred employee compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded deferred compensation expense of approximately $399,000 and $371,000 related to deferred share awards and the change in the value of phantom shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded deferred compensation expense of approximately $40,000 and $112,000 related to deferred director fees and deferred employee compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Plans also provide for the directors and key employees to receive share awards based on the book value of the Redeemable Common Shares.   
     
   In February 2016 and 2015, the Board declared a per share cash dividend for all Redeemable Common Shares in the amounts of $40.47 and $39.86 per share, respectively. With the dividend, the holders of restricted share units and phantom shares received an equivalent share based dividend that resulted in an increase in the deferred compensation liability of approximately $102,000 and $65,000 in February 2016 and February 2015, respectively.   
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the deferred compensation liability was approximately $3,548,000 and $3,287,000, respectively.   

5.    
 
   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES       
     
  The Company calculates its year to date income tax provision by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate for the year to pretax income. The effective tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 43.3% with tax expense of approximately $502,000 and $1,018,000, respectively. The effective tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 43.3% with tax expense of approximately $274,000 and $483,000, respectively.   Tax years subsequent to 2012 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), and 2011 remains open to state and local tax authorities.  The Company has recorded no uncertain tax positions in the tax years that are subject to examination.

   ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME       
     
  Accumulated other comprehensive income includes changes in unrealized gains and losses on available for sale and other invested assets as follows:

7.    
 
   SEGMENT INFORMATION       
     
  The Company manages its business with four segments: fully-insured dental HMO and indemnity, fully-insured dental PPO, self-insured dental and corporate, all other. Self-insured dental consists of the self-insured dental HMO, self-insured dental PPO and self-insured dental indemnity products. Corporate, all other consists of revenue associated with the Company s dental indemnity and vision products underwritten by third-party insurance carriers and certain other corporate activities. These segments are consistent with information used by the Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) in managing the business.   
     
  The results of the fully-insured dental HMO and indemnity, fully-insured dental PPO and self-insured dental segments are measured by gross profit. The Company does not allocate insurance expense, investment and other income, assets or liabilities to these segments because the Company does not use these measures to analyze the segments. These items are assigned to the remainder of the Company s business, which it identifies as corporate, all other. The Company s gross profit was approximately $6,422,000 and $5,597,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s gross profit was approximately $18,255,000 and $15,599,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
     
  Listed below is financial information required for each reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):

Inter-segment revenues were not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

8.    
 
   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS       
     
  The Company classifies the assets and liabilities that require measurement of fair value based on the priority of the observable and market-based sources of data into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   

Level 1   Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.    

Level 2   Valuations based on significant other observable inputs other than those included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.    

Level 3   Valuations based on unobservable inputs such as when observable inputs are not available or inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.    

11

The following table presents for each of the fair value levels, the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (amounts in thousands):  

(a) Included as a trading security in other assets    

(b) Included in other assets    

(c) Included in other payables and accruals     

The Company measures fair value using the following valuation methodologies. The Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of the deferred compensation investments and certain state fund guarantee deposits; such items are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include government securities and mutual fund equity securities. The Company primarily bases fair value for investments in fixed-maturity securities on quoted market prices or on prices from a pricing vendor, an outside resource that supplies independent securities pricing, dividend, corporate action and descriptive information to support fund pricing, securities operations, research and portfolio management. The Company obtains and reviews the pricing service s valuation methodologies and validates these prices using various inputs including quotes from other independent regulatory sources. When deemed necessary, the Company validates prices by replicating a sample using a discounted cash flow model. Such items are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company obtains a price from an independent vendor to determine the fair value of the interest rate swap. The independent vendor uses a discounted cash flow method whereby the significant observable inputs include the replacement interest rates of similar swap instruments in the market and swap curves; such items are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company has a mortgage note with a bank. The carrying value of the mortgage note of approximately $1,160,000 at September 30, 2016 approximates fair value. The Company did not have any transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

   Overview    
     
  Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Dental Care Plus Group offers to Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana employer groups of all sizes dental HMO, dental PPO, dental indemnity and vision PPO benefit plans and related services. The Company also offers dental PPO plans to individuals and small groups on the Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Tennessee exchanges and individual dental HMO and PPO plans in Ohio and Kentucky. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 380,200 members in our dental and vision benefit programs with approximately 2,900 dentists participating in our dental HMO network, approximately 3,100 dentists participating in our DentaSelect dental PPO network and approximately 2,200 dentists in our Balanced Value dental PPO network. The Company has a network access agreement with a national dental network management company that has one of the largest PPO networks of dentists under contract in the United States. With this network access agreement, our dental PPO members have access to approximately 2,600 additional dentists in Ohio and Indiana and approximately 45,000 additional dentists throughout the United States. The Company also has other network access arrangements for the dental PPO plans that it offers on the Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Tennessee exchanges. With these network access arrangements, our exchange members have access to approximately 6,000 dentists across Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Tennessee.  
     
  We manage our business with four reportable segments: fully-insured dental HMO and indemnity ( dental HMO/IND ), fully-insured dental PPO, self-insured dental, and corporate, all other. Self-insured dental consists of the self-insured dental HMO, self-insured dental PPO and self-insured dental indemnity products. Corporate, all other primarily consists of revenue associated with our dental and vision products underwritten by third-party insurance carriers and certain other corporate activities.   
     
  The results of our fully-insured dental HMO/IND, fully-insured dental PPO and self-insured dental segments are measured by gross profit. We do not measure the gross profit of our corporate, all other segment. We do not allocate investment and other income, insurance expenses, assets or liabilities to our segments because these measures are not used to analyze the segments. Our segments do not share overhead costs or assets. We do, however, measure the contributions of each of our fully-insured and self-insured segments to costs retained in our corporate, all other segment.  
     
   Strategy    
     
  Our strategy focuses on providing solutions to employers and individuals to manage the rising cost of dental care by leveraging our products that give employer groups and members options that meet their needs. We strive to provide excellent customer service to our employer groups, members, brokers and dentists. Additionally, we have increased the diversification of our membership base, not only through our newer products, but also by entering new geographic territories.

On April 16, 2016, our Board of Directors met with our senior management team and advisors to review progress relative to the proposed five-year strategic growth plan for the Company.    This five-year growth plan that includes the expansion by the Company into new states and new metropolitan service areas, was developed by the senior management team with input from the Board of Directors in response to the industry and regulatory changes resulting from  the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its implementation.   
       
   Highlights        

To date in 2016, our dental and vision product membership increased by approximately 18,000 members to approximately 380,200 members at September 30, 2016. This membership increase from December 31, 2015 is due to an increase in fully-insured dental HMO/IND membership of approximately 8,500 members, an increase in fully-insured dental PPO membership of approximately 9,200 members, and an increase in corporate, all other membership of approximately 2,100 members. The increase in corporate, all other membership is primarily due to an increase in our vision PPO membership. These membership increases were offset by a decrease in self-insured membership of approximately 1,800 members.     

Our ratio of healthcare services expense to premium revenue ( loss ratio ) decreased from 78.8% in the 2015 period to 77.0% in the 2016 period. This loss ratio decrease is due primarily to the increase in fully insured exchange dental PPO product membership that has a lower than average loss ratio.      

In March 2016, we paid a dividend of $40.47 per share to shareholders of record for all Redeemable Common Shares. We paid a dividend in March 2015 of $39.86 per share to shareholders of record for all Redeemable Common Shares.     

During the 2016 period, we sold an aggregate of 433 Class B and 1,766 Class C Redeemable Common Shares of approximately $2,280,000. The net proceeds, with available cash, was used to repurchase all outstanding shares of the Company s Redeemable Institutional Preferred Shares.      

Comparison of Results of Operations    
     
  The following is a discussion of our results of operations for the 2016 quarter and the 2015 quarter, the 2016 period and the 2015 period.  
     
  The table below presents membership and financial data for our four reportable segments (dollar amounts in thousands):

Membership    
     
  Our fully-insured dental HMO/IND membership increased by approximately 8,800 members as of September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015. The increase in fully-insured dental HMO/IND membership is the result of new sales of 13,100, offset by the loss of approximately 4,300 members due to employer groups that did not renew with the Company or reduced employee counts of retained employer groups. Some of our fully-insured dental HMO membership losses were the result of employer groups moving to medical carriers to take advantage of medical/dental packaged savings.  
     
  Our fully insured dental PPO membership increased by approximately 11,200 members as of September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015. The increase in fully-insured dental PPO membership is primarily the result of new sales of approximately 18,600 members, offset by the loss of approximately 7,400 members due to employer groups that did not renew with the Company or reduced employee counts of retained employer groups. Some of our fully-insured dental PPO membership losses were the result of employer groups moving to medical carriers to take advantage of medical/dental packaged savings.  
     
  Our self-insured dental membership decreased by approximately 1,800 members as of September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction within existing employer groups.  
     
  Our corporate, all other membership increased by approximately 4,500 members as of September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of our vision plan membership.

An increase in fully-insured dental HMO/IND membership resulted in an increase in fully-insured dental HMO/IND healthcare services expense of $494,000. In addition, an increase of $49,000 is attributable to fee schedule increases effective January 1, 2016.

The change in cash for the 2016 and 2015 period is summarized as follows (in thousands):  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities    
     
  In the 2016 period, approximately $1,782,000 was provided by operating activities. We had net income of approximately $1,331,000. Our non-cash deferred compensation activity was approximately $434,000 primarily due to current year vesting activity and an increase in current book value in the 2016 period. Deferred policy acquisition costs increased by approximately $1,290,000 primarily as a result of the increase in the fully-insured business renewed in January 2016. Other assets increased by approximately $209,000 primarily due to the increase in the prepaid expense, which is the result of the federal premium tax increase on a graduated year-over-year percentage increase of premium revenue earned as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Other payables and accrued expenses increased and resulted in a net increase in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1,285,000. An increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase in unearned premium revenue resulted in a decrease of cash of approximately $134,000 in the 2016 period. We paid $855,000 of federal income taxes in the 2016 period that related to our 2015 extension payment and 2016 estimated tax payments. The remaining effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities that represent fluctuations are not significant and are consistent with the 2015 period.   
     
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities

  In the 2016 period, we made scheduled principal payments of approximately $38,000 related to our office building mortgage and scheduled payments of approximately $232,000 related to our capital leases. During the 2016 period, we repurchased Redeemable Common Shares with a value of approximately $184,000.

    Refer to the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for a description of contractual obligations, other commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements. We have had no significant changes in these items in 2016.  
     
   Financial Condition    
     
  Our consolidated cash and short term investments were approximately $10.5 million and $12.1 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations during the balance of 2016. Based on total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we estimate that we had approximately 37 days of cash and short term investments on hand at September 30, 2016. In addition, the Company has access to approximately $8.9 million of fixed maturity investments that are classified as available-for-sale and two working capital lines of credit discussed below.   
     
  In December 2012, the Company refinanced the mortgage of its office building and in connection therewith, the Company executed a mortgage note with a bank, secured by the land and the office building, in the amount of $1,340,000. Interest is payable based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 1.95%. The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively changed the interest rate related to the mortgage note with a commercial bank from a variable rate based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 1.95% to a fixed rate of 3.90% for the 10-year period through December 22, 2022.        
     
  We have an annually renewable agreement with a commercial bank for a $500,000 working capital line of credit. Interest is payable at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. We did not have any interest expense for the line of credit in the 2016 period or the 2015 period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no amount outstanding on this line of credit. The $500,000 working capital line of credit expires in July 2017. We expect to renew this line of credit at its maturity.   
     
  We have an additional annually renewable working capital line of credit for $1,000,000. Interest is payable at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. We did not have any interest expense for the line of credit in the 2016 period or the 2015 period. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no amount outstanding on this line of credit. The $1,000,000 working capital line of credit expires in July 2017. We expect to renew this line of credit at its maturity.  
     
  Under the mortgage note and each of the renewable lines of credit, the Company is required to have a debt service ratio of at least 1:1 at the end of each quarter and a minimum tangible net worth equal to or greater than $3,500,000 at the end of each fiscal year. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  We believe our premium revenues, cash, investments and working capital lines of credit are sufficient to meet our short term and long term liquidity needs. In the short term, we are obligated to make payments related to our contractual obligations such as our healthcare services expense, building mortgage, and our capital and operating leases and other commitments, including payment of certain director s deferred compensation obligations. In the long term, we will continue to be obligated to make payments related to our other contractual obligations. We will also be obligated in certain circumstances to repurchase the Redeemable Common Shares and make future payments to key employees and directors related to their deferred compensation obligations. Our Board of Directors establishes limitations on the amount of share redemptions each year. While we are not able to estimate future redemptions of our Redeemable Common Shares, we believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements and capital expenditures in the next twelve months.  
     
  Our largest subsidiary, Dental Care Plus Inc., ( DCP ), operates in states that regulate its payment of dividends and debt service on inter-company loans, as well as other inter-company cash transfers and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid by DCP, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. Even if prior approval is not required, prior notification must be provided to state insurance departments before paying a dividend. During 2016, the total dividend that the DCP subsidiary may declare without prior regulatory approval is approximately $710,000. There were no dividends declared or paid by DCP in 2016 or 2015.

A.M. Best Company assigns a rating to companies based on their ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders, but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions. In July 2016, A.M. Best Company affirmed our financial strength rating at B+ (Good) with a stable outlook based on DCP s positive operating performance and improved capitalization. Our A.M. Best rating is a measure of our financial strength relative to other insurance companies and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The rating assigned by A.M. Best Company is based, in part, on the ratio of our fully-insured premium revenue to our statutory capital and surplus.  
     
  We attempt to reduce overall risk by maintaining a well-diversified fixed-maturity portfolio of investments. We invest in certificates of deposits, investment grade corporate bonds, non-investment grade corporate bonds, and money market funds, targeting what we believe to be optimal risk-adjusted after-tax yields. Risk, in this context, includes interest rate, call, reinvestment rate, credit and liquidity risk. We typically do not make a concerted effort to alter duration on a portfolio basis in response to anticipated movements in interest rates. By continually investing in certificates of deposits, money market funds and investment and non-investment grade corporate bonds, we believe the portfolio mitigates the impact of adverse economic factors.   
     
  Our regulated subsidiary s state of domicile has statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies largely based on the NAIC s RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company s business. In general, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our subsidiary s risk-based capital as of December 31, 2015, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, was in excess of all mandatory RBC thresholds.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies    

Liability for Claims Payable    
     
  We estimate liabilities for both incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) and reported claims in process by employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice. These actuarial standards of practice require that claim liability estimates be adequate under moderately adverse circumstances. The Company s consulting actuary assists us in making these estimates. Since our liability for claims payable is based on actuarial estimates, the amount of claims eventually paid for services provided prior to the balance sheet date could differ from the estimated liability. Any such differences are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the period in which the differences are identified. Historically, such differences have not been material.   
     
  We develop our estimate for claims payable liability using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based on historical claim payments and claim receipt patterns, as well as historical dental cost trends. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent month, we calculate a  completion factor  which indicates the percentage of claims payable estimated for a prior period that have been paid as of the end of the current reporting period. We use the completion factor to determine historical patterns over a rolling 12-month period, made consistent by making adjustments for known changes in claims in process levels and known changes in claim payment processes. For the most recent month, we calculate a  claims trend factor  that estimates incurred claims primarily from a trend analysis based upon PMPM claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, seasonality and consideration of any subsequent actual claims data available. When developing our estimate for claims payable liability as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we considered actual paid claim data from October 2016 and January 2016. As a result, we were able to use the completion factors approach for all historical months at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  We have not changed the key actuarial methodologies used by management to estimate the IBNR and reported claims in process components of our claims payable liability during the periods presented, and management has not adjusted any of the key methodologies used in calculating the most recent estimate of the IBNR and reported claims in process components of our claims payable liability.   

20

The table below illustrates how our operating results are affected when there is a variance between estimated claims expense and actual claims expense. The table shows the sensitivity of the estimated fully-insured incurred claims payable liability to fluctuations in the expected completion factors that were used to estimate the claims payable liability as of September 30, 2016 within variance ranges historically experienced.  

(a)     Reflects estimated potential changes in incurred claims payable liability caused by changes in completion factors for months prior to the most recent month.  
     
  Based on historical experience, we believe the completion factors we use to estimate outstanding IBNR and reported claims in process are reliable for predicting actual claims paid at future times, with a variance range of approximately one-half of one percent, plus or minus.   
     
    Based on our healthcare services expense on a PMPM basis that adjusts the quarterly healthcare services expense for membership volume changes, we have observed that the utilization of our dental plan members is somewhat variable. In general, claims on a PMPM basis are lower in the second and fourth quarter than in the first quarter and the third quarter. The higher third quarter claim level on a PMPM basis is primarily due to the high level of dental services used in July and August by student members prior to returning to school. Use of dental services is lowest in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season and the fact that a portion of our members have already reached their maximum annual benefit level for the year. The following shows these trends in tabular form:  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
       
  Market risk is the risk that we will incur investment losses or increased interest expense due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures are substantially related to our investment portfolio and the impact of interest rate changes on these securities. In addition, interest rate changes can affect future interest expense for debt obligations that have a variable rate of interest associated with them.  
     
  Our portfolio includes approximately $8,080,000 and $7,822,000 of corporate bonds, approximately $220,000 and $249,000 of money market funds and approximately $1,101,000 and $1,087,000 of investments in FDIC-insured bank certificates of deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We have instructed our investment manager to invest additional funds in shorter duration investment grade corporate bonds with maturities up to five years.   

21

There is increased interest rate risk associated with our investment in longer duration investment grade and non-investment grade corporate bonds. We have evaluated the impact on the invested portfolio s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $277,000 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $261,000 increase in fair value. The investment and non-investment grade corporate bonds as well as the certificates of deposits are all classified as available-for-sale.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a mortgage note with a bank with an outstanding principal balance of $1,161,000 and $1,198,000, respectively, with a variable rate based on LIBOR plus 1.95%. In December 2012, we entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap contract that effectively eliminated the interest rate risk exposure on the entire outstanding loan principal. Management estimates that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not materially impact our annual pre-tax earnings.   

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the design and effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. Based on the evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.   
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f)) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
