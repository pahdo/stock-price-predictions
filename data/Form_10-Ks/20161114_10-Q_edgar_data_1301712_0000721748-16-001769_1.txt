  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements  

1. Description of Business  

Ironclad Performance Wear Corporation ( Ironclad ,
the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated in Nevada on May 26, 2004
and engages in the business of design and manufacture of branded performance work wear including task-specific gloves and performance
apparel designed to significantly improve the wearer s ability to safely, efficiently and comfortably perform general to
highly specific job functions. Its customers are primarily industrial distributors, hardware, lumber and automotive retailers,
 Big Box  home centers and sporting goods retailers. The Company has received nine U.S. patents, 11 international
patents and five U.S. patents and nine foreign patents pending for design and technological innovations incorporated in its performance
work gloves. The Company has 51 registered U.S. trademarks, 6 in-use U.S. trademarks, 17 U.S. trademark pending registration,
34 registered international trademarks, 44 international trademarks pending and 7 copyright marks. 

2. Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) including those for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q
and Article 8 of Regulation S-X issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and note disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected
in these interim financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
March 23, 2016. 

Basis of Consolidation  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Ironclad Performance Corporation, an inactive parent company, and its wholly owned subsidiary Ironclad
California. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements requires
management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions
made by management are used for, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, allowance for
returns and the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high
credit quality institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Company ( FDIC ) insures cash amounts at each institution
for up to $250,000 and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ( SIPC ) also insures cash amounts at each institution
up to $250,000.  The Company maintains cash in excess of the FDIC and SIPC limits. 

Accounts
Receivable   

Table Of Contents        4        

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based
on management s regular evaluation of individual customer s receivables and consideration of a customer s financial
condition and credit history. Trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously
written off are recorded when received. Interest is not charged on past due accounts. 

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our current customers consist of large national, regional
and smaller independent customers with good payment histories with us. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers
and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on management s evaluation of historical experience and current
industry trends. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability
to make payments, additional allowances may be required. New customers are evaluated by us for credit worthiness before terms
are established. Although we expect to collect all amounts due, actual collections may differ. In the third quarter of 2016 we
increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $489,000 to provide for the estimate of uncollectible 2015 receivables net of
inventories expected to be returned from our former Canadian distributor. This return was accepted in order to allow us to refocus
and rebuild our Canadian distribution network to enable us to service our major customers in Canada and due to the distributor s
inability to meet its financial obligations to us. 

Inventory  

Inventory is stated at the lower of average
cost (which approximates first in, first out) or market and consists primarily of finished goods. The Company regularly reviews
its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on management s
estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. 

We review the inventory level of all
products quarterly. For most glove products that have been in the market for one year or greater, we consider inventory levels
of greater than one year s sales to be excess. Due to limited market penetration for our apparel products we have decided
to provide a 50% allowance against this line of products. Products that are no longer part of the current product offering are
considered obsolete. The potential for re-sale of slow-moving and obsolete inventories is based upon our assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. The recorded cost of obsolete inventories is then reduced to zero and a reserve is established for
slow moving products. Both the write down and reserve adjustments are recorded as charges to cost of goods sold. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 we decreased our inventory reserve by $300,251 and $0 with the corresponding
adjustments in cost of goods sold, respectively, and reported an obsolescence reserve balance of $247,549 as of September 30,
2016 and $547,800 as of December 31, 2015. All adjustments for obsolete inventory establish a new cost basis for that inventory
as we believe such reductions are permanent declines in the market price of our products. Generally, obsolete inventory is sold
to companies that specialize in the liquidation of these items or contributed to charities, while we continue to market slow-moving
inventories until they are sold or become obsolete. As obsolete or slow-moving inventory is sold or disposed of, we reduce the
reserve. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are recorded at cost
less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over fifteen years or the lease
term, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 

Trademarks  

The costs incurred to acquire trademarks,
which are active and relate to products with a definite life cycle, are amortized over the estimated useful life of fifteen years.
Trademarks, which are active and relate to corporate identification, such as logos, are not amortized. Pending trademarks are
capitalized and reviewed monthly for active status. 

Long-Lived Asset Impairment  

The Company periodically evaluates whether
events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision
or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that the asset should be evaluated for possible impairment,
the Company uses an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the
asset is recoverable. Based upon the anticipated future income and cash flow from operations and other factors, relevant in the
opinion of the Company s management, there has been no impairment. The Company retired $575,368 of fully depreciated fixed
assets during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.

Revenue Recognition  

A customer is obligated to pay for products
sold to it within a specified number of days from the date that title to the products is transferred to the customer. The Company s
standard terms are typically net 30 days from the transfer of title to the products to the customer, however we have negotiated
special terms with certain customers and industries. The Company typically collects payment from a customer within 30 to 60 days
from the transfer of title to the products to a customer. Transfer of title occurs and risk of ownership generally passes to a
customer at the time of shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the agreement with a particular customer. The sale price
of the Company s products is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale based on purchase orders generated
by a customer and accepted by the Company. A customer s obligation to pay the Company for products sold to it is not contingent
upon the resale of those products. The Company recognizes revenues when products are delivered, or shipped to customers, based
on terms of agreement with the customers and collection is reasonably assured. All transactions are conducted in United States
Dollars and therefore there are no transaction gains or losses incurred on transactions with foreign customers. 

In June 2016, the Company entered into a barter
agreement whereby it delivered $307,837 of its inventory in exchange for future advertising credits and other items. The credits,
which expire in June 2019, are valued at the lower of the Company s cost or market value of the inventory transferred. The
Company has recorded barter credits of $307,837 in   Other Assets - Non-current   at September 30, 2016.
Under the terms of the barter agreement, the Company is required to pay cash equal to a negotiated amount of the bartered advertising,
or other items, and use the barter credits to pay the balance. These credits are charged to expense as they are used. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 $0 was charged to expense for barter credits used. 

In Q2 and Q3 2016, the Company entered into
patent licensing agreements with multiple companies. The licenses are for a fixed fee and are non-cancellable by the licensee.
The Company has no significant continuing obligation with regards to the use of the patent and the license arrangements are treated
as an outright sale. The total value of these agreements was $365,000. The payment terms for these licenses varied by licensee
and, in one case, payments extend over a period of five years. The Company has recorded $41,980 in   Prepaid expenses
and other current assets   at September 30, 2016, representing the amounts that are due and payable within twelve
months of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016,   Other Assets - Non-current   includes $106,925
of amounts that are due and payable in periods after September 30, 2017.  

Revenue Disclosures  

The Company s revenues are derived substantially
from the sale of our core line of task specific work gloves, available to all of our customers, both domestically and internationally.  Below
is a table outlining this breakdown for the comparative periods: 

Table Of Contents        6        

Cost of Goods Sold  

Our cost of goods sold includes the Free on
Board cost of the product plus landed costs. Landed costs include freight-in, insurance, duties and administrative costs to deliver
the finished goods to our distribution warehouse. Cost of goods sold does not include purchasing costs, warehousing or distribution
costs. These costs are captured as incurred on a separate line in operating expenses. Our gross profit may not be comparable to
other entities that may include some or all of these costs in the calculation of gross profit. 

Product Returns, Allowances and Adjustments  

Product returns, allowances and adjustments
is a broad term that encompasses a number of offsets to gross sales. Included herein are warranty returns of defective products,
returns of saleable products and sales adjustments. 

Warranty Returns    We have a
warranty policy that covers defects in workmanship. It allows customers to return damaged or defective products to us following
a customary return merchandise authorization process for a period of one year from the date of purchase. 

Saleable Product Returns  - We may allow
from time to time, depending on the customer and existing circumstances, stock adjustment returns, whereby the customer is given
the opportunity to  trade out  of a style of product that does not sell well in their territory, usually in exchange
for another product, again following the customary return merchandise authorization process. In addition we may allow from time
to time other saleable product returns from customers for other business reasons, for example, in settlement of an outstanding
accounts receivable, from a discontinued distributor customer or other customer service purpose. 

Sales Adjustments  - These adjustments
include pricing and shipping corrections and periodic adjustments to the product returns reserve. 

For both warranty and saleable product
returns we utilize actual historical return rates to determine our allowance for returns in each period, adjusted for unique,
one-time events. Gross sales are reduced by estimated returns. We record a corresponding accrual for the estimated liability associated
with the estimated returns which is based on the historical gross sales of the products corresponding to the estimated returns.
This accrual is offset each period by actual product returns. 

Our current estimated future sales return
rate is approximately 1.0% of the trailing twelve months  net sales. As noted above, our return rate is based upon our past
history of actual returns and we estimate amounts for product returns for a given period by applying this historical return rate
and reducing actual gross sales for that period by a corresponding amount. We believe that using a trailing 12-month return rate
provides us with a sufficient period of time to establish recent historical trends in product returns for two primary reasons:
(i) our products  useful life is approximately 3-4 months and (ii) we are able to quickly correct any significant quality
issues as we learn about them. If an unusual circumstance exists, such as a product that has begun to show materially different
actual return rates as compared to our average 12-month return rates, we will make appropriate adjustments to our estimated return
rates. Factors that could cause materially different actual return rates as compared to the 12-month return rates include a new
product line, a change in materials or product being supplied by a new factory. Although we have no specific statistical data
on this matter, we believe that our practices are reasonable and consistent with those of our industry. Our warranty terms under
our arrangements with our suppliers do not provide for individual products returned by retailers or retail customers to be returned
to the vendor. 

Table Of Contents        7        

Advertising and Marketing  

Advertising and marketing costs are expensed
as incurred. Advertising expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $150,629 and $68,961 and
$335,848 and $238,674, respectively. 

Shipping and Handling Costs  

Freight billed to customers is recorded as
sales revenue and the related freight costs as cost of sales. 

Customer Concentrations  

Two customers accounted for approximately
$2,129,000 or 33.0% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   One customer accounted for approximately
$1,328,000 or 24.5% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Two customers accounted for approximately
$5,782,000 or 34.2% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   Three customers accounted for approximately
$6,807,000 or 44.9% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. No other customers accounted for more than 10%
of net sales during the periods.   

Supplier Concentrations  

Two suppliers, who are located overseas, accounted
for approximately 38% of total purchases for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Three suppliers, who are located
overseas, accounted for approximately 61% of total purchases for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Three suppliers,
who are located overseas, accounted for approximately 50% of total purchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
Two suppliers, who are located overseas, accounted for approximately 51% of total purchases for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. All transactions are conducted in United States Dollars and therefore there are no transaction gains or losses incurred
on transactions with foreign suppliers. 

Table Of Contents        8        

Stock Based Compensation  

The Company follows the provisions of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718,   Share-Based
Payment.    This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges
its equity instruments for goods or services, as well as transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods
or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of
those equity instruments.  ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized
in the financial statements based on the fair value of the share-based payment.  ASC 718 establishes fair value as the
measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees, such as the options issued under our
stock incentive plans. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share  

The Company utilizes FASB ASC 260,   Earnings
per Share .  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings
(loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Common equivalent
shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

As a result of the net loss for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company calculated diluted earnings per share using weighted average basic shares outstanding
only, as using diluted shares would be anti-dilutive to loss per share. 

The following table sets forth the calculation
of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 if diluted shares were to be included: 

The following potential common shares have
been excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods presented as the effect would have been
anti-dilutive: 

Table Of Contents        9        

Income Taxes  

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB
ASC 740-10 effective January 1, 2007. The implementation of FASB ASC 740-10 has not caused the Company to recognize any changes
in its identified tax positions. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as additional
income taxes in the statement of operations. 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects
of the transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily
to the difference between the basis of the allowance for doubtful accounts, accumulated depreciation and amortization, accrued
payroll and net operating loss carryforwards for financial and income tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent
the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities
are recovered or settled. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected
at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.
As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income
taxes. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance
is recognized. 

The components of the provision for
income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was deferred income tax expense of $1,832,000 and $0, respectively. 
As of September 30, 2016, we reviewed current profitability and forecasted future results and concluded that it is more likely
than not that we will not be able to realize any of our deferred tax assets. In recognition of this risk, we increased our valuation
allowance by $1,832,000 on the deferred taxes for the period ended September 30, 2016. We will continue to evaluate if it is more
likely than not that we will realize the future benefits from current and future deferred tax assets. These deferred tax benefits
are recorded on the balance sheet as long term deferred tax assets of $0 and $1,832,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The fair value of the Company s financial
instruments is determined by using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The Company s principal
financial instruments are cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term line of credit debt. At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term line of credit debt, due to their short maturities,
and liquidity, are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate fair value. 

The Company measures the fair value of its
financial instruments using the procedures set forth below for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value that were previously
carried at fair value pursuant to other accounting guidelines. 

Under FASB ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements  
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. 

FASB ASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy
for disclosure to show the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value measurements. 

Level 1    Uses unadjusted
quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. 

Level 2    Uses inputs,
other than Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market
data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active.
Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant
judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily
observable data. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, including interest rate swaps. 

Level 3    Uses inputs
that are unobservable and are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market
participant assumptions. 

There were no items measured at fair value
on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-10, an amendment to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 provides a comprehensive
new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer
at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and expands related
disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-10 clarifies ASU 2014-09 to address the potential for diversity in practice at the adoption. ASU
2016-10 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early application is
permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements as well
as the expected adoption method. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ).
ASU 2014-15 require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding
upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of
the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles
for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated
as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial
doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are
issued (or available to be issued).   The new standard applies prospectively to annual periods
ending after December 15, 2016, and to annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact this ASU will have on our financial position and results of operations. 

On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-11, which requires entities to measure most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable value,  thereby
simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context
is defined as one of three different measures). The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM).   For public business entities,
the ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early application
of the ASU is permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the accounting change. We are currently
evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial position and results of operations. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments under the new guidance require
that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The guidance
is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively
to all periods presented. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. Accordingly, we
have reclassified $404,000 of deferred tax assets previously classified as current as of December 31, 2015 to non-current. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). This guidance will change how companies account
for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Companies will be required to recognize the difference between
the estimated and the actual tax impact of awards within the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, and additional
paid-in capital ( APIC ) pools will be eliminated. This ASU also impacts the classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities and the classification of share-based transactions within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

7. Bank Lines of Credit  

Bank Revolving Loan  

On November 28, 2014 we entered into a Revolving
Loan and Security Agreement with Capital One, N.A. which currently provides a revolving loan of up to $8,000,000. The loan was
due to expire on November 30, 2016. On September 16, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we increased the line limit
from $6,000,000 to $8,000,000. All advances, up to the line limit of $8,000,000, are subject to a Borrowing Base report. The term
Borrowing Base means an amount equal to (a) 80% of the net amount of all eligible accounts receivable plus, (b) 50% of the value
of eligible landed inventory, plus (c) 35% of eligible in-transit inventory. In addition, the outstanding principal amount of
all advances against eligible inventory shall not exceed 50% of the total line limit. All of our assets secure amounts borrowed
under the terms of this agreement. Interest on borrowed funds accrued at LIBOR plus 2.80% until such time as the Company s
trailing twelve month EBITDAS (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Stock compensation expense) exceeded
$1,000,000 at which time the rate decreased to LIBOR plus 2.50%. The interest rate at September 30, 2016 was 3.023%. This agreement
contains a Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio covenant and a Tangible Net Worth covenant. On March 16, 2016, the Company modified
its Revolving Loan and Security Agreement with Capital One, N.A. which allowed the Company to add certain legal expenses of up
to $325,000 in the calculation of EBITDAS for the trailing twelve month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December

Warrant Activity  

A summary of warrant activity is as follows :  

Stock Based Compensation  

Ironclad California reserved 3,020,187 shares
of its common stock for issuance to employees, directors and consultants under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, which the Company
assumed in the merger (the  2000 Plan ). Under the 2000 Plan, options may be granted at prices not less than the fair
market value of the Company s common stock at the grant date. Options generally have a ten-year term and shall be exercisable
as determined by the Board of Directors. 

Effective May 18, 2006, the Company reserved
4,250,000 shares of its common stock for issuance to employees, directors and consultants under its 2006 Stock Incentive Plan
(the  2006 Plan ). In September, 2009, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of shares
of common stock reserved under the 2006 Plan to 11,000,000 shares.  In April, 2011, the shareholders of the Company
approved a further increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved under the 2006 Plan to 13,000,000 shares. In May,
2013, the shareholders of the Company approved a further increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved under the 2006
Plan to 16,000,000 shares. In April, 2014, the shareholders of the Company approved a further increase in the number of shares
of common stock reserved under the 2006 Plan to 21,000,000 shares. Under the 2006 Plan, options may be granted at prices not less
than the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the grant date. Options generally have a ten-year term and shall
be exercisable as determined by the Board of Directors. 

The fair value of each stock option granted
under either the 2000 Plan or 2006 Plan is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes Model.  The Black-Scholes
Model has assumptions for risk free interest rates, dividends, stock volatility and expected life of an option grant. The risk
free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Bill rate with a maturity based on the expected life of the options and on the
closest day to an individual stock option grant. Dividend rates are based on the Company s dividend history. The stock volatility
factor is based on historical market prices of the Company s common stock. The expected life of an option grant is based
on management s estimate. The fair value of each option grant is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period
of the option on a straight line basis. 

For stock options issued during the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of these options was estimated at the date of the grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following range of assumptions: 

A summary of stock option activity is as follows: 

The following table summarizes information
about stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016: 

The following tabl e
summarizes information about stock options exercisable at September 30, 2016:  

The
following table summarizes information about non-vested stock options at September 30, 2016:  

From time to time, we issue awards
of restricted common stock to our board members. Generally, the awards vest over a period of one year after the date of grant
contingent upon the continued service of the recipients. Awards are valued based on the market value of the common stock at grant
date and compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period. The Company granted 500,000 restricted common stock awards
in 2016 and 733,333 restricted stock awards in 2015. 

The following tables summarize information about  non-vested
stock awards:  

In accordance with ASC 718, the Company recorded $94,009
and $90,487 of compensation expense for employee stock options during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The
Company recorded $285,610 and $265,202 of compensation expense for employee stock options during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. There was a total of $567,247 of unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested share-based compensation
arrangements under the Plan outstanding at September 30, 2016. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 2.19 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $254,251.  

9. Income Taxes   

The Company adopted FASB ASC 740-10,   Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109   as of January 1, 2007. FASB ASC 740-10
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial
statement disclosure of tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FASB ASC 740-10 provides guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. No adjustments
were required upon adoption of FASB ASC 740-10.  

The Company is currently open to audit under the statute
of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the fiscal years 2013 through 2015. The Company s state tax returns are
open to audit under the statute of limitations for the fiscal years 2011 through 2015.  

The provision
for income taxes differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory rate for the periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 as follows:    

In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. The Company s glove business generally shows an increase in sales during the third and fourth quarters
due primarily to an increase in the sale of the winter glove line during this period. The Company typically generates 55% - 65%
of the glove net sales during these months. The change in valuation allowance is affected by the seasonality of the business.
As of September 30, 2016, we reviewed current profitability and forecasted future results and concluded that it is more likely
than not that we will not be able to realize any of our deferred tax assets. In recognition of this risk, we have increased the
valuation allowance by $1,832,000 on the deferred taxes for the period ended September 30, 2016.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had unused federal
and states net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of approximately $4,104,000 and $5,384,000,
respectively, that expire between 2016 and 2027.  

10. Commitments and Contingencies   

The Company entered into a five-year lease with one option
to renew for an additional five years for a corporate office and warehouse lease commencing in July 2006. The Company exercised
its five year option to renew this lease commencing in July 2011. The facility is located in El Segundo, California. As part of
this renewal process we reduced our square footage by approximately 1,700 square feet of unneeded warehouse space in exchange
for six months of rent concessions and approximately $40,000 for tenant improvements. The Company has sublet this facility for
the remainder of its lease term as the Company relocated to Texas. Accordingly, rent expense for this facility for the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0 and $0, respectively. Rent expense for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 was $2,032 and $4,063, respectively.  

On June 11, 2014, the Company entered into a 42 month
lease for a new corporate office facility in Farmers Branch, Texas, commencing in the third quarter of 2014. The Company relocated
its corporate headquarters to Texas in the third quarter of 2014. This new facility is approximately 13,026 square feet and the
Company has negotiated six months of rent abatement. The monthly base rent is $7,653 plus $3,449 for common area operating expenses.
A security deposit of one month s rent has been made in the amount of $11,102. As part of this process, we were granted
$60,000 for tenant improvements. Rent expense attributable to this facility for the three months and nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $27,468 and $81,778, respectively. Rent expense for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was
$24,263 and $72,788, respectively.  

On November 10, 2015, the Company entered into a 24 month
lease for a new international sourcing office in Jakarta, Indonesia, commencing on January 1, 2016. The monthly base rent is approximately
$1,200 during the first year of the lease with an increase to approximately $1,325 per month for the second year of the lease.
A security deposit of three month s rent has been made in the amount of $3,730. Rent expense attributable to this facility
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,343 and $13,346, respectively. No rent expense was recognized
during 2015.  

The Company has various non-cancelable operating leases
for office equipment expiring through October, 2019. Equipment lease expense charged to operations under these leases was $3,863
and $3,626 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Equipment lease expense charged to operations
under these leases was $15,895 and $11,468 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Future minimum rental commitments under these non-cancelable
operating leases for years ending December 31 are as follows:  

11. Legal Proceedings   

On September 28, 2015 Ironclad Performance Wear Corporation
filed a Petition in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, 193rd Judicial District, Cause No. DC-15-11878, against Orr Safety
Corporation ( Orr ), a significant customer of the Company.  The Petition alleged that Orr had materially breached
an Exclusive License and Distributorship Agreement with Ironclad by, inter alia, failing to use its best efforts to actively promote,
market and sell the KONG  brand of gloves manufactured by Ironclad, and selling gloves that were similar to, or competitive
with, the KONG  brand.  The Petition also alleged that Orr materially breached other agreements between the parties,
and provided notice that Ironclad was terminating the Exclusive License and Distributorship Agreement due to Orr s material
breaches.  The Petition sought damages, declaratory relief regarding Ironclad s rights and obligations under the relevant
agreements, and all other available relief.  On October 23, 2015, Orr filed an Answer and Counterclaim in the Dallas County
action, and concurrently removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Case No. 3:15-cv-03453-D.
 Orr s Counterclaim alleged that Ironclad breached the Exclusive License and Distributorship Agreement, as well as
a Sub-Distributorship Agreement between the parties by, inter alia, infringing upon Orr s exclusive rights under the agreements,
failing to pay appropriate royalties to Orr, and failing to protect the intellectual property of the KONG  brand of glove. 
The Counterclaim also alleged that Ironclad engaged in selling  counterfeit  KONG  products in violation of the
parties  agreement.  Ironclad filed an Answer to the Counterclaim on November 27, 2015 denying all material allegations. 
On December 7, 2015, Orr filed an Amended Answer to Ironclad s Petition responding to each of the allegations pursuant to
the pleading standards in federal court.  On December 3, 2015, the Court entered a Scheduling Order setting deadlines for
discovery and dispositive motions.  On July 13, 2016, the Company filed a motion for summary judgement.   

On August 26, 2016, the Company executed a
settlement agreement to settle the lawsuit. The terms of this agreement are confidential. Orr will continue to be an
important distributor of the Company s products, but the Company can also sell KONG  through other distribution channels.  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

This discussion summarizes the significant factors
affecting our operating results, financial condition and liquidity and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with
the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. Except for
historical information, the matters discussed in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various
factors that are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in any forward-looking
statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016.   

Overview   

We are a leading designer and manufacturer of branded
performance work wear. Founded in 1998, we have grown and leveraged our proprietary technologies to produce task-specific gloves
and performance apparel that are designed to significantly improve the wearer s ability to safely, efficiently and comfortably
perform general to highly specific job functions. We have built and continue to augment our reputation among professionals in
the construction and industrial service markets, and do-it-yourself and sporting goods consumers with products specifically designed
for individual tasks or task types. We believe that our dedication to quality and durability and focus on our client needs has
created a high level of brand loyalty and has solidified substantial brand equity.  

We plan to increase our domestic revenues by leveraging
our relationships with existing retailers and industrial distributors, including  Big Box,  automotive and sporting
goods retailers, increasing our product offerings in new and existing locations, and introducing new products, developed and targeted
for specific customers and/or industries.  

We believe that our products have international appeal.
In 2005, we began selling products in Australia and Japan through independent distributors, which accounted for approximately
10% of total sales for the quarter presented. From 2006 through 2015 we entered the Canadian and European markets through distributors.
International sales represented approximately 30% of total sales in fiscal year 2015. We plan to continue to increase sales internationally
by expanding our distribution into Europe and other international markets during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  

General   

Net sales are comprised of gross sales less returns and
discounts. Our operating results are seasonal, with a greater percentage of net sales being earned in the third and fourth quarters
of our fiscal year due to the fall and winter selling seasons.  

Our cost of goods sold includes the FOB cost of the product
plus landed costs and a reserve for slow-moving inventory. Landed costs include freight-in, insurance, duties and administrative
costs to deliver the finished goods to our distribution warehouse. Cost of goods sold does not include purchasing, warehousing
or distribution costs. These costs are captured as incurred on a separate line in operating expenses. Our gross margins may not
be comparable to other entities that may include some or all of these costs in the calculation of gross margin.  

Our operating expenses consist primarily of payroll and
related costs, marketing costs, corporate infrastructure costs and our purchasing, warehousing and distribution costs.  

Historically, we have funded our working capital needs
through a combination of our existing asset-based credit facility along with subordinated debt and equity financing transactions.  

On November 28, 2014 we entered into a Revolving Loan
and Security Agreement with Capital One, N.A. which currently provides a revolving loan of up to $8,000,000. The loan was due
to expire on November 30, 2016. On September 16, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we increased the line limit from
$6,000,000 to $8,000,000. All advances, up to the line limit of $8,000,000, are subject to a Borrowing Base report. The term Borrowing
Base means an amount equal to (a) 80% of the net amount of all eligible accounts receivable plus, (b) 50% of the value of eligible
landed inventory, plus (c) 35% of eligible in-transit inventory. In addition, the outstanding principal amount of all advances
against eligible inventory shall not exceed 50% of the total line limit. All of our assets secure amounts borrowed under the terms
of this agreement. Interest on borrowed funds accrued at LIBOR plus 2.80% until such time as the Company s trailing twelve
month EBITDAS (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Stock compensation expense) exceeded $1,000,000
at which time the rate decreased to LIBOR plus 2.50%. The interest rate at September 30, 2016 was 3.023%. This agreement contains
a Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio covenant and a Tangible Net Worth covenant. On March 16, 2016, the Company modified its
Revolving Loan and Security Agreement with Capital One, N.A. which allowed the Company to add certain legal expenses of up to
$325,000 in the calculation of EBITDAS for the trailing twelve month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December
31, 2016 and permit including certain receivables of up to $300,000 in the definition of eligible accounts receivable in determining
the Borrowing Base.  

On November 7, 2016, Capital One, N.A. granted the Company
a 90-day extension of the maturity date from November 30, 2016 to February 28, 2017. Capital One, N.A. has also stated that additional
extensions and/or renewals will be considered, as necessary. During this extension, the Company s intent is to renew the
line with Capital One, N.A. and has already commenced talks with them to begin the process. We cannot assure that we would be
able to successfully renew or replace the line of credit described above that would allow us to meet our debt obligations.  

On November 7, 2016 and August 9, 2016, Capital One, N.A.
also elected to waive the Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio, calculated as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively,
in accordance with Section 7.15(a) of the Loan and Security Agreement. Although we were able to obtain waivers for our loan covenants
violations we may not meet the requirements of our covenants throughout the end of the extension period of the loan. At September
30, 2016, we had unused credit available under our current facility of approximately $2,542,092.  

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates   

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses. On
an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgment, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses,
financing operations and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgment on historical experience and
on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following represents a summary of our critical
accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.  

Revenue Recognition   

Under our sales model, a customer is obligated to pay
us for products sold to it within a specified number of days from the date that title to the products is transferred to the customer.
Our standard terms are typically net 30 days from the transfer of title to the products to a customer, however we have negotiated
special terms with certain customers and industries. We typically collect payment from a customer within 30 to 60 days from the
transfer of title to the products to a customer. Transfer of title occurs and risk of ownership passes to a customer at the time
of shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of our agreement with a particular customer. The sale price of our products is
substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale based on purchase orders generated by a customer and accepted by us. A
customer s obligation to pay us for products sold to it is not contingent upon the resale of those products. We recognize
revenue at the time title is transferred to a customer.  

In the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company
entered into patent licensing agreements with multiple companies. The licenses are for a fixed fee and are non-cancellable by
the licensee. The Company has no significant continuing obligation with regards to the use of the patent and the license arrangements
are treated as an outright sale. The total value of these agreements was $365,000.  

Revenue Disclosures   

The Company s revenues are derived substantially
from the sale of our core line of task specific work gloves, available to all of our customers, both domestically and internationally.  Below
is a table outlining this breakdown for the comparative periods:  

Inventory Obsolescence Allowance   

We review the inventory level of all products quarterly.
For most glove products that have been in the market for one year or greater, we consider inventory levels of greater than one
year s sales to be excess. Due to limited market penetration for our apparel products we have decided to provide a 50% allowance
against this line of products. Products that are no longer part of the current product offering are considered obsolete. The potential
for re-sale of slow-moving and obsolete inventories is based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The
recorded cost of obsolete inventories is then reduced to zero and a reserve is established for slow moving products. Both the
write down and reserve adjustments are recorded as charges to cost of goods sold. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015 we decreased our inventory reserve by $300,251 and $0 with the corresponding adjustments in cost of goods
sold, respectively, and reported an obsolescence reserve balance of $247,549 as of September 30, 2016 and $547,800 as of December
31, 2015. The reduction in the inventory obsolescence allowance of $300,251 over the nine month period ended September 30, 2016
is due to the sale of a portion of the glove and apparel inventory that we had previously reserved. All adjustments for obsolete
inventory establish a new cost basis for that inventory as we believe such reductions are permanent declines in the market price
of our products. Generally, obsolete inventory is sold to companies that specialize in the liquidation of these items or contributed
to charities, while we continue to market slow-moving inventories until they are sold or become obsolete. As obsolete or slow-moving
inventory is sold or disposed of, we reduce the reserve.  

   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our current customers consist primarily of large
national, regional and smaller independent customers with good payment histories with us. We perform periodic credit evaluations
of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on management s evaluation of historical experience
and current industry trends. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. New customers are evaluated for credit worthiness before terms
are established. Although we expect to collect all amounts due, actual collections may differ.  In the third quarter
of 2016 we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $489,000 to provide for the estimate of uncollectible 2015 receivables
net of inventories expected to be returned from our former Canadian distributor. This return was accepted in order to allow us
to refocus and rebuild our Canadian distribution to enable us to service our major customers in Canada and due to the distributor s
inability to meet its financial obligations to us.  

Product Returns, Allowances and Adjustments   

Product returns, allowances and adjustments is a broad
term that encompasses a number of offsets to gross sales. Included herein are warranty returns of defective products, returns
of saleable products and sales adjustments.  

Warranty Returns  - We have a warranty policy that
covers defects in workmanship. It allows customers to return damaged or defective products to us following a customary return
merchandise authorization process for a period of one year from the date of purchase.  

Saleable Product Returns  - We may allow from time
to time, depending on the customer and existing circumstances, stock adjustment returns, whereby the customer is given the opportunity
to  trade out  of a style of product that does not sell well in their territory, usually in exchange for another product,
again following the customary return merchandise authorization process. In addition we may allow from time to time other saleable
product returns from customers for other business reasons, for example, in settlement of an outstanding accounts receivable, from
a discontinued distributor customer or other customer service purpose.  

Sales Adjustments  - These adjustments include pricing
and shipping corrections and periodic adjustments to the product returns reserve.  

For both warranty and saleable product returns we utilize
actual historical return rates to determine our allowance for returns in each period, adjusted for unique, one-time events. Gross
sales is reduced by estimated returns. We record a corresponding accrual for the estimated liability associated with the estimated
returns which is based on the historical gross sales of the products corresponding to the estimated returns. This accrual is offset
each period by actual product returns.  

Our current estimated future warranty product return rate
is approximately 1.0% of the trailing twelve months net sales. As noted above, our return rate is based upon our past history
of actual returns and we estimate amounts for product returns for a given period by applying this historical return rate and reducing
actual gross sales for that period by a corresponding amount. We believe that using a trailing 12-month return rate provides us
with a sufficient period of time to establish recent historical trends in product returns for two primary reasons:  (i)
our products  useful life is approximately 3-4 months and (ii) we are able to quickly correct any significant quality issues
as we learn about them. If an unusual circumstance exists, such as a product that has begun to show materially different actual
return rates as compared to our average 12-month return rates, we will make appropriate adjustments to our estimated return rates.
Factors that could cause materially different actual return rates as compared to the 12-month return rates include a new product
line, a change in materials or product being supplied by a new factory. Although we have no specific statistical data on this
matter, we believe that our practices are reasonable and consistent with those of our industry. Our warranty terms under our arrangements
with our suppliers do not provide for individual products returned by retailers or retail customers to be returned to the vendor.  

Stock Based Compensation   

We follow the
provisions of FASB ASC 718,   Share-Based Payment.    This statement establishes standards for the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, as well as transactions
in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.  ASC 718 requires that the cost
resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the share-based
payment.  ASC 718 establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment transactions
with employees, such as the options issued under our stock incentive plans.  

Income Taxes   

Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability
method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates as of the date of enactment.  

When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that
some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about
the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be effectively sustained. The benefit of a tax position
is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it
is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation,
if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement
with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount
measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet
along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.  As
of September 30, 2016, we reviewed current profitability and forecasted future results and concluded that it is more likely than
not that we will not be able to realize any of our deferred tax assets. In recognition of this risk, we increased the valuation
allowance by $1,832,000 on the deferred taxes for the period ended September 30, 2016. We will continue to evaluate if it is more
likely than not that we will realize the future benefits from current and future deferred tax assets. These deferred tax benefits
are recorded on the balance sheet as long term deferred tax assets of $0 and $1,832,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.  

Interest and
penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes in the statement of operations.  

Results of Operations   

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015   

Net Sales  increased $1,034,212 or 19.1% ,  to
$6,454,723 in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $5,420,511 for the corresponding period in 2015. Two customers accounted
for 33.0% of Net Sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and one customer accounted for 24.5% of Net Sales during the
quarter ended September 30, 2015. The Net Sales increase for the quarter is due to increases in our industrial, international
and retail sales and the increase in the patent licensing fees. Patent licensing fees earned during the three month period ended
September 30, 2016 was $116,103. This is partially offset by a decrease in the private label sales.  The sales increase
in our industrial sales was primarily due to our increased business with Grainger.  

Gross Profit  increased $347,794 to $2,264,227 for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $1,916,433 for the corresponding period in 2015. Gross Profit, as a percentage of net
sales, or gross margin, represented 35.1% for the third quarter of 2016 and 35.4% for the third quarter of 2015. The increase
in gross profit dollars is primarily driven by the impact of 19% higher net sales and the patent license fees. This decrease in
gross margin is primarily due to ramp-up costs of initiating our new program with Grainger. This includes expediting product from
the factories to Grainger and certain start-up costs in distribution and operations.  

Operating Expenses  increased $483,384 to $2,574,903
in the three month period ending September 30, 2016 from $2,091,519 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. As a
percentage of net sales, Operating Expenses represented 39.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 38.6%
of net sales for the same period in 2015. The majority of the increase is driven by approximately $489,000 of bad debt expense
related to the discontinuance of our relationship with our Canadian distributor and increases in wages and benefit costs to service
the Grainger business and generate new business, offset by the recovery realized from the settlement of the litigation with ORR.  

Loss from Operations  increased by $135,590, to
a loss of $310,676 in the third quarter of 2016, from a loss of $175,086 in the third quarter of 2015. Loss from operations as
a percentage of net sales increased to 4.8% in the third quarter of 2016 from 3.2% in the third quarter of 2015.  The
increase in loss from operations in the third quarter was primarily due to increased operating expenses.  

Interest Expense  increased $15,299 to $45,992 in
the third quarter of 2016 from $30,693 in the same period of 2015. This increase is due to greater borrowings under our bank line
of credit agreement which were utilized to fund the increased accounts receivable and inventory levels.  

Net Loss Before Provision for Income Taxes  increased
$150,871 to a loss of $356,643 in the third quarter of 2016 from a loss of $205,772 in the third quarter of 2015.  
The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to higher operating expenses as outlined above.  

Deferred Income Tax Expense  increased $1,832,000
in the third quarter of 2016 from $0 in the third quarter of 2015.   The increase is due to the increase in the valuation
allowance for the deferred tax asset during the quarter.  

Net Loss  increased $1,982,871 to a loss of $2,188,643
in the third quarter of 2016 from a loss of $205,772 in the third quarter of 2015.   The increase in net loss is primarily
attributable to the deferred tax adjustment discussed above.  

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015   

Net Sales  increased $1,737,761 or 11.5% ,  to
$16,897,920 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $15,160,159 for the corresponding period in 2015. Two customers accounted
for 34.2% of Net Sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and three customers accounted for 44.9% of Net Sales for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Net Sales increase for the nine month period is due to increases in industrial
and retail sales and the increase in the patent licensing fees, offset in part by decreases in our international and private label
sales. Patent licensing fees earned during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $368,103. We continue to focus our
sales efforts on those areas where we see growth opportunities, the industrial and safety markets and job specific and specialty
glove styles.  

Gross Profit  increased $575,048 to $6,034,683 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,459,635 in the prior year period. Gross Profit, as a percentage of net sales,
or gross margin, decreased to 35.7% on a year-to-date basis from 36.0% for the same period of 2015. The decrease in gross profit
percentage points of 0.3% was primarily due to ramp up costs of initiating our new program with Grainger. This includes expediting
product from the factories to Grainger and certain start-up costs in distributions and operations.  

Operating Expenses  increased $1,360,820 to $7,229,428
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5,868,608 for the corresponding period in 2015. As a percentage of
net sales, Operating Expenses represented 42.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 38.7% of net sales for
the same period in 2015. The majority of the increase is driven by approximately $489,000 of bad debt expense related to the discontinuation
of business with our Canadian distributor. The balance of the variance is primarily due to an increase in wage and benefit costs.
Part of this increase comes from additional headcount required to service the Grainger business and generate new business. The
remainder of the wage and benefit increase is attributable to the year-over-year impact of post third quarter 2015 new hires.
Our number of employees was 43 at September 30, 2016 and 38 at September 30, 2015.  

Loss from Operations  increased by $785,772 to a
loss of $1,194,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from a loss of $408,973 in the corresponding period of 2015.
The increase in loss from operations in the nine month period was primarily due to increased operating expenses.  

Interest Expense  increased $64,037 to $129,672
in the first nine months of 2016 from $65,635 in the same period of 2015. This increase is due to greater borrowings under our
bank line of credit agreement which were utilized to fund the increased accounts receivable and inventory levels.  

Net Loss Before Provision for Income Taxes  increased
$849,780 to a loss of $1,324,367 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from a loss of $474,587 in the prior year period.
This increased loss was primarily the result of increased operating expenses.  

Deferred Income Tax Expense  increased $1,832,000
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 from $0 in 2015.   The increase is due to the increase in the valuation
allowance for the deferred tax asset.  

Net Loss  increased $2,681,110 to a loss of $3,155,697
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from a loss of $474,587 for the same period in 2015.   The increase in
net loss is primarily attributable to the deferred tax adjustment discussed above and the increase in operating expenses.  

Seasonality and Quarterly Results   

Our glove business generally shows an increase in sales
during the third and fourth quarters due primarily to an increase in the sale of our winter glove line during this period and
fall promotions.  We typically generate 55% - 65% of our glove net sales during these months.  The first and
second quarters of the year are generally considered our slower season.  Even though the overall economy continues to
exhibit moderate and uneven growth, which affects some of our channels, we have been experiencing some mixed growth in certain
channels, international and private label, which helps offset declines in other areas.  

Our working capital, at any particular time, reflects
the seasonality of our glove business and plans to expand product lines and enter new markets.    

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our cash requirements are principally for working capital.
Our need for working capital is seasonal, with the greatest requirements from June through the end of December each year as a result
of our inventory build-up during this period for the fall and winter selling seasons. Historically, our main sources of liquidity
have been borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility, the issuance of subordinated debt and the sale of equity.  In
the short term we monitor our credit issuances and cash collections to maximize cash flows and investigate opportunities to reduce
our current inventories to convert these assets into cash.  Over the past several years, and continuing in the near
and longer term we are focused on controlling our operating costs, while at the same time, investing for the growth of the business,
managing margins and improving operating procedures to generate sustained profitability.  

On November 28, 2014 we entered into a Revolving Loan
and Security Agreement with Capital One, N.A. which currently provides a revolving loan of up to $8,000,000. The loan was due
to expire on November 30, 2016. On September 16, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we increased the line limit from
$6,000,000 to $8,000,000. All advances, up to the line limit of $8,000,000, are subject to a Borrowing Base report. The term Borrowing
Base means an amount equal to (a) 80% of the net amount of all eligible accounts receivable plus, (b) 50% of the value of eligible
landed inventory, plus (c) 35% of eligible in-transit inventory. In addition, the outstanding principal amount of all advances
against eligible inventory shall not exceed 50% of the total line limit. All of our assets secure amounts borrowed under the terms
of this agreement. Interest on borrowed funds accrued at LIBOR plus 2.80% until such time as the Company s trailing twelve
month EBITDAS (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Stock compensation expense) exceeded $1,000,000
at which time the rate decreased to LIBOR plus 2.50%. The interest rate at September 30, 2016 was 3.023%. This agreement contains
a Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio covenant and a Tangible Net Worth covenant. On March 16, 2016, the Company modified its
Revolving Loan and Security Agreement with Capital One, N.A. which allowed the Company to add certain legal expenses of up to
$325,000 in the calculation of EBITDAS for the trailing twelve month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December
31, 2016 and permit including certain receivables of up to $300,000 in the definition of eligible accounts receivable in determining
the Borrowing Base.  

On November 7, 2016, Capital One, N.A. granted the Company
a 90-day extension of the maturity date from November 30, 2016 to February 28, 2017. Capital One, N.A. has also stated that additional
extensions and/or renewals will be considered, as necessary. During this extension, the Company s intent is to renew the
line with Capital One, N.A. and has already commenced talks with them to begin the process. We cannot assure that we would be
able to successfully renew or replace the line of credit described above that would allow us to meet our debt obligations.  

On November 7, 2016 and August 9, 2016, Capital One, N.A.
also elected to waive the Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio, calculated as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively,
in accordance with Section 7.15(a) of the Loan and Security Agreement. Although we were able to obtain waivers for our loan covenants
violations we may not meet the requirements of our covenants throughout the end of the extension period of the loan. At September
30, 2016, we had unused credit available under our current facility of approximately $2,542,092.  

The Company utilized cash flow from operations of $2,137,511
in the first nine months of 2016. The cash flow utilized from operations is primarily the result of increases in inventory, prepaid
expenses and other non-current assets, offset by decreases in accounts receivable and deposits on inventory and an increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in inventory of $1,440,582 (net of change in allowance of inventory obsolescence
of $300,251) from December 31, 2015 is attributable to the build-up of inventory to service our greatly expanded program with
Grainger and the introduction of our new Vibram/IVE lines. It is projected that inventory levels will reduce during Q4 of 2016.  

The Company generated approximately $2,367,761, net, of
cash flow in financing activities primarily from borrowings against the line of credit.  

We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings
available to us under the revolving credit facility (which comes due in November 2016 and which we intend to either renew or replace
with another line of credit), the availability of purchase order financing and our continuing cost containment measures will be
adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.  

Our ability to access these sources of liquidity may be
negatively impacted by the non-renewal or replacement of our revolving credit facility, a decrease in demand for our products
and/or the requirement that we meet certain borrowing conditions and debt covenants under our revolving credit facility.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   

At September 30, 2016, we did not have any relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, variable interest
or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market
or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

Not applicable.  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Controls and Procedures   

As of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered
by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission under the 1992 Framework (COSO). The COSO Commission has recently adopted a revision of the Internal Control-Integrated
Framework which became effective for us in December 2014. We expect to be in full compliance later this year.  

Our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls
over financial reporting, provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that all deficiencies in design and or operation of
those control systems, or all instances of errors or fraud, will be prevented or detected.  Those control systems are
designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the goals of those systems in light of our resources and nature of our business
operations.  Our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting, remain subject to
risks of human error and the risk that controls can be circumvented for wrongful purposes by one or more individuals in management
or non-management positions.  

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

During the last fiscal quarter, there have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
