Notes  to the Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)    1.          Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business    Mobetize    Corp.    (the     Company )    was    incorporated    in    the    state    of    Nevada    on    February    23,    2012,    as   Slavia, Corp. The Company s name changed to  Mobetize Corp on August 13, 2013.   The    Company    provides    Fintech    solutions    and    services    to    enable    and    support  the    convergence    of   global     telecom     and     financial     services     providers     ( Customers )     through     its     Global     Mobile     B2B   Fintech and Financial Services Marketplace ( Hub ).   The    Company s  activities    are    subject    to    significant    risks    and    uncertainties,    including    the    need    to   secure    additional    funding    to    optimize    the    Company s    existing    technology    before    another    company   develops competitive products.     Going Concern     These    consolidated    financial    statements    have    been    prepared    on    a    going    concern    basis,    which    implies   that    the    Company    will    continue    to    realize    assets    and    discharge    liabilities    in    the    normal    course    of   business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,930,858, a history   of    net    losses    and    a    working    capital    deficiency    of    $579,003.    These    factors    raise    substantial    doubt   regarding the Company s    ability to    continue    as    a    going    concern.    The    continuation    of    the Company as   a    going    concern    is    dependent    upon    continuing    financial    support    from    management,    increasing    sales,   securing    debt    or    equity    financing,    cutting    operating    costs,    launching    viable    products,    and    realizing   profitable    operations.    These    financial    statements    do    not    include    any adjustments    to    the    recoverability   and    classification    of    recorded    asset    amounts    and    classification    of    liabilities    that    might    be    necessary   should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.    2.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    a)      Basis of Presentation   These   unaudited     financial   statements     are     those   of   the     Company     and     its     wholly     owned   subsidiaries,    Mobetize    Canada    Inc.,    and    Mobetize    USA    Inc.    In    the    opinion    of    management,    the   accompanying     Consolidated     Financial     Statements     of     the     Company     contain     all     adjustments,   consisting    only    of    normal    recurring    adjustments,    necessary    to    fairly    state    its    financial    position    as   of    September    30,    2016    and    March    31,    2016    and    its    results    of    operations    and    cash    flows    for    the   three    and    six    month    periods    ended    September    30,    2016    and    September    30,    2015    in    accordance   with    generally    accepted    accounting    principles    of    the    United    States    of    America    ( U.S.    GAAP ).   Operating     results     for     the     three     and     six     month     periods     ended     September     30,     2016     are     not   necessarily indicative    of    the    results    that    may be    experienced    for    the    fiscal    year    ending    March    31,   2017.   8           MOBETIZE CORP.    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)    2.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    b)      Use of Estimates   The    preparation    of    financial    statements    in    conformity    with    US    GAAP    requires    management    to   make    estimates    and    assumptions    that    affect    the    reported    amounts    of    assets    and    liabilities    and   disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the   reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.   The  Company  regularly  evaluates  estimates  and  assumptions  related  to  the  collectability  of   accounts    receivable,    revenue    recognition,    fair    value    of    stock-based    compensation,    and    deferred   income    tax    asset    valuation    allowances.    The    Company    bases    its    estimates    and    assumptions    on   current    facts,  historical    experience    and    various    other    factors    that    it    believes    to    be    reasonable   under    the    circumstances,    the    results    of    which    form    the    basis    for    making    judgments    about    the   carrying    values    of    assets    and    liabilities    and    the    accrual    of    costs    and    expenses    that    are    not    readily   apparent     from     other     sources.     The     actual     results     experienced     by     the     Company     may     differ   materially     and     adversely     from     the     Company s     estimates.     To     the     extent     there     are     material   differences  between  the  estimates  and  the  actual  results,  future  results  of  operations  will  be   affected.   c)      Financial Statements   These    consolidated    financial    statements    have    been    prepared    in    the    opinion    of    management    to   reflect    all    adjustments,    which    include    only    normal    recurring    adjustments,    necessary    to    present   fairly    the    Company s  financial  position,  results  of    operations    and    cash  flows  for    the  periods   shown.    The    results    of    operations    for    such    periods    are    not    necessarily    indicative    of    the    results   expected for a full year or for any future period.   d)      Cash   The    Company considers all    highly liquid instruments    with    maturity of    three    months    or    less    at    the   time    of    issuance    to    be    cash    equivalents.    As    of    September    30,    2016,    and    March    31,    2016,    the   Company had no cash equivalents.   e)      Accounts Receivable   The    Company    evaluates    the    collectability    of    accounts    receivable    based    on    the    age    of    receivable   balances    and    customer    credit-worthiness.    If    the    Company    determines    that    financial    conditions    of   its customers    have    deteriorated,    an allowance    for doubtful    accounts    may be    made    or the    accounts   receivable written off if all collection attempts have failed.   f)    Prepaid Expenses and deposits   The    Company pays    for    some    services    in    advance    and    recognizes    these    expenses as    prepaid    at    the   balance    sheet    date.    If    certain    prepaid    expenses    extend    beyond    one-year,    those    are    classified    as   non-current assets.   9           MOBETIZE CORP.    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)    2.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    g)      Revenue Recognition   The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  payment  processing,  licensing  and  the  provision  of   professional    services.    Revenue    will    be    recognized    only    when    the    price    is    fixed    and    determinable,   persuasive    evidence    of    an    arrangement    exists,    the    service    has    been    provided,    and collectability is   reasonably assured.   h)      Property and Equipment   Property    and  equipment  is  accounted  for  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  includes   computer equipment and office furniture. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method   over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are five years.   i)    Research and Development Costs   The    Company    incurs    research    and    development    costs    during    the    course    of    its    operations.    The   costs    are    expensed    except    in    cases    where    development    costs    meet    certain    identifiable    criteria    for   capitalization.   Capitalized   development   costs   are     amortized   over   the   life   of   the   related   commercial production.   j)    Stock-Based Compensation   The    Company    records    stock-based    compensation    in    accordance    with    ASC    718,       Compensation              Stock        Compensation,     which    requires    the    measurement    and    recognition    of    compensation    expense   based  on  estimated  fair  values  for  all  share-based  awards  made  to  employees  and  directors,   including stock options.   ASC    718 requires companies to estimate the    fair    value of share-based awards on the date of grant   using    an    option-pricing    model.    The    Company uses    the    Black-Scholes    option-pricing    model    as    its   method of determining fair value. This model is affected by the Company s    stock price    as well as   assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables.   These    subjective    variables    include,    but    are    not    limited    to    the    Company s    expected    stock    price   volatility    over    the    term    of    the    awards,    and    actual    and    projected    employee    stock    option    exercise   behaviors.    The    value    of    the    portion    of    the    award    that    is    ultimately expected    to    vest    is    recognized   as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.   Options    granted to consultants are    valued at    the fair    value of    the equity instruments issued,    or    the   fair value of the services received, whichever is more reliably measureable.   10           MOBETIZE CORP.    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)    2.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    k)      Income Taxes   Deferred    income    taxes    are    determined    using    the    liability    method    for    the    temporary    differences   between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities.   Deferred    income    taxes    are    measured    based    on    the    tax    rates    expected    to    be    in    effect    when    the   temporary differences are included in the Company s tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities   are    recognized    based    on    anticipated    future    tax    consequences    attributable    to    differences    between   financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.   The    Company s  policy    is    to    recognize    penalties  and    interest,  if    any,  related    to    uncertain    tax   positions as general and administrative expense.   l)    Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share   The    Company    computes    net    income    (loss)    per    share    in    accordance    with    ASC    260,    Earnings    per   Share. ASC    260 requires    presentation of basic and diluted earnings    per share    ( EPS )    on the face   of  the  income  statement.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  by  dividing  net  loss  available  to  common   shareholders    and    preferred    shareholders    (numerator)    by    the    weighted    average    number    of    shares   outstanding    (denominator)    during    the    period.    Diluted    EPS    gives    effect    to    all    potentially    dilutive   common    shares    outstanding    during    the    period    using    the    treasury    stock    method    and    convertible   preferred stock    using    the if-converted    method.    In    computing    diluted EPS,    the    average    stock    price   for    the    period    is    used    in    determining    the    number    of    shares    assumed    to    be    purchased    from    the   exercise    of    stock    options    or    warrants.    Diluted    EPS    excludes    all    dilutive    potential    shares    if    their   effect    is    anti-dilutive.    Due    to    the    continued    losses    in    the    Company,    all    convertible    instruments,   stock options, and    warrants are considered anti-dilutive. Consequently,    as of September 30, 2016,   the Company has nil (March 31, 2016   nil) potentially dilutive shares.   m)     Comprehensive Loss   ASC     220,        Comprehensive         Income ,     establishes     standards     for     the     reporting     and     display     of   comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements.   11           MOBETIZE CORP.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    n)      Financial Instruments/Fair Value   Pursuant     to     ASC     820,        Fair         Value         Measurements  and  Disclosures ,     an  entity  is     required     to   maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  when   measuring     fair     value.     ASC     820     establishes     a     fair     value     hierarchy     based     on     the     level     of   independent,    objective    evidence    surrounding    the    inputs    used    to    measure    fair    value.    A    financial   instrument s    categorization    within the    fair    value hierarchy is    based    upon the lowest level    of input   that    is    significant    to    the    fair    value    measurement.    ASC    820    prioritizes    the    inputs    into    three    levels   that may be used to measure fair value:    Level 1    Level    1    applies    to    assets    or    liabilities    for    which    there    are    quoted    prices    in    active    markets    for   identical assets or liabilities.    Level 2    Level    2    applies    to    assets    or    liabilities    for    which    there    are    inputs    other    than    quoted    prices    that    are   observable    for    the    asset    or    liability    such    as    quoted    prices    for    similar    assets    or    liabilities    in    active   markets;    quoted    prices    for    identical    assets    or    liabilities    in    markets    with    insufficient    volume    or   infrequent    transactions    (less    active    markets);    or    model-derived    valuations    in    which    significant   inputs    are    observable    or    can    be    derived    principally    from,    or    corroborated    by,    observable    market   data.    Level 3    Level    3    applies    to    assets    or    liabilities    for    which    there    are    unobservable    inputs    to    the    valuation   methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   Financial  instruments  consist  principally  of  cash,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable  and   accrued liabilities, deposits due to customers, promissory note, shareholder loans, and convertible   debentures.  Pursuant    to    ASC    820,   Fair        Value        Measurements        and        Disclosures   and    ASC  825,    Financial        Instruments     the    fair    value    of    cash    is    determined    based    on     Level    1     inputs,    which   consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.   The  recorded  values  of  all  other  financial  instruments  approximate  their  current  fair  values   because    of    their    nature    and    respective    relatively short    maturity dates    and    current    market    rates    for   similar  instruments.  The  Company  is     exposed     to  credit     risk  through     its     cash     and     accounts   receivable,     but     mitigates     this     risk     by     keeping     deposits     at     major     financial     institutions     and   advancing    credit    only    to    bona    fide    creditworthy    entities.    The    maximum    amount    of    credit    risk    is   equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.   12           MOBETIZE CORP.    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)    2.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    o)      Embedded Conversion Features   The    Company    evaluates    embedded    conversion    features    within    convertible    debt    under    ASC    815    Derivatives        and        Hedging     to    determine    whether    the    embedded    conversion    feature(s)    should    be   bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in   fair     value     recorded     in     income     (loss).     If     the     conversion     feature     does     not     require     derivative   treatment    under    ASC    815,    the    instrument    is    evaluated    under    ASC    470-20,       Debt        with        Conversion     and Other Options  for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature.   p)      Derivative Financial Instruments   The    Company    does    not    use    derivative    instruments    to    hedge    exposures    to    cash    flow,    market,    or   foreign    currency    risks.    The    Company    evaluates    all    of    its    financial    instruments,    including    stock   purchase    warrants    and    stock    options,    to    determine    if    such    instruments    are    derivatives    or    contain   features that qualify as embedded derivatives.   For    derivative    financial    instruments    that    are    accounted    for    as    liabilities,    the    derivative    instrument   is    initially    recorded    at    its    fair    value    and    is    then    re-valued    at    each    reporting    date,    with    changes    in   the    fair    value    reported    as    charges    or    credits    to    income    (loss).    For    option-based    simple    derivative   financial    instruments,    the    Company    uses    the    Black-Scholes    option-pricing    model    to    value    the   derivative     instruments     at     inception     and     subsequent     valuation     dates.     The     classification     of   derivative    instruments,    including    whether    such    instruments    should    be    recorded    as    liabilities    or    as   equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.   q)      Beneficial Conversion Feature   For  conventional  convertible  debt  where  the  rate  of  conversion  is  below  market  value,  the   Company records a Beneficial Conversion Feature (the "BCF") and related debt discount.   When    the    Company    records    a    BCF,    the    intrinsic    value    of    the    BCF    is    recorded    as    a    debt    discount   against the face amount of the respective debt instrument (offset to    additional paid-in    capital)    and   amortized    to interest    expense    over    the    life    of the    debt. The Company has    determined    that there    is   no BCF with its convertible debt.   r)    Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount   The    Company may record    debt    issue costs    and/or    debt    discounts    in connection    with raising    funds   through    the    issuance    of    debt.    These    costs    may    be    paid    in    the    form    of    cash,    or    equity    (such    as   warrants).    These    costs    are    amortized    to    interest    expense    over    the    life    of    the    debt.    If    a    conversion   of    the    underlying    debt    occurs,    a    proportionate    share    of    the    unamortized    amounts    is    immediately   expensed.   13           MOBETIZE CORP.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    s)    Foreign Currency   The    functional    and    reporting    currency of    the    Company    and    its    subsidiary,    Mobetize    USA    Inc.,    is   the United States Dollar ( U.S. Dollars ). The functional currency of the Company s international   subsidiary,    Mobetize    Canada    Inc.,    is    the    Canadian    dollar.    The    Company    translates    the    financial   statements    of    this    subsidiary    to    U.S.    dollars    in    accordance    with    ASC    740,  Foreign    Currency   Translation Matters using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates   for the annual period are derived from daily spot rates for revenues and expenses.   Translation    gains    and    losses    are recorded in    accumulated    other comprehensive    income    (loss)    as a   component  of    stockholders   equity.  The    Company    has  not,  to  the  date  of  these    consolidated   financial    statements,    entered    into    derivative    instruments    to    offset    the    impact    of    foreign    currency   fluctuations.   t)    Recently Adopted Accounting Standards   In  June  2014,  ASU  guidance  was  issued  to  resolve  the  diversity  of  practice  relating  to  the   accounting    for    stock    based    performance    awards    that    the    performance    target    could    be    achieved   after the employee    completes the required service period. The update is effective prospectively or   retrospectively    for    annual    reporting    periods    beginning    after    December    15,    2015.    The    Company   adopted    this    ASU    on    April    1,    2016,    prospectively.   The    adoption    of    this    ASU    does    not    have    a   material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   In    January 2015,    an    ASU    was    issued    to    simplify the    income    statement    presentation    requirements   in    Subtopic    225-20    by    eliminating    the    concept    of    extraordinary    items.   Extraordinary    items    are   events    and    transactions    that    are    distinguished    by    their    unusual    nature    and    by    the    infrequency    of   their   occurrence.   Eliminating     the   extraordinary     classification   simplifies     income   statement   presentation    by    altogether    removing    the    concept    of    extraordinary    items    from    consideration.    This   ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods   within those annual periods.  An entity may apply this ASU prospectively or retrospectively to all   prior    periods    presented    in    the    financial    statements.    Early    adoption    is    permitted.   The    Company   adopted    this    ASU    on    April    1,    2016,    prospectively.   The    adoption    of    this    ASU    does    not    have    a   material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   14           MOBETIZE CORP.    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)    2.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued    u)      Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In    May    2014,    ASU    guidance    was    issued    related    to    revenue    from    contracts    with    customers.    The   new standard    provides a    five-step    approach    to be    applied to    all contracts    with    customers and also   requires     expanded     disclosures     about     revenue     recognition.     The     ASU     is     effective     for     annual   reporting    periods    beginning    after    December    15,  2017,    including    interim    periods    and    is    to    be   retrospectively     applied.     Early     application     is     permitted     only     as     of     annual     reporting     periods   beginning    after    December    15,    2016,    including    interim    reporting    periods    within    that    reporting   period.    The    Company    is    currently    evaluating    this    guidance    and    the    impact    it    will    have    on    its   consolidated financial statements.   In    November    2015,    an    ASU    was    issued    to    simplify    the    presentation    of    deferred    income    taxes.   The    amendments    in    this    ASU    require    that    deferred    tax    liabilities    and    assets    be    classified    as    non-   current    on    the    balance    sheet    as    compared    to    the    current    requirements    to    separate    deferred    tax   liabilities    and    assets    into    current    and    non-current    amounts.      This    ASU    is    effective    for    annual   periods     beginning     after     December     15,     2016,     including     interim     periods     within     those     annual   periods.    Earlier    application    is    permitted.   This    ASU    may    be    applied    either    prospectively    to    all   deferred    tax    liabilities    and    assets    or    retrospectively    to    all    periods    presented.      The    Company    is   currently  evaluating  this  guidance  and  the  impact  it  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financial   statements.   In    February 2016,    Topic    842,    Leases    was    issued    to    replace    the    leases    requirements    in    Topic    840,   Leases.     The    main    difference    between    previous    GAAP    and    Topic    842    is    the    recognition    of    lease   assets    and lease liabilities by lessees    for those leases    classified as operating leases under previous   GAAP.    A    lessee    should    recognize    in    the    balance    sheet    a    liability    to    make    lease    payments    (the   lease    liability)    and    a    right-of-use    asset    representing    its    right    to    use    the    underlying    asset    for    the   lease  term.  For  leases  with  a  term  of  12  months  or  less,  a  lessee  is  permitted  to  make  an   accounting    policy    election    by    class    of    underlying    asset    not    to    recognize    lease    assets    and    lease   liabilities.  If  a  lessee  makes  this  election,  it  should  recognize  lease  expense  for  such  leases   generally    on    a    straight-line    basis    over    the    lease    term.      The    accounting    applied    by    a    lessor    is   largely    unchanged    from    that    applied    under    previous    GAAP.      Topic    842    will    be    effective    for   annual    reporting    periods    beginning    after    December    15,    2018,    including    interim    periods    within   those    annual    periods    and    is    to    be    retrospectively    applied.   Earlier    application    is    permitted.   The   Company    is    currently    evaluating    this    guidance    and    the    impact    it    will    have    on    its    consolidated   financial statements.   In    March    2016,    an    ASU    was    issued    to    reduce    complexity    in    the    accounting    for    employee    share-   based    payment    transactions.   One    of    the    simplifications    relates    to    forfeitures    of    awards.   Under   current GAAP,    an entity estimates the    number    of    awards    for    which    the    requisite    service    period    is   expected    to    be    rendered    and    base    the    accruals    of    compensation    cost    on    the    estimated    number    of   awards    that    will    vest.      This    ASU    permits    an    entity    to    make    an    entity-wide    accounting    policy   election either to estimate the number of forfeitures expected to occur or to account for forfeitures   in    compensation    cost    when    they occur.     This    ASU    is    effective    for    annual    periods    beginning    after   December    15,    2016, including    interim    periods    within    those    annual    periods.     Earlier    application is   permitted.     The    Company    is    currently    evaluating    this    guidance    and    the    impact    it    will    have    on    its   consolidated financial statements.   15

The  Conversion  Feature   enables    the    holder    to    convert    any    portion    of    their    outstanding    Convertible    Debenture    principal   balance    into    common    shares    at    a    variable    and    discounted    conversion    price    ( Conversion    Price     -   see    below)    after    180    days    from    issue    date,    but    no    later    than    the    maturity    date.    The    Conversion   Price is calculated as a 50% discount to the average of the three lowest closing market prices over   any ten day trading period, ending one day prior to a notice of conversion provided    by the holder.   The    Conversion    Feature    represents    an    embedded    contingent    redemption    feature    and    is    accounted   for  as  a  derivative.    The  fair  value  of  the  contingent  redemption  feature  is  immaterial  and   therefore not recognized at inception, at March 31, 2016, and at September 30, 2016.

The Convertible Debenture has a 12 month term, 12%   annual  interest  rate,     pays     the  holder  12  months     of  prepaid  interest  on  issuance,  and  has     a   Conversion    Feature    exercisable    at    the    option    of    the    holder.    The    Conversion    Feature    enables    the   holder    to    convert    any    portion    of    their    outstanding    Convertible    Debenture    principal    balance    into   common    shares    at    a    variable    and    discounted    conversion    price    after    180    days    from    issue    date,    but   no    later    than    the    maturity    date.    The    Conversion    Price    is    calculated    as    a    50%    discount    to    the   average of the three lowest closing market prices over any ten-day trading period, ending one    day   prior    to    a    notice    of    conversion    provided    by    the    holder.    The    Conversion    Feature    represents    an   embedded    contingent    redemption    feature    and    is    accounted    for    as    a    derivative.     The    fair    value    of   the    contingent    redemption    feature    is    immaterial    and    therefore    not    recognized    at    inception    and    at   September 30, 2016.   20           MOBETIZE CORP.

On November 8, 2016, the Company entered an appeal alleging that the   calculation of amounts due to Fowler was incorrect and that Fowler had improperly obtained shares   of the Company s common stock which it intends to recover.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL     CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION    PRELIMINARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included   elsewhere in this Form 10-Q ( Report ). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to   future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking   statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,     estimates,   predicts,   potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable   terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties,   and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or   achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or   achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.   In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to   differ materially from any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the predictions reflected   in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity,   performance or achievements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those   expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any   forward-looking statements for any reason.   We are considered an emerging growth company. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on   the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016. The continuation of Mobetize as a going   concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify   future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, cutting operating costs,   launching a viable product, and generating profitable operations from our future operations.   Mobetize s plan of operation for the coming year is to complete the development and qualification of   products under development, and to increase sales of our existing products. Meanwhile, we will continue   internal research and development efforts and collaborate with development partners to ensure the   continuity of our product pipeline focused on the convergence of telecom and financial services.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses and Net Losses       US $     US $       Three Months Ended     Six Months Ended       September 30,     September 30,       2016     2015     2016     2015              Revenues   $   140,630   $   3,742  $   216,248    $   7,077     Operating Expenses   338,738   357,423   822,045   720,423     Net Loss   (198,108)   (353,681)   (605,797)   (713,346)     Operating Revenues     The Company generated $216,248 of revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to   revenues of $7,077 during the same period in 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the   Company generated $140,630 of revenue compared to $3,742 of revenue during the same period in 2015.   Revenues are currently generated through licensing, professional services, and payment processing   services provided by Mobetize to our existing customers.   26          The increase in revenues over the comparative three and six month periods can be attributed to an   increase in contract development revenue and the provision of professional services in the current three   and six month periods over the corresponding prior periods.   We expect that revenues will continue to increase in future periods as the Company anticipates its first   transactional revenues in the first half of the calendar year 2017.     Operating Expenses     Operating    expenses    for    the    three    and    six    months    ended    September    30,    2016    and    2015    are    outlined    in    the   following table:      US $     US $       Three Months Ended     Six Months Ended       September 30,     September 30,       2016     2015     2016     2015              Depreciation   795   655   1,600   1,431     Director compensation   27,000   -   27,000   -     General and administrative   86,529   67,880   175,056   112,422   General and administrative   related     party   4,277   1,722   6,960   3,156     Investor relations and promotion   15,010   7,155   49,525   7,155     Listing fees   5,302   8,956   9,354   21,191     Management salaries and consulting fees   16,080   63,479   51,790   173,845     Management fees   related party   15,000   30,000   37,500   60,000     Professional fees   12,002   10,743   96,705   38,010     Research and development   64,015   125,050   166,597   236,616   Research and development   related     party   30,896   12,205   58,050   12,836     Sales and marketing   51   29,578   7,269   53,761     Share compensation   7,200   -   7,200   -     Stock based compensation expense   54,581   -   127,439   -                  Total Operating Expenses    338,738   357,423   822,045   720,423           For the six months ended September 30, 2016, operating costs were $822,045 compared with $720,423   for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The $101,622 increase is primarily attributed to a $27,000   increase in director compensation due to a services agreement with a company controlled by the   Company s Chairman, a $62,634 increase in general and administrative expenses due to interest expense   incurred on outstanding promissory notes and an increase in expenses incurred in the normal course of   operations, a $42,370 increase in investor relations costs as we pursued additional efforts to raise   awareness in the public market, a $58,695 increase in professional fees mostly related to public company   disclosure, and a $127,439 increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of issuing stock   options to certain of the Company s employees and advisors. The overall increase in operating expenses   was partially offset by a $144,555 decrease in management salaries and consulting fees as we internalized   certain roles while optimizing the management structure to reduce overhead cost, a $24,805 decrease in   research and development expenses as certain products under development were completed, and a   $46,492 decrease in sales and marketing efforts intended to reduce overhead costs.   27          For the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating costs were $338,738 compared with $357,423   for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $18,685 decrease is primarily attributed to a $3,645   decrease in listing fees, the elimination of $63,479 in management salaries and consulting fees paid to the   former CFO, a $61,035 decrease in research and development expenses as certain products under   development are completed and a $29,527 decrease in sales and marketing intended to reduce overhead   costs. The overall decrease was partially offset by $27,000 increase in director compensation due to a   services agreement with a company controlled by the Company s Chairman a $18,649 increase in general   and administrative expenses due to interest expense incurred on outstanding promissory notes and an   increase in expenses incurred in the normal course of operations, a $2,555 increase in general and   administrative expenses due to amounts paid to a related party, a $7,855 increase in investor relations   costs as we pursued additional efforts to raise awareness in the public market, a $18,691 increase in   research and development expenses as certain products remain in development, $7,200  in share   compensation expenses and a $54,581 in stock compensation expenses as a result of issuing stock options   to certain of the Company s employees and advisors.   We expect that operating expenses will continue to increase over future periods as the Company strives to   expand its business as it focuses on research and development of products in its product pipeline and   expands its current revenue model to include transactional sales in 2017.     Net Losses     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $605,797   compared with a net loss of $713,346 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The $107,549   decrease in the net loss is due to a $209,171 increase in revenues, partially offset by a $101,622 increase   in total operating costs.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $198,108   compared with a net loss of $353,681 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $155,573   decrease in the net loss is primarily attributed to a $136,888 increase in revenues.   We    believe    that    net    losses    will    diminish    over    future    periods    as    revenue    is    expected    to    continue    to    grow   and operating efficiencies are implemented with a focus on the prospect of net profit.    Liquidity and Capital Resources     US $       September 30, 2016     March 31, 2016          Current Assets   $   154,749        $   318,827     Total Assets   164,863   330,655     Current Liabilities   733,752   541,185     Total Liabilities   793,747   588,661     Working Capital Deficiency   579,003   222,358   The Company had a working capital deficit of $579,003 as of September 30, 2016, and has funded its   cash needs since inception with revenues generated from operations, debt instruments and private equity   placements. Existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are not expected to be sufficient to fund   operations over the next twelve months.   28          Total current assets as of September 30, 2016, were $154,749 which consisted of $1,949 in cash, $96,758   in accounts receivable, $52,242 in prepaid expenses and deposits and $3,800 in prepaid expenses to a   related party. Total assets were $164,863 which consisted of current assets, and property and equipment   of $10,114.   Total current liabilities as of September 30, 2016, were $733,752 which consisted of accounts payable of   $218,871, accounts payable to a related party of $169,841, deposits due to customers of $980, a   promissory note due to a related party of $44,060 and convertible debentures of $300,000. Total liabilities   were $793,747 which consisted of current liabilities and shareholder loans of $59,995.   Stockholders  deficit as of September 30, 2016, was $628,884.    Cash Flows     US $     Six Months Ended     September 30,       2016     2015          Cash flows used in Operating Activities   (269,048)   (611,355)     Cash flows used in Investing Activities   -   (1,606)     Cash flows provided by Financing Activities   60,761   794,802     Effect of exchange rate changes on cash   (105)   (4,262)          Net Increase in Cash During Period    (208,392)   177,579         Cash flows used in Operating Activities     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $269,048 in operating activities as   compared to $611,355 of cash used in operating activities during the six months ended September 30,   2015.  The $342,307 change in cash used in operating activities over the comparative periods, is primarily   attributed to a number of items that are book expense items which do not affect the total amount relative   to actual cash used including depreciation, share based compensation, interest accrued on shareholder   loans, and shares issued to settle a promissory note with a related party. Balance sheet accounts that   actually affect cash, but are not income statement related items that are added or deducted to arrive at net   cash used in operating activities, include accounts receivable, shareholder loans, accounts payable and the   related party promissory note.   The Company expects to continue to use cash flow in operating activities until such time as diminishing   losses transition to profit on the expectation that revenues will continue to increase.     Cash flows used in Investing Activities     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $nil of cash in investing activities   compared to $1,606 in 2015. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended September 30,   2015 was due to purchase of computer equipment.   The Company expects to use cash flow in investing activities in future periods as it will require additional   investment to increase revenue.   29            Cash flows from Financing Activities     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, The Company received $60,761 of proceeds from   financing activities compared to $794,802 during the six months ended September 30, 2015. Proceeds   received during the six months ended September 30, 2016, were due to the issuance of convertible   debenture in the principal amount of $25,000 net of $3,000 in prepaid interest and the issuance of a   convertible debenture in the principal amount of $44,060 net of $5,314 in prepaid interest to the   Company s CEO. Proceeds received during the six months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of funds   raised from private placements that included $228,240 of related party placements by the CEO and former   CFO of the Company.   The    Company    expects    that    cash    flow    provided    by    financing    activities    will    continue    until    such    time    as    it   can increase revenue to a point at which it can maintain operations and grow its business.   PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING   We    expect    that    working    capital    requirements    will    continue    to    be    funded    through    a    combination    of    our   existing  funds  and  further  issuances  of  securities.  Our  working    capital  requirements  are  expected  to   increase in line with the growth of our business.   Further advances, equity instruments, debt instruments, and anticipated cash flows from operations are   expected to be obtained to fund our operations over the next twelve months. Generally, we have financed   operations to date through the proceeds of the private placements of equity, issuances of convertible   debentures, and advances by the way of promissory notes from directors. In connection with our business   plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating   to: (i) development expenses associated with a start-up business; and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend   to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect   we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet short-term operating requirements.   We have no current agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through   bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in   effect, our inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on our ability   to remain a viable company. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in   dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges   senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If   adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take   advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and   materially restrict our business operations.   We have no current material commitments for future capital expenditures.   We have no current defined benefit plan with any of our officers and directors. The Company does   maintain a stock option plan for directors, officers and eligible consultants.   We have no current material plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment.   We have no current plans to make any changes in the number of our employees.   We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   30          OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   As of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are   reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial   condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources   that are material to investors.   GOING CONCERN   The    independent    auditors'    report    accompanying    our    March    31,    2016,    financial    statements    contained    an   explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that   the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of   business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,930,858, a history of   net losses and cash used in operating activities, and working capital deficiency of $579,003. These factors   raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation   of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon continued financial support from management,   increasing revenue, procuring additional debt or equity financing as necessary, decreasing operating costs,   launching commercially viable products, and generating a profit. These financial statements do not   include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and   classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going   concern.   CRITITCAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our financial statements. While the   selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and   estimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements,   potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application, and are the most   susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions.   Mobetize recognizes revenue from payment processing, licensing, and provision of professional services.   Revenue will be recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an   arrangement exists, the service has been provided, and collectability is reasonably assured.   Stock-Based Compensation   Mobetize records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock     Compensation,  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on   estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options.   ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using   an option-pricing model. Mobetize uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as its method of   determining fair value. This model is affected by Mobetize s stock price as well as assumptions regarding   a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to Mobetize s   expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock   option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is   recognized as an expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period. Options granted   to consultants are valued at the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or the fair value of the services   received, whichever is more reliably measurable. Embedded Conversion Features   31          Mobetize evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815  Derivatives     and Hedging  to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host   instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income   (loss). If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is   evaluated under ASC 470-20,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  for consideration of any   beneficial conversion feature.   Derivative Financial Instruments   Mobetize does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign   currency risks. Mobetize evaluates all of it financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants and   stock options, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as   embedded derivatives.   For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is   initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair   value reported as charges or credits to income (loss). For option-based simple derivative financial   instruments, Mobetize uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at   inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether   such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting   period.   Beneficial Conversion Feature   For conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, Mobetize records a   Beneficial Conversion Feature and related debt discount.    ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE  AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    Not required of smaller reporting companies.   32           ITEM 4.  CONTROLS  AND PROCEDURES     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act   of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed   in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported   within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission   ( Commission ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including   the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required   disclosures.   Based on that evaluation, Mobetize s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this   report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing,   summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the   Commission s rules and forms, and such information was not accumulated and communicated to   management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely   decisions regarding required disclosures.    Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change in internal control over financial   reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over   financial reporting.   33            PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS    Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any   other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or   affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal   proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been   threatened against us or our properties except as follows below:     Stephen J. Fowler     The Company received a Citation and Notice of Assessment dated October 14, 2016 ( Citation ), that   Stephen J. Fowler ( Fowler ), its former CFO, had initiated a complaint with the State of Washington   Department of Labor and Industries for amounts allegedly due to him for unpaid wages. The Citation   declared that Fowler is owed $45,000 in wages in addition to an assessed interest of $3,368.74, and a   penalty of $4,500.  On November 8, 2016, the Company entered an appeal alleging that the calculation of   amounts due to Fowler was incorrect and that Fowler had improperly obtained shares of the Company s   common stock which it intends to recover. The Company received a response from the Department of   Labor and Industries dated November 18, 2016, in which it was advised that Fowler s claim had been   transferred to the Office of the Attorney General and that a hearing on the matter would be requested of   the Office of Administrative Hearings. A date for the hearing is yet to be assigned.    ITEM 1A.
