1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

General   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Quantum Materials Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary,
Solterra Renewable Technologies, Inc. (collectively referred to as the  Company ).  

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are unaudited and have
been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016. The
year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required
by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial information
includes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial information. Operating results for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of any subsequent periods. Certain information in the footnote disclosures
normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) has been condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented under the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) rules and regulations. As such, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.  

Nature
of Operations   

The
Company is a nanotechnology company specializing in the design, development, production and supply of quantum dots, including
tetrapod quantum dots, a high performance variant of quantum dots, and highly uniform nanoparticles, using its patented automated
continuous flow production process. Quantum dots and other nanoparticles are expected to be increasingly utilized in a range of
applications in the life sciences, television and display, solid state lighting, solar energy, battery, security ink, and sensor
sectors of the market. Key uncertainties and risks to the Company include, but are not limited to, if and how quickly various
industries adopt and fully embrace quantum dot technology and technological changes, including those developed by the Company s
competitors, rendering the Company s technology uncompetitive or obsolete.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company recorded losses from continuing operations in the current period presented and has a history of losses. The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to reverse negative operating trends, obtain revenues
from operations, raise additional capital, and/or obtain debt financing.  

In
conjunction with anticipated revenue streams, management is currently negotiating equity and debt financing, the proceeds from
which would be used to settle outstanding debts, to finance operations, and for general corporate purposes. However, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise capital, obtain debt financing, or improve operating results sufficiently
to continue as a going concern.  

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.

expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $23,015 and $20,409, respectively.  

NOTE
3   LICENSES AND PATENTS

NOTE
4   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-04
  Fair Value Measurement   as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities, which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions
of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.  

This
guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Hierarchical levels, as defined in this guidance and directly
related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities are as follows:  

Level
1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets
or liabilities.  

Level
2   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
(e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation
or other means.  

Level
3   Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.  

The
reported fair values for financial instruments that use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety
of factors and assumptions. Accordingly, certain fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that
could have been realized as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 or that will be realized in the future and do not include
expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement.  

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and current debt approximate their fair value due to the short
maturity of those instruments.  

Convertible
Debentures   

The
Company measured the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures using significant other observable inputs, representative
of a Level 2 fair value measurement, including the interest and conversion rates for the instruments. The following table sets
forth the fair value of the Company s convertible debentures as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:  

The
Company is not a party to any hedge arrangements or commodity swap agreements.  

NOTE
5   CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES   

The
following table sets forth activity associated with the convertible debentures:  

September
2014 Convertible Debenture   

Between
September 16, 2014 and October 28, 2014, the Company entered into Convertible Debenture Agreements to obtain a total of $500,050
in gross proceeds from five non-affiliated parties (collectively hereinafter referred to as the  Debenture Holders ).
The Debentures have terms of five years maturing between September 16, 2019 and October 30, 2019. The Debentures bear interest
at the rate of 6% per annum and are pre-payable by the Company at any time without penalty. The Debenture Holders have the right
of conversion into unregistered and restricted shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.15 per share at any date, and
will receive an equal number of warrants having a strike price of $0.30 per share and a term of five years.  

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $384 and $384, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, $25,050 of principal was outstanding.  

January
2015 Convertible Debenture   

On
January 15, 2015, the Company entered into Convertible Debenture Agreements to obtain $500,000 in gross proceeds from two non-affiliated
parties (collectively hereinafter referred to as the  Debenture Holders ). The Debentures have a term of two years
maturing on January 15, 2017 and bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum. The debentures are pre-payable by the Company at any
time without penalty. The Debenture Holders have the right of conversion into unregistered and restricted shares of Common Stock
at a conversion price of $0.06 per share at any date. The Debenture Holders received 6,250,000 common stock warrants exercisable
at $0.06 per share through January 15, 2017. The debt is secured by a security interest in certain microreactor equipment. The
Agreement also provides for the investors to have the right to appoint one member to the Company s Board of Directors in
the event that any one of the aforementioned debentures are converted into common stock of the Company.  

In
accounting for the convertible debentures, the Company allocated the fair value of the warrants to the proceeds received in the
amount of $348,105, recorded as debt discount and is amortized using the effective interest rate method over the life of the loan,
two years. The Company recognized accretion of debt discount expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of
$45,689 and $42,187, respectively. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $10,082 and $10,082,
respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, $500,000 of principal was outstanding. On October 10, 2016 the maturity date of the debentures was extended
to January 15, 2018 and were reclassified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet.  

April
  June and August 2016 Convertible Debentures   

During
the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold 1,565 Units for total proceeds of $1,565,000 from three affiliated
and fourteen non-affiliated parties. In August 2016 the Company sold 200 additional Units for total proceeds of $200,000. Each
Unit consists of a $1,000 Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note (each, a  Note ) and a warrant to purchase 4,166 shares
of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) at a purchase price of $0.15
per share (each, a  Warrant ) over a period of five years. The Notes which were issued at face value have a maturity
of two years from the date of issuance, bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum and are convertible into unregistered and restricted
shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per-share, subject to normal and customary adjustments including (a) any subdivisions, combinations
and classifications of the Common Stock; or (b) any payment, issuance or distribution by the Company to its stockholders of (i)
a stock dividend, (ii) debt securities of the Company, or (iii) assets (other than cash dividends payable out of earnings or surplus
in the ordinary course of business). The conversion price also is subject to a full ratchet adjustment upon the Company s
issuance of Common Stock, warrants, or rights to purchase Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock for a consideration
per share which is less than the then applicable conversion price of the Notes excluding Common Stock and options issued to officers,
directors, and employees of the Company, except for the exercise or conversion of existing convertible securities of the Company.
In evaluating the accounting treatment of this anti-dilution feature, the Company believes that is has control over whether or
not the anti-dilution feature will be exercised. The Company is able to decide on which type of financing is raised, and thus
the Company can prevent the issuance of shares at a price below the anti-dilution strike price. The number of Warrants and exercise
price is proportionately adjustable for events including subdivisions, combinations or consolidations, reclassifications, exchanges,
mergers, and reorganizations.  

In
accounting for the convertible debentures, the Company allocated the fair value of the warrants to the proceeds received in the
amount of $543,548, recorded as debt discount and is amortized using the effective interest rate method over the life of the loan,
two years. The Company recognized accretion of debt discount expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of
$62,104 and $0, respectively. The Company recognized a beneficial conversion expense for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 of $40,394 and $0, respectively. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $33,685
and $0, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, $1,765,000 of principal was outstanding.  

September
2016 Convertible Promissory Note   

In
September 2016 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory Note to obtain $100,000 in
gross proceeds from a non-affiliated party (collectively hereinafter referred to as the  Note Holder ) in exchange
for 200,000 unregistered and restricted shares of common stock of the Company and a convertible promissory note in the principal
amount of $100,000. The Note Holder received 250,000 common stock warrants exercisable at $0.12 per share through September 15,
2019. The promissory note has a term of eight months maturing on May 15, 2017 and stipulates a one-time interest charge of eight
percent (8%) shall be applied on the issuance date to the principal. The promissory note is pre-payable by the Company at any
time without penalty. The Note Holder has the right of conversion into unregistered and restricted shares of Common Stock at a
conversion price of $0.12 per share at any date. The promissory note includes piggyback registration rights and the Company
shall include on the next registration statement it files with the SEC all shares issuable upon conversion of the note.  

In
accounting for the convertible promissory note, the Company allocated the fair value of the common stock and warrants to the proceeds
received in the amount of $29,522, recorded as debt discount and is amortized using the effective interest rate method over the
life of the loan, eight months. The Company recognized accretion of debt discount expense for the three months ended September

costs related to the issuance of debt are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt and amortized
to interest expense using the effective interest method over the maturity period of the related debt. Amortization expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $15,509 and $0, respectively.

which was increased to 10,000,000 shares in December 2009 and approved by stockholders in January 2010. The Plan provides for
the direct issuance of common stock and the grant of incentive and non-incentive stock options. As of September 30, 2016, 9,200,000
options have been granted, with terms ranging from five to ten years, and 250,000 have been cancelled.  

In
March 2012, 3,500,000 stock options, with a term of five years, were granted outside of a stock option plan.  

In
January 2013 the Board of Directors authorized the approval of a stock option plan covering 20,000,000 shares of common stock,
which was increased to 60,000,000 shares in March 2013 and approved by stockholders in March 2013. The Plan provides for the direct
issuance of common stock and the grant of incentive and non-incentive stock options. As of September 30, 2016, 72,653,473 options

Incentive
Stock Options:  The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
valuation model. The volatility is based on expected volatility over the expected life of thirty-six to sixty months. Compensation
cost is recognized based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, therefore, the Company has reduced the cost for estimated
forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates, which were between 14% and 16% during the three months ended September 30, 2016.
As the Company has not historically declared dividends, the dividend yield used in the calculation is zero. Actual value realized,
if any, is dependent on the future performance of the Company s common stock and overall stock market conditions. There
is no assurance the value realized by an optionee will be at or near the value estimated by the Black-Scholes-Merton model.  

The
following assumptions were used for the periods indicated:  

The
computation of expected volatility during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was based on the historical volatility.
Historical volatility was calculated from historical data for the time approximately equal to the expected term of the option
award starting from the grant date. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
at the time of grant for the period corresponding with the expected life of the option.

NOTE
11   INCOME TAX   

The
Company follows ASC 740   Income Taxes   regarding the accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities. Under
the asset and liability method required by this guidance, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A deferred tax
asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance when, based on the Company s estimates, it is more likely than not that a
portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period.  

The
Company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from the existing deferred tax liabilities or future
taxable income. To the extent the Company believes that recovery will not meet the more likely than not threshold, it establishes
a valuation allowance. The Company has recorded valuation allowances in the U.S. for its net deferred tax assets since management
believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized because future taxable income necessary to utilize
these losses cannot be established or projected.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $27,000,000 in U.S. net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards
that expire beginning in 2029. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( IRC Section 382 ),
a corporation that undergoes an  ownership change , as defined therein, is subject to limitations on its use of pre-change
NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. The Company believes there is a 382 limitation on its NOLs that will substantially
limit the use of its NOLs in the future, including disallowing the use of a material portion of its NOLs. However, the Company
is currently evaluating whether an  ownership change  has occurred and, if so, what the annual limitation on NOL will
be in future periods. The Company anticipates this evaluation to be complete by the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year.
The Company has recorded a valuation allowance on the entire NOL as it believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred
tax asset associated with the NOLs will not be realized regardless of whether an  ownership change  has occurred.   

When
a company operates in a jurisdiction that generates ordinary losses but does not expect to realize them, ASC 740-270-30-36(a)
requires the exclusion of the respective jurisdiction from the overall annual effective tax rate ( AETR ) calculation
and instead, a separate AETR should be computed. The Company operates in one jurisdiction and has determined that its deferred
tax assets are not realizable on a more likely than not basis and has recorded a full valuation allowance.The effective income
tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 0%.

as gain on settlement.  

NOTE
14   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including
the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement
of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this
guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which updates guidance on accounting for leases. The update requires
that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to
make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Similar to
current guidance, the update continues to differentiate between finance leases and operating leases; however, this distinction
now primarily relates to differences in the manner of expense recognition over time and in the classification of lease payments
in the statement of cash flows. The standards update is effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2018 with
early adoption permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective adoption, with certain relief provisions, for
leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements when
adopted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated
financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  This ASU requires
entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. It thus simplifies
the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as current
and noncurrent. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance effective for the year ended June 30, 2016.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15  Preparation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  Under GAAP, continuation of a reporting entity
as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity s liquidation
becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis
of accounting. If and when an entity s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation
basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting.
Even when an entity s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared
under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this update should be followed to determine whether to disclose
information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending
after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will
continue to evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at this time, the Company has not adopted this standard.
The Company does not anticipate or expect adoption of this ASU will have a material effect to the consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . The revenue recognition standard affects all entities that have contracts with customers, except
for certain items. The new revenue recognition standard eliminates the transaction and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance
under current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and replaces it with a principle-based approach for determining
revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective
Date,  which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities are required to
adopt the revenue recognition standard for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  Early adoption of
this updated guidance is permitted as of the original effective date of December 31, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption
of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Business
Overview   

We
are a nanotechnology company specializing in the design, development, production and supply of nanomaterials, including quantum
dots ( QDs ), tetrapod quantum dots ( TQDs ), and other nanoparticles for a range of applications in televisions,
displays and other optoelectronics, photovoltaics, solid state lighting, life sciences, security ink, battery, and sensor sectors
of the market. We are currently trading in the over-the-counter marketplace on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol  QTMM. 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Solterra Renewable Technologies, Inc. ( Solterra ) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary
of QMC that is focused on the photovoltaic (solar cell) market.  

QDs
are nanoscale semiconductor crystals typically between 10 and 100 atoms in diameter. Approximately 10,000 would fit across the
diameter of a human hair. Their small size makes it possible for them to exhibit certain quantum mechanical properties. QDs emit
either photons or electrons when excited. In the case of photons, the wavelength (color) of light emitted varies depending on
the size of the quantum dot. As such, the photonic emissions can be tuned by the creation of QDs of different sizes. Their unique
properties as highly efficient, next generation semiconductors have led to the use of QDs in a range of electronic and other applications
in the biomedical, display, and lighting industries. QDs also have applications in solar cells, where their characteristics enable
conversion of light energy into electricity with the potential for significantly higher efficiencies and lower costs than existing
technologies, thereby creating the opportunity for a step change in the solar energy industry through the use of QDs in printed
photovoltaic cells.  

QDs
were first discovered in the early 1980s and the industry has developed to the point where QDs are now being used in an increasing
range of applications, including the television and display industries, the light emitting diode ( LED ) lighting
(also known as solid-state lighting) industry, and the biomedical industry. LG, Samsung, and other manufacturers have recently
launched new televisions using QDs to enhance the picture color quality and power efficiency. A number of major lighting companies
are developing product applications using QDs to create a more natural light for LEDs. The biomedical industry is using QDs in
diagnostic and therapeutic applications; and applications are being developed to print highly efficient photovoltaic solar cells
in mass quantities at a low cost.  

A
key challenge for the quantum dot industry has been and may continue to be its ability to scale up production volumes sufficiently
to meet growing demand for QDs while maintaining product quality and consistency and reducing the overall costs of supply to stimulate
new applications. QDs remain an expensive product, however a number of recent market research reports have forecasted rapid growth
of the QD market, including an April 2016 report by Credence Research which states  The quantum dots market is expected
to cross US$ 8.0 Bn by 2022, expanding at a CAGR of 51.3% during the forecast period 2015 to 2022,  and a report published
by Transparency Market Research, also in April 2014, which forecasts that  the market will develop at an exceptional 53.8%
CAGR between 2013 and 2023. If the projections hold true, the market could rise from a valuation of US$88.5 mn in 2011 to US$8.2
bn by 2023.   

In
2014, we acquired several patents and patent applications in five diverse sets of patent families from Bayer Technology Services
GmbH, the global technological backbone and major innovation driver for Bayer AG of Leverkusen, Germany (the  Bayer Patents ).
The Bayer Patents acquired provide broad intellectual property protection for advances we have achieved in economical high-volume
QD manufacturing. In addition, the Bayer Patents cover volume production technology for cadmium-free QDs and nanoparticles; increasing
quantum yields; and hybrid organic quantum dot solar cell ( QDSC ) production as well as a surface modification process
for increased efficiency of high performance solar cells and printed electronics.  

In
addition to the Bayer Patents, we have a worldwide exclusive license from William Marsh Rice University ( Rice ) to
a patented chemical process that permits it to produce high performance TQDs using a lower cost and environmentally friendly solvent
for greater manufacturing flexibility.  

We
have developed proprietary equipment that allows it to mass produce consistent quantities of QDs and TQDs in a continuous process
at lower capital costs than other existing processes. We also have the exclusive license from the University of Arizona ( UA )
to a patented technique for printing LEDs. We believe that these intellectual properties and proprietary technologies position
us to become a leader in the overall nanomaterials and quantum dot industry and a preferred supplier of high performance QDs and
TQDs to an expanding range of applications.  

Plan
of Operation   

We
currently operate from a leased facility in San Marcos, Texas at the STAR Park Technology Center, an extension of Texas State
University (the  San Marcos Facility ). This location provides us with convenient access to university faculty and
specialized laboratory facilities that can support joint research and development efforts with Texas State University. Located
approximately 30 miles south of Austin, Texas, this location is also in close proximity to a number of leading companies in the
electronics, lighting, solar, and life sciences markets.  

The
Company has established commercial-scale manufacturing equipment at the San Marcos facility and now has the capacity to produce
more than two metric tons (2,000kg) per year of quantum dots and other nanomaterials for supply to its customers. Management believes
that the production capacity of the San Marcos facility is similar to, or greater than its largest competitors  operating
factories which are much larger and required significantly higher capital expenditures. This efficiency is the direct result of
our patented continuous flow process and proprietary manufacturing knowhow and equipment. While we plan to work extensively with
its current provider of equipment, we own all rights to the designs and intellectual property resulting from the development project,
and could contract with one or more other competent suppliers of equipment, if necessary.  

We
expect to commence generating revenues from the production of materials at the San Marcos facility in early 2017. Such revenues
are expected to be modest at first and will be dependent upon our ability to generate purchase orders from development partners.  

Our
marketing strategy is to engage in strategic arrangements with manufacturers, distributors, and others to jointly develop applications
using its patented continuous production process. Such joint collaborations will involve us working closely with its industry
counterparts to optimize the performance of our materials in each application or device and to use the results from product development
and testing to further enhance product specifications. On July 15, 2015 we entered into a joint development agreement with an
unnamed major display panel manufacturer and on September 11, 2015 we entered into a funded product development agreement with
a leading global optical film manufacturer, Nitto Denko Corporation. In June 2016 we entered into a development agreement with
an unnamed company in the oil and natural gas sector to produce novel technology for use in that industry. To date, we have not
entered into any formal commercial supply agreements, joint ventures, or licensing agreements.  

These
collaborations will support our internal research and development activities which will continue to be a primary part our business.
Our principal revenue streams are expected to come from (i) sales of quantum dots and other nanomaterials, (ii) royalties from
sales of products and components by third parties incorporating the Company s products, (iii) milestone payments under joint
development arrangements with product developers and manufacturers, and (iv) sublicensing fees where we engage in sublicensing
arrangements for its owned and/or licensed technology.  

Our
ongoing research and development functions are considered key to maintaining and enhancing its competitive position in the growing
nanomaterials and quantum dot market. Nanomaterial and quantum dot technology continues to evolve, with new discoveries and refinements
being made on an ongoing basis. We intend to be at the forefront of technological development, and intend to focus a significant
part of our efforts on this, as we have done historically. Continuing R D activities at the San Marcos facility and our collaboration
with Texas State University, Rice, UA, and the numerous other research centers and departments with which we have relationships
will be important aspects of our strategy.  

Solterra
plans to utilize QMC s patented low-cost, high-volume quantum dot production combined with TQD technology licensed from
Rice to commercialize quantum dot solar cells at a cost that is competitive with conventional fossil fuel generation on an unsubsidized
basis.  

Our
business is subject to various types of government regulations, including restrictions on the chemical composition of nanomaterials
used in life sciences and other sensitive applications, and regulation of hazardous materials used in or produced by the manufacture
or use of QDs. Management believes the patented (owned and licensed) processes and proprietary manufacturing equipment employed
allow us to comply with current regulations. However, new regulations or requirements may develop which could adversely affect
the Company or its products in the future.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016 we had a working capital deficit of $1,351,404, with total current assets and liabilities of $114,112 and
$1,465,516, respectively. Included in the liabilities are $296,050 that is owed to our officers, directors and employees for services
rendered and accrued through September 30, 2016, $74,083 of convertible debentures, net of unamortized discount and $92,936 of
notes payable, net of unamortized discount, that are due within one year. As a result, we have relied on financing through the
issuance of common stock and convertible debentures.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we have cash and cash equivalent assets of $26,694 and continue to incur losses in operations. Over the
past five years we have primarily relied on sales of common stock and debt instruments to support operations as well as employees
and consultants agreeing to defer payment of wages and fees owed to them and/or converting such wages and fees into securities
of the Company. Management believes it may be necessary for the Company to rely on external financing to supplement working capital
in order to meet the Company s liquidity needs in fiscal year 2017 and 2018; the success of securing such financing on terms
acceptable to the Company cannot be assured. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations,
our stockholders may lose their entire investment in the Company.  

The
following table summarizes the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:  

Operating
Activities:  Net cash used in operating activities was $621,195 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $239,425
for the same period of 2015, a decrease of $381,770. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in deferred revenue.  

Investing
Activities:  Net cash used in investing activities was $19,096 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net
cash provided by investing activities of $30,181 for the same period of 2015, a net decrease in cash of $49,277. The decrease
is primarily the result of receipt of restricted cash investment in the three months ended September 30, 2015, offset by fewer
purchases of property and equipment during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Financing
Activities:  Net cash provided by financing activities was $400,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $78,000 for the same period of 2015, an increase of $322,000. The increase is due to proceeds received from convertible debentures
and notes payable.  

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to
a going concern, which assumes we will be able to meet our obligations and continue our operations for the next fiscal year. Realization
values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these consolidated financial statements do not give effect
to adjustments that would be necessary to reflect the carrying value and classification of assets and liabilities should we be
unable to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, we had not yet achieved profitable operations, had a working
capital deficit of $1,351,404 and expect to incur further losses in the development of the business, all of which casts substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. We continue to explore available financing options, including, without limitation, the sale of equity, debt borrowing and/or
the receipt of product licensing fees and royalties. We can provide no assurances that future financing, if needed, will be obtained
on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. In this respect, see Note 1 in our notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements
for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a going concern.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

General
and administrative expenses   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred $1,187,801 of general and administrative expenses, an increase
of $289,907 from the $897,894 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to increases in compensation and legal and audit expenses.  

Included
in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was compensation of $421,201, legal and audit
fees of $262,620, other professional fees of $97,460, travel expense of $8,874, corporate expense of $139,872 and stock-based
compensation of $225,122. Included in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was compensation
of $262,649, legal and audit fees of $135,006, other professional fees of $128,001, travel expense of $25,841, corporate expense
of $84,946 and stock-based compensation of $231,405.  

Research
and development expenses   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred $145,459 of research and development expenses, an increase of $55,128
from the $90,331 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to increased expenditures
for lab equipment, chemicals and consumables in the San Marcos facility.  

Beneficial
conversion feature on convertible debenture   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred $69,917 of beneficial conversion expense compared to $0 recorded
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company did not enter into
any convertible debenture agreements, whereas in the three months ended September 30, 2016, the company entered into convertible
debenture agreements that contained beneficial conversion features. See Note 5.  

Interest
expense   

Interest
expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $65,165 compared to $11,105 in the three months ended September
30, 2015.  

Interest
expense recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily related to the 8% interest associated with the $500,000
convertible debentures issued in January 2015 and the 8% interest and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the
$1,565,000 convertible debentures issued during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Interest
expense recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015 relates to the 8% interest associated with the $500,000 convertible
debentures issued in January 2015 and the 6% interest associated with the $25,050 convertible debenture issued in September 2014.  

Accretion
of debt discount   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded $113,288 of accretion of debt discount expense, an increase of
$71,101 from the $42,187 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Accretion
of debt discount expense recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily related to the discount recorded on
the $500,000 convertible debentures issued in January 2015 and the discount recorded on the $1,565,000 convertible debentures
issued during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Accretion
of debt discount expense recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015 is related to the discount recorded on the $500,000
convertible debentures issued in January 2015.  

The
following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:  

Off-balance
sheet arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk
support and credit risk support or other benefits.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Not
applicable.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on their evaluation, our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at September 30, 2016.  

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute
assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls
and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.
