proved developed reserves     Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. 

proved reser  ves    Those reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.  The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced, or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project, within a reasonable time. 

The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes all of the following: 

a. 

The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and     

b. 

Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.     

Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when both of the following occur: 

a. 

Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based, and     

b. 

The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.

Table of Contents  

Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.  The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

reasonable certainty    If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.  If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.  A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical and geochemical) engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery with time, reasonably certain estimated ultimate recovery is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. 

reserves    Estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.  In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectati  on that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

reservoir    A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

royalty    The amount or fee paid to the owner of mineral rights, expressed as a percentage or fraction of gross income from crude oil or natural gas produced and sold, unencumbered by expenses relating to the drilling, completing or operating of the affected well. 

SEC      The United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 

working interest    The interest in a crude oil and natural gas property (normally a leasehold interest) that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operations on the property and   to   a share of production, subject to all royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens and to all costs of   exploration, development and operations and all risks in connection therewith. 

workover    Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.

1.           BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Description of Operations   Whiting Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and gas company   engaged in the development, acquisition  ,     exploration   and production of   crude oil, NGLs and natural gas primarily in the Rocky Mountain  s   region of the United States.  Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to  Whiting  or the  Company  are to Whiting Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries  , Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation ( Whiting Oil and Gas ), Whiting US Holding Company, Whiting Canadian Holding Company ULC (formerly Kodiak Oil   Gas Corp.,  Kodiak ), Whiting Resources Corporation (formerly Kodiak Oil   Gas (USA) Inc.) and Whiting Programs, Inc  . 

Consolidated Financial Statements   The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Whiting Petroleum Corporation   and   its consolidated subsidiaries  .    Investments in entities which give Whiting significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method.  Under the equity method, investments are stated at cost plus the Company s equity in undistributed earnings and losses.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP   and the SEC rules and regulations   for interim financial reporting.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s interim results.  However, operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.    The consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   should be read in conjunction with Whiting s consolidated financial statements and related note  s included in the Company s   Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the period ended December 31, 2015  .  Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes to the information disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in   the Company s   201  5   Annual Report on Form 10   K. 

Earnings Per Share   Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, which includes the effect of potentially dilutive securities.  Potentially dilutive securities for the diluted earnings per share calculations consist of   (i)   convertible debt to be   settled   in shares  ,   using the if-converted method   and (ii)     unvested restricted stock awards  ,   outstanding stock options   and   contingently issuable shares of convertible debt   to be settled in cash  , all   using the treasury stock method  .        When a loss from continuing operations exists, all   dilutive securities and   potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. 

Adopted and Recently Issued   Accounting Pronouncements   In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Improvements To Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).  The objective of this ASU is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Portions of this ASU must be applied prospectively while other portions may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU 2016   09. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  The objective of this ASU is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU 2016   02. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014   09 ).  The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  The FASB subsequently issued ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 and provided additional implementation guidance.  These ASUs are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 31, 2017.  The standards permit retrospective application using either of the following methodologies: (i) restatement of each prior reporting period presented or (ii) recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of initial application.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these standards on its consolidated financial statements, as well as the transition method to be applied.

2.           OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES 

Net capitalized costs related to the Company s oil and gas producing activities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

3.               ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 

2016 Acquisitions and Divestitures 

In July 2016, the Company completed the sale of its interest in its enhanced oil recovery project in the North Ward Estes field in Ward and Winkler counties of Texas, including Whiting s interest in certain CO  2   properties in the McElmo Dome field in Colorado,   two   contracts for the supply and delivery of CO  2  , and certain other related assets and liabilities (the  North Ward Estes Properties )     for a cash purchase price of   $300   million (before closing adjustments)  .  The sale was effective July 1, 2016 and resulted   in a pre-tax loss on sale of   $  188   million  .        The Company used the net proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under its credit agreement. 

In addition to the cash purchase price, the buyer has agreed to pay Whiting   $100,000   for every $0.01 that, as of June 28, 2018, the average NYMEX crude oil futures contract price for each month from August 2018 through July 2021 is above   $50.00/Bbl   up to a maximum amount of   $100   million (the  Contingent Payment ).  The Contingent Payment will be made at the option of the buyer either in cash on July 31, 2018 or in the form of a secured promissory note, accruing interest at   8%   per annum with a maturity date of July 29, 2022.    The Company has determined that this Contingent Payment is an embedded derivative and has reflected it at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  The fair value of the Contingent Payment as of the closing date of this sale transaction was   $39   million.  Refer to the  Derivative Financial Instruments  and  Fair Value Measurements  footnotes for more information on this embedded derivative   instrument  . 

There were no significant acquisitions during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016. 

2015 Acquisitions and Divestitures 

In December 2015, the Company completed the sale of a fresh water delivery system, a produced water gathering system and four saltwater disposal wells located in Weld County, Colorado, effective December 16, 2015, for   aggregate sales proceeds   of   $75   million (before closing adjustments). 

In June 2015, the Company completed the sale of its interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells, effective June 1, 2015, for   aggregate sales proceeds   of   $150   million (before closing adjustments) resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of   $118   million.  The properties included over   2,000   gross wells in   132   fields across   10   states. 

In April 2015, the Company completed the sale of its interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells, effective May 1, 2015, for   aggregate sales proceeds   of   $108   million (before closing adjustments) resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of   $29   million.  The properties are located in   187   fields across   14   states, and predominately consist of assets that were previously included in the underlying properties of Whiting USA Trust I. 

Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company completed several immaterial divestiture transactions for the sale of its interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells and undeveloped acreage, for   aggregate sales proceeds   of   $176   million (before closing adjustments) resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of   $28   million. 

There were no significant acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.

4  .           LONG-TERM DEBT 

Long-term debt consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

Credit Agreement   Whiting Oil and Gas, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, has a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that as of   September 30, 2016   had a borrowing base of   $2.6   billion, with aggregate commitments of   $2.5   billion.    Upon closing of the sale of the North Ward Estes Properties on July 27, 2016, the borrowing base was reduced from   $2.75   billion to $2.6 billion.  In October 2016,   the borrowing base under the facility was reduced to   $2.5   billion   in connection with the November 1, 2016 regular borrowing base redetermination  ,   with no change to the aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion.    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1.8   billion of available borrowing capacity, which was net of     $650   million in borrowings and     $11   million in letters of credit outstanding. 

The borrowing base under the credit agreement is determined at the discretion of the lenders, based on the collateral value of the Company s proved reserves that have been mortgaged to such lenders, and is subject to regular redeterminations on May 1 and November 1 of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement, in each case which may reduce the amount of the borrowing base.  Upon a redetermination of the borrowing base, either on a periodic or special redetermination date, if borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing capacity were outstanding, the Company could be forced to immediately repay a portion of its debt outstanding under the credit agreement.    The credit agreement permits the Company to dispose of   its   ownership interests in certain gas gathering and processing plants located in North Dakota without reducing the borrowing base. 

A portion of the revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed   $50   million may be used to issue letters of credit for the account of Whiting Oil and Gas or other designated subsidiaries of the Company.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,    $39   million was available for additional letters of credit under the agreement. 

The credit agreement provides for interest only payments until December 2019, when the credit agreement expires and all outstanding borrowings are due.  Interest under the revolving credit facility accrues at the Company s option at either (i) a base rate for a base rate loan plus the margin in the table below, where the base rate is defined as the greatest of the prime rate, the   federal funds   rate plus   0.5%   per annum, or an adjusted   LIBOR   rate plus   1.0%   per annum, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a Eurodollar loan plus the margin in the table below.  Additionally, the Company also incurs commitment fees as set forth in the table below on the unused portion of the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the revolving credit facility, which are included as a component of interest expense.        At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement   was   2.9%   and   1.9%  , respectively  .

Under the credit agreement, the  Interim Covenant Period  is defined as the period from June 30, 2015 until the earlier of (a) April 1, 2018 or (b) the commencement of an investment-grade debt rating period   (as defined in the credit agreement)  .  The Company was in compliance with its covenants under the credit agreement as of   September 30, 2016  .

last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the   five   business day period after any   five   consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per   $1,000   principal amount of the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the measurement period is less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.  On or after January 1, 2020, the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the April 1, 2020 maturity date of the notes.

Upon issuance, the Company separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes.  The liability component was recorded at the estimated fair value of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature.  The difference between the principal amount of the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded as a debt discount and   is being   amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method, with an effective interest rate of   5.6%   per annum.  The fair value of the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes as of the issuance date was estimated at   $1.0   billion, resulting in a debt discount at inception of   $238   million.  The equity component, representing the value of the conversion option, was computed by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds of the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes issuance.  This equity component was recorded, net of deferred taxes and issuance costs, in additional paid-in capital within shareholders  equity, and will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.    

Transaction costs related to the   2020   Convertible Senior Notes issuance were allocated to the liability and equity components based on their relative fair values.  Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were recorded   as a reduction to the carrying value of long-term   debt on the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method.  Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were recorded as a charge to additional paid-in capital within shareholders  equity.

The Senior Notes,   the   2  020 Convertible Senior Notes  , the 2019 Mandatory Convertible Notes, the 2020 Mandatory Convertible Notes, the 2021 Mandatory Convertible Notes and the 2023 Mandatory Convertible Notes (collectively, the  Whiting Senior Notes )   a  re unsecured obligations of Whiting Petroleum Corporation and these unsecured obligations are subordinated to all of the Company s secured indebtedness, which consists of Whiting Oil and Gas  credit agreement.  The 2018 Senior Subordinated Notes   and the 2018 Mandatory Convertible Notes   are also unsecured obligations of Whiting Petroleum Corporation and are subordinated to all of the Company s senior debt, which currently consists of the Whiting Senior Notes and   borrowings under   Whiting Oil and Gas  credit agreement. 

The Company s obligations under   the Whiting Senior Notes,   the 2018 Senior Subordinated Note  s and the 2018 Mandatory Convertible Notes   are guaranteed by the Company s   100%  -owned subsidiaries, Whiting Oil and Gas, Whiting US Holding Company, Whiting Canadian Holding Company ULC and Whiting Resources Corporation (the  Guarantors ).  These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several among the Guarantors.  Any subsidiaries other than these Guarantors are minor subsidiaries as defined by Rule 3-10(h)(6) of Regulation S   X of the SEC.  Whiting Petroleum Corporation has no assets or operations independent of this debt and its investments in its consolidated subsidiaries. 

5  .           ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 

The Company s asset retirement obligations represent the present value of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells, removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and land restoration (including removal of certain onshore and offshore facilities in California) in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws.  The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 410,   Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations  , to determine its asset retirement obligation amounts by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash outflows associated with its plug and abandonment obligations.  The current portions at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $7   million and   $6   million, respectively, and have been included in accrued liabilities and other.  Revisions to the liability typically occur due to changes in estimated abandonment costs or well economic lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding the abandonment of wells.  The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company s asset retirement obligations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

6  .           DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, and   it     uses derivative instruments to manage its commodity price risk.    In addition, the Company   periodically enters into contracts   that contain embedded   features   which   are   required to be   bifurcated and   accounted for   separately   as derivatives.    Whiting follows FASB ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , to account for its derivative financial instruments. 

Commodity Derivative Contracts     Historically, prices received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile because of supply and demand factors, worldwide political factors, general economic conditions and seasonal weather patterns.  Whiting enters into derivative contracts such as costless collars  , swaps   and crude oil sales and delivery contracts to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing its exposure to commodity price volatility.  Commodity derivative contracts are thereby used to ensure adequate cash flow to fund the Company s capital programs and to manage returns on drilling programs     and     acquisitions.  The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes.  

Crude Oil Costless Collars.    Costless collars are designed to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated future oil or gas production.  While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. 

The table below details the Company s costless collar derivatives entered into to hedge forecasted crude oil production revenues as of   October   1  , 2016  . 

(1) 

A three-way collar is a combination of options: a sold call, a purchased put and a sold put.  The sold call establishes a maximum price (ceiling) Whiting will receive for the volumes under contract.  The purchased put establishes a minimum price (floor), unless the market price falls below the sold put (sub-floor), at which point the minimum price would be NYMEX plus the difference between the purchased put and the sold put strike price.     

Crude Oil Sales and Delivery Contract.    The Company has a long-term crude oil sales and delivery contract for oil volumes produced from its Redtail field in Colorado.  Under the terms of the agreement, Whiting has committed to deliver certain fixed volumes of crude oil through 2020.  The Company determined that it was not probable that future oil production from its Redtail field would be sufficient to meet the minimum volume requirement  s   specified in this contract, and accordingly, that the Company would not settle this contract through physical delivery of crude oil volumes.  As a result, Whiting determined that this contract would not qualify for the  normal purchase normal sale  exclusion and has therefore reflected the contract at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of this derivative contract was a liability of   $  10   million. 

Embedded   Derivative  s     In March 2016, the   Company   issued     convertible notes that contain  ed   debtholder conversion options which the Company determined were not clearly and closely related to the debt host contracts, and the Company therefore bifurcated these embedded features and reflected them at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.    During the second quarter of   2016,     the entire aggregate principal amount of these notes   was   converted into shares of the Company s common stock, and     t  he fair value of these embedded derivatives   as of September 30, 2016   was   therefore     zero  .

Table of Contents  

In   July 2016, the Company   entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the buyer of its North Ward Estes Properties, whereby the buyer has agreed to pay Whiting additional proceeds of   $100,000     for every $0.01 that, as of June 28, 2018, the average NYMEX crude oil futures contract price for each month from August 2018 through July 2021 is above   $50.00/Bbl   up to a maximum amount of   $100   million.  The Company has determined that this NYMEX-linked Contingent Payment is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and the Company therefore bifurcated this embedded feature and reflected it     at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  As of September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of this embedded derivative was an asset of $47 million. 

Derivative Instrument Reporting     All derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, other than derivative instruments that meet the  normal purchase normal sale  exclusion   or other derivative scope exceptions  .  The following table  s   summarize the effects of derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of   operations   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands): 

Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities.    The Company nets its financial derivative instrument fair value amounts executed with the same counterparty pursuant to ISDA master agreements, which pr  ovide for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract.  The following tables summarize the location and fair value amounts of all   the Company s   derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as the gross recognized derivative assets, liabilities and amounts offset in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):

Because counterparties to the Company s financial derivative contracts   subject to master netting arrangements   are lenders under Whiting Oil and Gas  credit agreement, which eliminates its need to post or receive collateral associated with its derivative positions, columns for cash collateral pledged or received have not been presented in the  se   tables.     

Contingent Features in Financial Derivative Instruments  .    None of the Company s derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.  Counterparties to the Company s financial derivative contracts are high credit-quality financial institutions that are lenders under Whiting s credit agreement.  The Company uses only credit agreement participants to hedge with, since these institutions are secured equally with the holders of Whiting s bank debt, which eliminates the potential need to post collateral when Whiting is in a derivative liability position.  As a result, the Company is not required to post letters of credit or corporate guarantees for its derivative counterparties in order to secure contract performance obligations. 

7  .           FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure  , which   establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements.  The valuation hierarchy   categorizes   assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.  The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1:      Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.     

Level 2:  Significant Other Observable Inputs   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.     

Level 3:  Significant Unobservable Inputs   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.     

A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  The Company reflects transfers between the three levels at the beginning of the reporting period in which the availability of observable inputs no longer justifies classification in the original level. 

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  The Company s credit agreement has a recorded value that approximates its fair value since its variable interest rate is tied to current market rates. 

The Company s   senior n  otes   and     senior subordinated n  otes     are recorded at cost  , and the Company s convertible senior notes and convertible senior subordinated notes are recorded at fair value at the date of issuance  .    The following table summarizes the fair values and carrying values of these instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

19   

Table of Contents  

(1) 

Fair values are based on quoted market prices for these debt securities, and such fair values are therefore designated as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy.     

(2) 

Fair value is determined using a binomial lattice model which considers various inputs including (i) Whiting s common stock price, (ii) risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury rates, (iii) recovery rates in the event of default, (iv) default intensity, and (v) volatility of Whiting s common stock.  The expected volatility and default intensity used in the valuation are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation methodology, and such fair value is therefore designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.     

(3) 

Carrying values are presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts or premiums, including discounts related to the beneficial conversion features associated with the Mandatory Convertible Notes.     

The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and include a measure of the Company s own nonperformance risk or that of its counterpart  y  , as appropriate.        The following tables present information about the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair values (in thousands): 

20   

Table of Contents  

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis: 

Commodity Derivatives  .    Commodity derivative instruments consist mainly of costless collars for crude oil.  The Company s costless collars are valued based on an income approach.    T  he option model consider  s   various assumptions, such as quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and volatility factors.  These assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the contract, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace, and are therefore designated as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.  The discount rates used in the fair values of these instruments include a measure of either the Company s or the counterparty s nonperformance risk, as appropriate.    The Company utilizes its counterparties  valuations to assess the reasonableness of its own valuations. 

In addition, the Company has a   long-term crude oil sales   and delivery contract, whereby it has committed to deliver certain fixed volumes of crude oil through 2020.        Whiting has determined that the contract   does   not meet the  normal purchase normal sale  exclusion, and has therefore reflected this contract at fair value in its consolidated financial statements.    This commodity derivative was valued based on an income approach which considers various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, market differentials for crude oil, U.S. Treasury rates and either the Company s or the counterparty s nonperformance risk, as appropriate.        The assumptions used in the valuation of the crude oil sales and delivery     contract include certain market differential metrics that were unobservable during the term of the contract.    Such unobservable inputs were significant to the contract valuation methodology, and the   contract s   fair value was therefore designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. 

Embedded Derivatives  .  The   Company had   em  bedded derivatives related to its convertible notes that were issued in March 2016.  The notes contained debtholder conversion options which the Company determined were not clearly and closely related   to the debt host contracts and the Company therefore bifurcated these embedded features and reflected them at fair value in the consolidated financial statements  .  Prior to their settlements, the fair values of these embedded derivatives were determined using a binomial lattice model which considered various inputs including (i) Whiting s common stock price, (ii) risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury rates, (iii) recovery rates in the event of default, (iv) default intensity, and (v) volatility of Whiting s common stock.  The expected volatility and default intensity used in the valuation were unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation methodology, and the embedded derivatives  fair value was therefore designated as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy.  During the second quarter of 2016, the entire aggregate principal amount of these convertible notes was converted into shares of the Company s common stock, and these embedded derivatives were thereby settled in their entirety as of June 30, 2016. 

The Company has an embedded derivative   related to its purchase and sale agreement with the buyer of the North Ward Estes Properties.  The agreement includes a Contingent Payment linked to NYMEX crude oil prices which the Company has determined is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and the Company therefore bifurcated this embedded feature   and reflected   it   at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  The fair value of this embedded derivative   was   determined using a   modified Black-Scholes   swaption pricing model which considers various assumptions,   including   quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and volatility factors.  These assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the financial instrument  , can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace, and are therefore designated as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The discount rate used in the fair value of this instrument includes a measure of the counterparty s nonperformance risk.       

Level 3 Fair Value Measurements     A third-party valuation specialist is utilized to determine the fair value of the   Company s     derivative   instruments designated as Level 3.  The Company reviews these valuations  ,   including the related model inputs and assumptions  ,   and analyzes changes in fair value measurements between periods.  The Company corroborates such inputs, calculations and fair value changes using various methodologies, and reviews unobservable inputs for reasonableness utilizing relevant information from other published sources.

Sensitivity to Changes In Significant Unobservable Inputs.        As presented above, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Whiting s commodity derivative contract are the market differentials for crude oil over the term of the contract.  Significant increases or decreases in these unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower, respectively, fair value liability measurement. 

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements     The Company applies the provisions of the fair value measurement standard on a non-recurring basis to its non-financial assets and liabilities, including proved property   and goodwill  .  These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances.        The Company did not recognize any impairment write-downs with respect to its proved property or goodwill during the 2016 reporting periods presented.  The following table presents information about the Company s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2015, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value (in thousands):

During the third quarter of 2015, proved oil and gas properties with a previous carrying amount of   $2.1   billion were written down to their fair value as of September 30, 2015 of   $531   million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of   $1.5   billion which was recorded within exploration and impairment expense.  The impaired properties consisted of the Company s North Ward Estes field in Texas and other non-core proved oil and gas properties primarily in Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota and Colorado that were not being developed due to depressed oil and gas prices.  Also during the third quarter of 2015, proved CO  2   properties at the Bravo Dome field in New Mexico and the McElmo Dome field in Colorado with a previous carrying amount of   $63   million were written down to their fair value as of September 30, 2015 of   $1   million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of   $62   million which was also recorded within exploration and impairment expense.

During the third quarter of 2015, goodwill related to the acquisition of Kodiak with a previous carrying amount of   $870   million was written down to its fair value of   zero  , resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $870 million which was recorded as a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations.     

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the non-financial assets in the table above: 

Proved Property Impairments  .  The Company tests proved property for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets may be reduced below their carrying value.  As a result of the significant decrease in the forward price curves for crude oil and natural gas during the third quarter of 2015, and the associated decline in oil and gas reserves over that same period, the Company performed a proved property impairment test as of September 30, 2015.  The fair value was ascribed using income approach analyses based on the net discounted future cash flows from the producing property and a market approach analysis, which approaches have been probability-weighted.  The discounted cash flows were based on management s expectations for the future.  Unobservable inputs included estimates of future oil and gas or CO  2   production, as the case may be, from the Company s reserve reports, commodity prices based on sales contract terms or forward price curves (adjusted for basis differentials), operating and development costs, and a discount rate based on the Company s weighted-average cost of capital (all of which were designated as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy).  The impairment test indicated that a proved property impairment had occurred, and the Company therefore recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the impaired property to its fair value at the measurement date. 

Goodwill Impairment.    The Company tested goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the fair value of its reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value.  The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2015, and determined that no impairment had occurred.  However, as a result of a sustained decrease in the price of Whiting s common stock during the third quarter of 2015 caused by a significant decline in crude oil and natural gas prices over that same period, the Company performed another goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.  The fair value of the Company s reporting unit was ascribed using an income approach analysis based on the Company s net discounted future cash flows and a market approach analysis.  The discounted cash flows were based on management s expectations for the future.  Unobservable inputs included estimates of future oil and gas production from the Company s reserve reports, commodity prices based on sales contract terms or forward price curves (adjusted for basis differentials), operating and development costs, and a discount rate based on the Company s weighted-average cost of capital (all of which were designated as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy).  The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the fair value of its reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, and further that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to goodwill.  Based on these results, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to   zero  . 

8  .           SHAREHOLDERS      EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 

Common Stock     In May 2016, Whiting s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from   300,000,000   to   600,000,000   shares.  

Common Stock Offering  .        In March 2015, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock, selling   35,000,000   shares of common stock at a price of   $30.00   per share and providing net proceeds of approximately   $1.0   billion after underwriter s fees.  In addition, the Company granted the underwriter a   30  -day option to purchase up to an additional   5,250,000   shares of common stock.    On April 1, 2015, the underwriter exercised its right to purchase an additional   2,000,000   shares of common stock, providing additional net proceeds of   $61   million. 

Equity Incentive Plan   At the Company s 2013 Annual Meeting held on May 7, 2013, shareholders approved the Whiting Petroleum Corporation 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2013 Equity Plan ), which replaced the Whiting Petroleum Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2003 Equity Plan )     and include  d   the authority to issue   5,300,000   shares of the Company s common stock.        Upon shareholder approval of the 2013 Equity Plan, the 2003 Equity Plan was terminated.  The 2003 Equity Plan continues to govern awards that were outstanding as of the date of its termination, which remain in effect pursuant to their terms.      Any shares netted or forfeited after May 7, 2013 under the 2003 Equity Plan   and any shares forfeited under the 2013 Equity Plan   will be available for future issuance under the 2013 Equity Plan.    However, shares netted for tax withholding under the 2013 Equity Plan will be cancelled and will not be available for future issuance.    On December 8, 2014, the Company increased the number of shares issuable   under the 2013 Equity Plan by   978,161   shares to accommodate for the conversion of Kodiak s outstanding equity awards to Whiting equity awards upon closing of the Kodiak Acquisition.  Any shares netted or forfeited under this increased availability will be cancelled and will not be available for future issuance under the 2013 Equity Plan.    At the Company s 2016 Annual Meeting held on May 17, 2016, shareholders approved an amendment   and restatement of   the 2013 Equity Plan which increased the total number of shares issuable under the plan by   5,500,000   and revised certain award limits for employees and non-employee directors.    Under the   amended   and restated   2013 Equity Plan  ,    no employee or officer participant may be granted options for more than   9  00,000   shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights relating to more than   9  00,000   shares of common stock, or more than   6  00,000   shares of restricted stock during any calendar year.    In addition, no non-employee director participant may be granted options for more than   100,000   shares of

common stock,   stock appreciation rights relating to more than   100,000   shares of common stock, or more than   100,000   shares of restricted stock during any calendar year.        As of   September 30, 2016  ,    6,222,650   shares of common stock remained available for grant under the   amended   2013 Equity Plan. 

Noncontrolling Interest   The Company s noncontrolling interest represents an unrelated third party s   25%   ownership interest in Sustainable Water Resources, LLC.  The     table below summarizes the activity for the equity attributable to the noncontrolling interest (in thousands): 

9  .         INCOME TAXES 

Income tax expense during interim periods is based on applying an estimated annual effective income tax rate to year-to-date income, plus any significant unusual or infrequently occurring items which are recorded in the interim period.  The provision for income taxes for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   differs from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of   35%   to pre-tax income primarily because of state income taxes and estimated permanent differences.    In addition, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company s note exchange transactions   triggered   an ownership shift   as defined   under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code   due to the  deemed share issuance  that resulted from the note   exchanges.  This triggering even  t    will limit the Company s usage of certain of its net operating losses and tax credits in the future.  Accordingly, the Company recognized a write-down of deferred tax assets totaling   $315   million and recorded a valuation allowance on its net operating losses of   $139   million during the third quarter of 2016, resulting in a total non-cash charge of   $454   million.  The Company expects to record an additional valuation allowance of approximately   $14   million in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total non-cash charge related to the Section 382 limitation to approximately   $468   million. 

The computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and significant judgment including, but not limited to, the expected operating income for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in various jurisdictions, permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year.  The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional information becomes known or as the tax environment changes.

Table of Contents  

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company had a net loss and therefore the diluted earnings per share calculation for that period excludes the anti-dilutive effect   of   (i)   81,  549,680   shares issuable upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes  , (ii) 1,240,145   shares of service-based restricted stock   and (iii) 4,448 stock options.  In addition, the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 excludes the dilutive effect of 2,090,383 common shares for stock options that were out-of-the-money and 897,005 shares of restricted stock that did not meet its market-based vesting criteria as of September 30, 2016. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net loss and therefore the diluted earnings per share calculation for that period excludes the anti-dilutive effect of 94,513 shares of   service-based   restricted stock and 59,320 stock options.  In addition, the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2015 excludes (i) the anti-dilutive effect of 359,270 incremental shares of restricted stock that did not meet its market-based vesting criteria as of September 30, 2015 and (ii) the dilutive effect of 712,778 common shares for stock options that were out-of-the-money. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss and therefore the diluted earnings per share calculation for that period excludes the anti-dilutive effect of (i)     27,478,601   shares issuable upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes,     (ii) 1,351,434 shares of service-based restricted stock     and (iii) 4,573 stock options.  In addition, the diluted earnings per share calculation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 excludes the dilutive effect of     2,065,797   common shares for stock options that were out-of-the-money   and     523,351   shares of restricted stock that did not meet its market-based vesting criteria as of   September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net loss and therefore the diluted earnings per share calculation for that period excludes the anti-dilutive effect of   442,713   shares of   service-based   restricted stock and   94,434   stock options.  In addition, the diluted earnings per share calculation for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 excludes (i) the anti-dilutive effect of   644,233   incremental shares of restricted stock that did not meet its market-based vesting criteria as of September 30, 2015 and (ii) the dilutive effect of   405,065   common shares for stock options that were out-of-the-money. 

As discussed in the  Long-Term Debt  footnote, the Company has the option to settle the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes with cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof upon conversion.    Based on the initial conversion   price  , the   entire outstanding   principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes as of   September 30  , 2016 would be convertible into approximately   21.9   million shares of the Company s common stock.  However,   t  he Company s intent is to settle the principal amount of the   notes   in cash upon conversion.  As a result, only the amount by which the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the notes (the  conversion spread ) is considered in the diluted earnings per share computation under the treasury stock method.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the conversion value did not exceed the principal amount of the notes, and accordingly, there was no impact to diluted earnings per share or the related disclosures for th  ose   period  s  . 

11.             COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company terminated two ship-or-pay agreements   with the same   counterparty   that expired in 2026, and incurred termination penalties totaling $1 million.  Under the original agreements, the Company had committed to transport a minimum daily volume of crude oil or water, as the case may be, via certain pipelines or else pay for any deficiencies at prices stipulated in the contracts.  The termination of these agreements reduced the Company s future commitments under this agreement by approximately   $67   million as of June 30, 2016. 

As discussed in the    Acquisitions and Divestitures    footnote, the Company sold its interest in the North Ward Estes field in Texas on July 2  7  , 2016.  In conjunction with this sale, the Company transferred to the buyer of the properties (i) a take-or-pay purchase agreement that expires in 2017 to buy certain volumes of CO  2   for use in the North Ward Estes EOR project, and (ii) a ship-or-pay agreement that expires in 2017 to transport a minimum daily volume of CO  2   via certain pipelines.  The transfer of these agreements reduced the Company s future commitments under these contracts by approximately   $51   million     as of   the   Ju  ly     1  , 2016   effective date of the sale  . 

1  2  .          SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

In October 2016,   the borrowing base under   Whiting Oil and Gas    credit agreement was reduced from   $2.6   billion to   $2.5   billion   in connection with the November 1, 2016 regular borrowing base redetermination  ,   with no change to the aggregate commitments of   $2.5   billion.  All other terms of the credit agreement remain unchanged.

Overview 

We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in development, production  ,   acquisition and   exploration   activities primarily in the Rocky Mountain  s   region of the United States.  Since 2006, we have   increased our   focus on organic drilling activity and on the development of previously acquired properties, specifically on projects that we believe provide the opportunity for repeatable success and production growth  , while selectively pursuing acquisitions that complement our existing core properties  .    As a result of sustained lower crude oil prices in 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, we have significantly reduced our level of capital spending to more closely align with our cash flows generated from operations, and have focused our drilling activity on projects that provide the highest rate of return.  In addition, w  e continually evaluate our property portfolio and sell properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own  , such as the sale of our North Ward Estes properties in July 2016 discussed below under  Acquisition and Divestiture Highlights  and the other asset sales in 2015 discussed in the  Acquisitions and Divestitures  footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Our revenue, profitability and future growth rate depend on many factors which are beyond our control, such as   oil and gas prices as well as   economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy  , as well as other items discussed under the caption  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  .  Oil and gas prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future.    The following table highlights the quarterly average NYMEX price trends for crude oil and natural gas prices since the first quarter of 201  4  : 

Oil prices have fallen significantly since reaching highs of over $105.00 per Bbl in June 2014, dropping below $  27  .00 per Bbl in   February 2016  .  Natural gas prices have also declined from over $4.80 per Mcf in April 2014 to below $  1  .  70   per Mcf in   March 2016  .    Although oil and natural gas prices have begun to recover from the lows experienced during the first quarter of 2016, forecasted prices for both oil and gas remain low.    Lower oil  , NGL   and natural gas prices may not only decr  ease our revenues, but may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and therefore potentiall  y lower our oil and gas reserve quantities  .    S  ubstantial   and   extended decline  s   in oil  , NGL     and   natural gas prices   have resulted and   may   continue to   result in impairments of our proved oil and gas properties   or undeveloped acreage   and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.    In addition,   l  ower   commodity   prices   have reduced, and may further reduce,   the amount of our borrowing base under our   credit agreement   (such as the reduction discussed below under  Financing Highlights )  , which is determined at the discretion of the lenders and is based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to the lenders.  Upon a redetermination, if borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing capacity were outstanding, we could be forced to immediately repay a portion of the debt outstanding under our credit agreement.    Alternatively  , higher oil prices may result in significant mark-to-market losses being incurred on our commodity-ba  sed derivatives. 

201  6   Highlights and Future Considerations 

Operational Highlights 

Williston Basin 

Our properties in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana target the Bakken and Three Forks formations.  Net production from the Williston Basin averaged 105.6 MBOE/d for the third quarter of 2016, which represents an 8% decrease from 114.4 MBOE/d in the second quarter of 2016.  In April and July 2016, we entered into two separate wellbore participation agreements related to the wells that we intend to drill in the Williston Basin during 2016, which will allow us to continue completion activity in this area.  As of September 30, 2016, we had three rigs active in the Williston Basin.  In October 2016, we moved an additional rig from our Redtail  

26   

Table of Contents  

field to this area  .      Across our acreage in the Williston Basin, we     have implemented new completion design  s which utilize   cemented liners, plug-and-perf technology  ,     significantly   higher sand volumes  , new diversion technology and   both hybrid and slickwater fracture stimulation methods  , which have resulted   in improved initial production rates. 

In order to process the produced gas stream from   our     wells in the   Sanish   field  , we constructed the Robinson Lake gas plant.  The plant has a current processing capacity of 130 MMcf/d and fractionation equipment that allows us to convert NGLs into propane and butane, which end products can then be sold locally for higher realized prices.    As of September 30, 2016, the plant was processing over 113 MMcf/d. 

We   also   hold a 50% ownership interest in a gas processing plant, gathering systems and related facilities located south of Belfield, North Dakota, which primarily processes production from   our   Pronghorn   field  .  There is currently inlet compression in place to process 35 MMcf/d  , and a  s of   September 30, 2016  , the plant was processing   over 20   MMcf/d. 

Denver Julesburg Basin 

Our Redtail field in the Denver Julesb  u  rg Basin ( DJ Basin ) in Weld County, Colorado targets the Niobrara   and Codell/Fort Hays   formation  s  .  In the   third   quarter of 201  6  , net production from the Redtail field averaged   10.9   MBOE/d, representing a  n     8  %    in  crease     from   10.2   MBOE/d in the   second   quarter of 201  6  .    We have established production in the Niobrara  A ,  B  and  C  zones and the Codell/Fort Hays formations.    Our development plan at Redtail currently includes drilling up to eight wells per spacing unit   in the   Niobrara  A   ,  B  and  C  zones and up to four wells per spacing unit in the Codell/Fort Hays formations.        Additionally, the Codell/Fort Hays formation is prospective throughout our acreage in the Redtail field, and we are currently evaluating that formation.  We have implemented a new wellbore configuration in this area, which significantly reduces drilling times.    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   two   drilling rig  s   operating in   the DJ Basin.  In October 2016, we   moved one of the rigs from this area to the Williston Basin  .  We suspended completion operations in this area beginning in the second quarter of 2016; however, we plan to resume completion activity in early 2017. 

In April 2014, we brought online the Redtail gas plant to process the associated gas produced from our wells in this area.    During the third quarter of 2015, t  he plant s inlet capacity   was expanded to     50   MMcf/d.    As of September 30, 2016, the plant was processing over 18 MMcf/d. 

Permian Basin 

On July 27, 2016, we sold our interest in the   North Ward Estes   field   located   in   Ward and Winkler counties in Texas   as discussed below under  Acquisition and Divestiture Highlights   . 

Financing   Highlights 

O  n March   23,   2016,   we     completed the exchange of     $477 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes, consisting of (i)   $49 million aggregate principal amount of   our   2018 Senior Subordinated Notes,   (ii)   $97 million aggregate principal amount of   our   2019 Senior Notes,   (iii)   $15  2   million aggregate principal amount of   our   2021 Senior Notes  ,   and   (iv)   $179 million aggregate principal amount of   our   2023 Senior Notes  ,   for   (i) $49   million aggregate principal amount of new 6.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018  , (ii) $97   million aggregate principal amount of   new 5  % Convertible Senior Notes due 2019  , (iii) $152   million aggregate p  rincipal amount of new 5.75  % Co  nvertible Senior Notes due 2021, and (iv) $179   million aggregate principal amount of new 6.25% Convertible Seni  or Notes due 2023 (together the  New Convertible Notes ).    During the second quarter of 2016, holders of the New Convertible Notes voluntarily converted all $477 million aggregate principal amount of the New Convertible Notes for approximately 41.8 million shares of our common stock.  Upon conversion, we paid $46 million in cash consisting of early conversion payments to the holders of the notes, as well as all accrued and unpaid interest on such notes. 

O  n    June 29, 2016 and July 1,   2016,   we     completed the exchange of     $  1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, convertible senior notes and senior subordinated notes consisting of (i)   $  26   million aggregate principal amount of   our     6.5%   Senior Subordinated Notes   due 2018  ,    (ii)   $  42   million aggregate principal amount of   our     5%   Senior Notes   due 2019  ,    (iii) $688 million aggregate principal amount of our   1.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2020  , (iv)   $  174   million aggregate principal amount of   our     5.75%   Senior Notes   due 2021,   and   (v)   $  163   million aggregate principal amount of   our     6.25%   Senior Notes   due 2023,   for   (i)   $  26   million aggregate principal amount of new   6.5%     Mandatory   Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018  , (ii)   $  42   million aggregate principal amount of   new   5%     Mandatory   Convertible Senior Notes due 2019  , (iii) $688 million aggregate principal amount of     new 1.25% Mandatory Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, (iv)   $  174   million aggregate p  rincipal amount of new   5.75%     Mandatory   Convertible Senior Notes due 2021  , and (v)   $  163   million aggregate principal amount of new   6.25%     Mandatory   Convertible Senior Notes due 2023     (together the    Mandatory   Convertible Notes )  .    During the initial 25 trading day observation period from June 23, 2016 through July 28, 2016, $333 million aggregate principal amount of the Mandatory Convertible Notes were converted into  

27   

Table of Contents  

approximately 33.2 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Notes.  Upon conversion, we paid $3 million in cash consisting of all accrued and unpaid interest on such notes. 

The July 1, 2016 note exchange transactions triggered an ownership shift as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to the  deemed share issuance  that resulted from the note exchanges.  This triggering event will limit our usage of certain of our net operating losses and tax credits in the future.  Accordingly, we recognized a write-down of deferred tax assets totaling $315 million and recorded a valuation allowance on our net operating losses of $139 million during the third quarter of 2016, resulting in a total non-cash charge of $454 million.  We expect to record an additional valuation allowance of approximately   $14   million in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total non-cash charge related to the Section 382 limitation to approximately   $468   million. 

U  pon closing of   the sale of the North Ward Estes field on July 27, 2016, as discussed below under  Acquisition and Divestiture Highlights   , the borrowing base under Whiting Oil and Gas  credit agreement   was reduced from $2.75 billion   to $2.6 billion.    In October 2016, the borrowing base under the facility was further reduced from $2.6 billion to $2.5 billion in connection with the November 1, 2016 regular borrowing base redetermination.  There were no changes to the $2.5 billion aggregate commitments under the facility or to any other terms of the credit agreement. 

On August 12,   2016, we completed the exchange of (i) $13 million aggregate principal amount of our   6.5%     Mandatory   Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018   which had a conversion price of $8.75 per share (equivalent to   114.29   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes) for shares of our common stock at an issuance price of $7.77 per share (equivalent to 128.69 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes) and (ii) $25 million aggregate principal amount of our   5%     Mandatory   Convertible Senior Notes due 2019   which had a conversion price of $8.79 per share (equivalent to   113.72   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes) for shares of our common stock at an issuance price of $7.80 per share (equivalent to 128.17 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes).  Upon acceptance of this inducement offer by the holders of the notes, such notes were immediately cancelled in exchange for approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock and we paid $1 million in cash consisting of all accrued and unpaid interest on such notes. 

Refer to the  Long-Term Debt  footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these financing transactions. 

Acquisition and Divestiture Highlights 

On July 27, 2016, we completed the sale of our interest in our enhanced oil recovery project in the North Ward Estes field in Ward and Winkler counties of Texas, including our interest in certain CO  2   properties in the McElmo Dome field in Colorado, two contracts for the supply and delivery of CO  2  , and certain other related assets and liabilities (the  North Ward Estes Properties ) for a cash purchase price of $300 million (before closing adjustments).  The sale was effective July 1, 2016 and resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $188 million.  In addition to the cash purchase price, the buyer has agreed to pay us $100,000 for every $0.01 that, as of June 28, 2018, the average NYMEX crude oil futures contract price for each month from August 2018 through July 2021 is above $50.00/Bbl up to a maximum amount of $100 million (the  Contingent Payment ).  The Contingent Payment will be made at the option of the buyer either in cash on July 31, 2018 or in the form of a secured promissory note, accruing interest at 8% per annum with a maturity date of July 29, 2022.  We used the net proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under our credit agreement.  The North Ward Estes Properties consisted of estimated proved reserves of 120.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2015, representing 15% of our proved reserves as of that date, and generated 6% (or 8.6 MBOE/d) of our June 2016 average daily net production.

Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Sale  s  .  Our oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenue   decreased     $732   million to   $942     m  illion when comparing   the first nine months of 2016   to   the same period in   201  5  .  Sales revenue is a function of oil, NGL and gas volumes sold and average commodity prices realized.  Our oil sales volumes   de  creased   27%  ,    while   our NGL   and natural gas   sales volumes increased   27%   and   2%, respectively,   between period  s.  The oil volume decrease between periods   was   primarily   attributable to   normal field production decline across several of our areas   resulting from reduced drilling and completion activity during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016 in response to the depressed commodity price environment.  In addition, we completed several non-core oil and gas   property divestitures   during 2015 and 2016,     which negatively impacted oil production in the first nine months of 2016 by 1,  750   MBbl  .  These decreases were partially offset by new wells drilled and completed in the Williston   B  asin   and DJ Basin   which added   4,495   MBbl   and 545 MBbl, respectively,   of oil production during the first   nine months   of 2016   as compared to the first nine months of 2015  .     Our NGL sales volume increases between periods generally relate to additional volumes processed as more wells were connected to gas processing plants in the Williston Basin, as well as new wells drilled and completed in the Williston Basin and DJ Basin over the last twelve months.  Many of the new Williston Basin wells are in areas with higher gas-to-oil production ratios than previously drilled areas.  These NGL volume increases were partially offset by normal field production decline across several of our areas.  T  he gas volume increase between periods   was   primarily   due to     drilling success at our Williston Basin and DJ Basin properties which resulted in 7,480 MMcf and 1,025 MMcf, respectively, of additional gas volumes during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015  .    In addition, gas volumes increased between periods as more wells were connected to gas processing plants in the Williston Basin over the last twelve months in an effort to increase our overall gas capture rate in this area.    Th  ese   gas volume increase  s    w  ere     largely   offset by   the 2015 property divestitures, which negatively impacted gas production in the first nine months of 2016 by 5,  435   MMcf, as well as   normal field production decline across several of our areas  .

Table of Contents  

In addition to   production-related   de  creases in net revenue   there were also significant decreases   in the average sales price realized for   oil, NGLs and   natural gas in   the first nine months of   201  6   compared to 201  5.    Our average price for oil before the effects of hedging decreased   23%,   our average price for NGLs decreased   42% and our average price for natural gas decreased 49%   between periods. 

Loss on Sale of Properties.    During the first nine months of 2016, we sold our interest in the   North Ward Estes Properties for net   cash   proceeds of $295 million, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $188 million.  There were no other property divestitures resulting in a significant gain or loss on sale during the first nine months of 2016.  During the first nine months of 2015, we sold our interests in certain non-core producing oil and gas wells for aggregate net proceeds of $339 million, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $62 million. 

Lease Operating Expenses  .  Our lease operating expenses ( LOE ) during the first   nine months   of 201  6   were   $308   million, a   $128 million de  crease over the same period in 201  5  .    This decrease was   primarily   due to (i) $  57   million of lower LOE attributable to properties that we divested, (ii) a $  55   million decline in the costs of oilfield goods and services resulting from cost reduction measures we have implemented as well as the general downturn in the oil and gas industry and     (iii)   a    reduction   in well workover activity   between periods.    Workovers decreased from $  42   million in the first   nine months of 2015   to $  26   million in the first   nine months   of 201  6  , primarily due to a   reduction in   well workover   activity   at our   EOR   project at North Ward Estes  , which we sold in July 2016  .    

Our lease operating expenses on a BOE basis   also   decreased when comparing the first   nine months   of 201  6   to the same 201  5   period.  LOE per BOE amounted to   $8.40   during the first   nine months   of 201  6  , which represents a decrease of   $1.21   per BOE   (or 13%)   from the first   nine months   of 201  5  .  This decrease was mainly due to   the impact of property divestitures, the declining costs of goods and services in the industry and lower well workover costs, as discussed above, partially offset by lower   overall production volumes between periods.    The properties sold during 2015 and 2016 consisted mainly of mature oil and gas producing properties with LOE per BOE rates that were higher than our overall blended corporate rate. 

Production Taxes  .  Our production taxes during the first   nine months   of 201  6   were   $79   million, a   $66   million decrease over the same period in 201  5  , which decrease was primarily due to lower oil, NGL and natural gas sales between periods.  Our production taxes, however, are generally calculated as a percentage of net sales revenue before the effects of hedging, and this percentage on a company-wide basis was   8.4%   and   8.7%   for the first   nine months   of 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.    This decrease primarily relates to a reduction in the severance tax rate in North Dakota from 11.5% in 2015 to 10% in 2016. 

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  .  Our depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) expense   decreased     $21   million in 201  6   as compared to the first   nine months   of 201  5  .  The components of our DD A expense were as follows (in thousands): 

DD A   decreased between periods   primarily due to $  15   million in   lower   depletion expense.    This decrease was mainly attributable to a $210 million     de  crease   due to lower   overall production volumes during the first   nine months   of 201  6, which was partially offset by a   $  195 million increase in expense   related to   a higher depletion rate between periods  .  On a BOE basis, our overall DD A r  ate of   $24.61   for the first   nine months   of 201  6   was   21%     higher   than the rate of   $20.36   for the same period in 201  5  .  The primary factor  s     contributing to   this   higher     DD A rate we  re   (i)   decreases to proved and proved developed reserves over the last twelve months   primarily attributable to lower average oil and natural gas prices used to calculate our reserves, (ii)   $  743     m  illion in drilling and development expenditures during the past twelve months  , and (iii)   property divestitures  .  These factors that negatively impacted our DD A rate were partially offset by impairment write-downs on proved oil and gas properties recognized in the third quarter of 2015  . 

Exploration and Impairment  .  Our exploration and impairment costs   de  creased   $1.7     b  illion for the first   nine months   of 201  6   as compared to the same period in 201  5  .  The components of our exploration and impairment   expense    w  ere as follows (in thousands):

Exploration costs   de  creased $  68   million during the first   nine months   of 201  6   as compared to the same period in 201  5   primarily due to   lower rig termination fees incurred between periods and a decrease in geology-related general and administrative expenses  .    Rig termination fees amounted to $18 million during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to $76 million during the first nine months of 2015.  Geology-related general and administrative expenses decreased $5 million between periods. 

Impairment expense for the first nine months of 2016 primarily related to the amortization of leasehold costs associated with individually insignificant unproved properties, and such amortization resulted in impairment expense of $45 million during the first nine months of 2016.  Impairment expense for the first nine months of 2015 primarily related to (i) $1.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges for the partial write-down of our North Ward Estes field in Texas and other non-core proved oil and gas properties primarily in Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota and Colorado that were not being developed due to depressed oil and gas prices, (ii) $70 million of leasehold amortization associated with individually insignificant unproved properties, (iii) $62 million of impairment write-downs on our CO  2   development properties whose net book values exceeded their undiscounted future net cash flows and (iv) $49 million in impairment write-downs of undeveloped acreage costs for leases where we had no future plans to drill. 

Goodwill Impairment.      As a result of a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock during the third quarter of 2015 caused by a significant decline in crude oil and natural gas prices over that same period, we performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.  The impairment test indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, and further that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to goodwill.  Based on these results, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $870 million in the third quarter of 2015 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to zero. 

General and Administrative  .  We report general and administrative   ( G A )   expenses net of third-party reimbursements and internal allocations.  The components of our   G A   expenses were as follows (in thousands): 

G A   expense  s   before reimb  ursements and allocations   de  creased   $37   million during the   first nine months   of 201  6   as compared to the same period in 201  5 primarily due to lower employee compensation, savings realized as a result of cost reduction measures we have implemented and the impact of property divestitures.  Employee compensation decreased $22 million for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to reductions in personnel over the past twelve months.    The   de  crease in reimbursements   and allocations for the first   nine months   of 201  6   was   the result of   a   lower   number of field workers on Whiting-operated properties   due to reduced drilling activity and property divestitures over the past twelve months  . 

Our general and administrative expenses on a BOE basis, however, increased when comparing the first nine months of 2016 to the same 2015 period.  G A expense per BOE amounted to $3.07 during the first nine months of 2016, which represents an increase of $0.12 per BOE (or 4%) from the first nine months of 2015.  This increase was mainly due to lower overall production volumes between periods, partially offset by lower employee compensation and savings realized as a result of our cost reduction measures. 

Interest Expense  .  The components of our interest expense were as follows (in thousands): 

The   de  crease in interest expen  se of   $3   million between periods was mainly attributable to   lower   interest costs incurred on our notes  , partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issue costs, discounts and premiums   during the first   nine months   of 201  6   as compared to the first   nine months   of 201  5  .  The   $52 million de  crease in note interest   was     primarily   due to   (i) $56 million   incurred   during 2015   on the $1.6 billion of   Kodiak N  otes we assumed as part of the Kodiak Acquisition  , all of which were subsequently

repurchased during 2015, and (ii) an $11 million decrease in note interest due to the conversions of the New Convertible Notes in May 2016 and the Mandatory Convertible Notes in July and August 2016.      This decrease in interest expense was partially offset by   our March 2015 issuance of $  1,250     m  illion of 2020     Convertible Senior Notes   and $750 million of 2023 Senior Notes, which resulted in a $15 million increase in interest expense between periods  .    The increase in amortization of debt issue costs, discounts and premiums of $39 million is primarily due to (i) a non-cash charge of $14 million for the acceleration of unamortized debt discounts in connection with the induced   exchange   of a portion of our Mandatory Convertible Notes in August 2016, (ii) $  11   million of amortization of debt discount on the Mandatory Convertible Notes issued in June and July 2016, (iii) a non-cash charge of $6 million for the acceleration of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with a reduction of the aggregate commitments under our credit agreement in March 2016 and (iv) a $5 million increase in amortization of debt discount on the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes issued in March 2015. 

Our weighted average debt outstanding during the first   nine months   of 201  6   was $  5.2   billion versus $  5.7   billion for the first   nine months   of 201  5  .  Our weighted average effective cash interest rate was   4.4  % during the first   nine months   of 201  6   compared to   5.1  % for the first   nine months   of 201  5  . 

(Gain)   Loss   on Extinguishment of Debt.    During the first nine months of 2016, we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $42 million.  In March 2016, we completed the exchange of $477 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes   for   the same aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes, and recognized a $91 million gain on extinguishment of debt.  During the second quarter of 2016, the holders of the New Convertible Notes voluntarily converted all $477 million aggregate principal amount of the New Convertible Notes for approximately 41.8 million shares of our common stock, and     we   recognized a $188 million loss on extinguishment of debt   upon conversion  .    In June and July 2016, we completed the exchange of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, convertible senior notes and senior subordinated notes for the same aggregate principal amount of Mandatory Convertible Notes, and   recognized a $  57 million   gain on extinguishment of debt.    Subsequently in July, $333 million aggregate principal amount of the Mandatory Convertible Notes were converted into approximately 33.2 million shares of our common stock, and we recognized a $3 million gain on extinguishment of debt upon conversion.  In August 2016, we induced the   exchange   of an additional $38 million aggregate principal amount of the Mandatory Convertible Notes   for   approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock, and we recognized a $4 million debt inducement expense.  During the first nine months of 2015, we   repurchased $  752 m  illion aggregate principal amount of the Kodiak Notes   then outstanding, and recognized a    $  6   million loss on extinguishment of debt  .  Refer to the  Long-Term Debt  footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these debt transactions. 

Derivative   Gain  , Net.        O  ur commodity derivative contracts   and   embedded derivatives are marked     to     market each quarter with fair value gains and losses recognized immedia  tely in earnings as derivative (  gain  ) loss  , net.  Cash flow, however, is only impacted to the extent that settlements under these contracts result in making or receiving a paym  ent to or from   the counterparty.  Derivative   gain, net amounted to a   gain   of   $28   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016  , which consisted of     a    $  56   million fair value   gain   on embedded derivative  s, partially   offset by a   $28 million loss on commodity derivative contracts resulting from   the   upward   shift in the futures curve of forecasted commodity prices ( forward price curve ) for crude oil from January 1, 2016   (or the 2016 date on which new contracts were entered into)   to   September 30  , 2016  .  Derivative   gain, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2015   consisted of   a   $  115   million   gain     on commodity derivative contracts primarily   due to   the     downward   sh  ift in the same forward price curve from January 1, 201  5   (or the 201  5   date on which prior year contracts   were entered into) to   September 30  , 201  5  .

Income Tax   Expense (Benefit)  .    Income tax expense for the first nine months of 2016 totaled   $182   million as compared to a benefit of   $726   million for the first nine months of 2015, an increase of   $908   million that was mainly related to (i)     $1.9 billion in lower pre-tax loss between periods, (ii) a $454 million non-cash charge in the third quarter of 2016 resulting from an ownership   shift   as defined   under Section 382 of the     Internal Revenue Code which   will   limit our usage of certain net operating losses   and tax credits   in the future, as discussed   above under      Financing Highlights   , and (iii) the tax impact associated with the issuance and subsequent conversion of the New Convertible Notes and the Mandatory Convertible Notes during the first nine months of 2016. 

Our effective tax rates for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 differ from the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and permanent taxable differences.  Excluding the impact of the Section 382 limitation discussed above, our overall effective tax rate increased from   25.5%   for the first nine months of 2015 to   27.7%   for the first nine months   of 201  6  .  This   in  crease is mainly the result of   $870 million in goodwill impairment recognized during the third quarter of 2015 which is not tax deductible, partially offset by permanent tax differences associated with the issuance and subsequent conversion of the New Convertible Notes and the Mandatory Convertible Notes during the first nine months of 2016.

Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Sales  .  Our oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenue decreased $189 million to $316 million when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the same period in 2015.  Sales revenue is a function of oil, NGL and gas volumes sold and average commodity prices realized.  Our oil sales volumes decreased 34%, while our NGL and natural gas sales volumes increased 9% and 4%, respectively, between periods.  The oil volume decrease between periods was primarily attributable to normal field production decline across several of our areas resulting from reduced drilling and completion activity during 2016 in response to the depressed commodity price environment.  In addition, we completed several non-core oil and gas property divestitures during the past twelve months, which negatively impacted oil production in the third quarter of 2016 by 755 MBbl.    These decreases were partially offset by new wells drilled and completed in the Williston   B  asin   and DJ Basin   which added   1,290   MBbl   and 285 MBbl, respectively,   of oil production during the   third quarter   of 2016   as compared to the third quarter of 2015  .     Our NGL sales volume increases between periods generally relate to additional volumes processed as more wells were connected to gas processing plants in the Williston Basin, as well as new wells drilled and completed in the Williston Basin and DJ Basin over the last twelve months.  Many of the new Williston Basin wells are in areas with higher gas-to-oil production ratios than previously drilled areas.  These NGL volume increases were partially offset by normal field production decline across several of our areas.  T  he gas volume increase between periods   was   primarily   due to     drilling success at our Williston Basin and DJ Basin properties which resulted in 2,040 MMcf and 340 MMcf, respectively, of additional gas volumes during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015  .    In addition, gas volumes increased between periods as more wells were connected to gas processing plants in the Williston Basin over the last twelve months in an effort to increase our overall gas capture rate in this area.    Th  ese   gas volume increase  s    w  ere     largely   offset by   property divestitures over the past twelve months, which negatively impacted gas production in the third quarter of 2016 by 550 MMcf, as well as   normal field production decline across several of our areas  .

In addition to production-related decreases in net revenue there were also significant decreases in the average sales price realized for oil, NGLs and natural gas in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015.  Our average price for oil before the effects of hedging decreased 7%, our average price for NGLs decreased 18%, and our average price for natural gas decreased 37% between periods. 

Loss on Sale of Properties.    During the third quarter of 2016,   we sold our interest in the   North Ward Estes Properties for net   cash   proceeds of $295 million, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $188 million.  There were no other property divestitures resulting in a significant gain or loss on sale during the third quarter of 2016 or 2015. 

Lease Operating Expenses  .  Our lease operating expenses during the third quarter of 2016 were $88 million, a $38 million decrease over the same period in 2015.  This decrease was   primarily   due to (i) $17 million of lower LOE attributable to properties that we divested, (ii) a $16 million decline in the costs of oilfield goods and services resulting from cost reduction measures we have implemented as well as the general downturn in the oil and gas industry and (iii) a reduction in well workover activity between periods.  Workovers decreased from $13 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $8 million in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to a reduction in well workover activity at our EOR project at North Ward Estes, which we sold in July 2016, and at our Parshall field. 

Our lease operating expenses on a BOE basis also decreased when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the same 2015 period.  LOE per BOE amounted to $7.98 during the third quarter of 2016, which represents a decrease of $0.52 per BOE (or 6%) from the third quarter of 2015.  This decrease was mainly due to the impact of property divestitures, the declining costs of goods and services in the industry and lower well workover costs, as discussed above, partially offset by lower overall production volumes between periods.  The properties sold during 2015 and 2016 consisted mainly of mature oil and gas producing properties with LOE per BOE rates that were higher than our overall blended corporate rate. 

Production Taxes  .  Our production taxes during the third quarter of 2016 were $26 million, an $18 million decrease over the same period in 2015, which decrease was primarily due to lower oil, NGL and natural gas sales between periods.  Our production taxes, however, are generally calculated as a percentage of net sales revenue before the effects of hedging, and this percentage on a company-wide basis was 8.4% and   8.8%   for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This decrease primarily relates to a reduction in the severance tax rate in North Dakota from 11.5% in 2015 to 10% in 2016. 

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  .  Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased $32 million in 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The components of our DD A expense were as follows (in thousands): 

DD A decreased between periods primarily due to $31 million in lower depletion expense between periods.  Of this decrease, $95 million related to a decrease in our overall production volumes during the third quarter of 2016, which was partially offset by a $64 million increase related to a higher depletion rate between periods.  On a BOE basis, our overall DD A rate of $25.80 for the third quarter of 2016 was 21% higher than the rate of   $21.40   for the same period in 2015.  The primary factors contributing to this higher DD A rate were (i) decreases to proved and proved developed reserves over the last twelve months primarily attributable to lower average oil and natural gas prices used to calculate our reserves, (ii) $743 million in drilling and development expenditures during the past twelve months, and (iii) property divestitures.  These factors that negatively impacted our DD A rate were partially offset by impairment write-downs on proved oil and gas properties recognized in the third quarter of 2015. 

Exploration and Impairment Costs  .  Our exploration and impairment costs decreased $1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  The components of our exploration and impairment costs were as follows (in thousands): 

34   

Table of Contents  

Exploration costs decreased $12 million during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $9 million decrease in rig termination fees incurred between periods  . 

Impairment expense for the third quarter of 2016 primarily related to the amortization of leasehold costs associated with individually insignificant unproved properties, and such amortization resulted in impairment expense of $15 million during the third quarter of 2016.  Impairment expense for the third quarter of 2015 primarily related to (i) $1.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges for the partial write-down of our North Ward Estes field in Texas and other non-core proved oil and gas properties primarily in Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota and Colorado that were not being developed due to depressed oil and gas prices, (ii) $62 million of impairment write-downs on our CO  2   development properties whose net book values exceeded their undiscounted future net cash flows, (iii) $48 million in impairment write-downs of undeveloped acreage costs for leases where we had no future plans to drill and (iv) $20 million of leasehold amortization associated with individually insignificant unproved properties. 

Goodwill Impairment.      As a result of a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock during the third quarter of 2015 caused by a significant decline in crude oil and natural gas prices over that same period, we performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.  The impairment test indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, and further that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to goodwill.  Based on these results, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $870 million in the third quarter of 2015 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to zero. 

General and Administrative Expenses  .  We report general and administrative expenses net of third-party reimbursements and internal allocations.  The components of our G A expenses were as follows (in thousands): 

G A expenses before reimbursements and allocations decreased $15 million during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower employee compensation, savings realized as a result of cost reduction measures we have implemented and the impact of property divestitures.  Employee compensation decreased $11 million for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to reductions in personnel over the past twelve months.  The decrease in reimbursements and allocations for the third quarter of 2016 was the result of a lower number of field workers on Whiting-operated properties due to reduced drilling activity and property divestitures over the past twelve months. 

Our general and administrative expenses on a BOE basis, however, increased when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the same 2015 period.  G A expense per BOE amounted to $3.07 during the third quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of $0.04 per BOE (or 1%) from the third quarter of 2015.  This increase was mainly due to lower overall production volumes between periods, partially offset by lower employee compensation and savings realized as a result of our cost reduction measures. 

Interest Expense  .  The components of our interest expense were as follows (in thousands): 

Our note interest expense decreased $26 million between periods primarily due to (i) $16 million of interest cost incurred in the third quarter of 2015 on the $800 million of 2019 Kodiak Notes we assumed as part of the Kodiak Acquisition, which were subsequently repurchased in December 2015, and (ii) a $10 million decrease in note interest due to the conversions of the New Convertible Notes in May 2016 and the Mandatory Convertible Notes in July and August 2016.  Amortization of debt issue costs, discounts and premiums increased $20 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to (i) a non-cash charge of $14 million for the acceleration of unamortized debt discounts in connection with the induced   exchange   of a portion of our Mandatory Convertible Notes in August 2016 and (ii) $  11   million of amortization of debt discount on the Mandatory Convertible Notes issued in

June and July 2016.  These increases were partially offset by a $  6    million decrease in amortization of debt discount on the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes between periods due to the exchange and subsequent conversion of these notes in June and July 2016. 

Our weighted average debt outstanding during the third quarter of 2016 was $4.6 billion versus $5.5 billion for the third quarter of 2015.  Our weighted average effective cash interest rate was 4.4% during the third quarter of 2016 compared to 5.3% for the third quarter of 2015. 

(Gain) L  oss   on Extinguishment of Debt.    During the third quarter of 2016, we recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $47 million.  In July 2016, we completed the exchange of $964 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, convertible senior notes and senior subordinated notes for the same aggregate principal amount of Mandatory Convertible Notes, and   recognized a $  48 million   gain on extinguishment of debt.    Subsequently in July, $333 million aggregate principal amount of the Mandatory Convertible Notes were converted into approximately 33.2 million shares of our common stock, and we recognized a $3 million gain on extinguishment of debt upon conversion.  In August 2016, we induced the   exchange   of an additional $38 million aggregate principal amount of the Mandatory Convertible Notes   for   approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock, and we recognized a $4 million debt inducement expense.  Refer to the  Long-Term Debt  footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these debt transactions. 

Derivative Gain, Net.    Our commodity derivative contracts and embedded derivatives are marked to market each quarter with fair value gains and losses recognized immediately in earnings as derivative (gain) loss, net.  Cash flow, however, is only impacted to the extent that settlements under these contracts result in making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty.  Derivative gain, net amounted to a gain of $30 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which consisted of a $22 million gain on commodity derivative contracts resulting from the downward shift in the forward price curve for crude oil from July 1, 2016 (or the 2016 date on which new contracts were entered into) to September 30, 2016, as well as an $8 million fair value gain on embedded derivatives.  Derivative gain, net for the three months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of a   $208   million gain on commodity derivative contracts primarily due to a more significant downward shift in the same forward price curve for crude oil from July 1, 2015 (or the 2015 date on which prior year contracts were entered into) to September 30, 2015. 

Refer to Item 3,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , for a list of our outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of October 1, 2016. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)  .  Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 totaled   $358   million as compared to a benefit of   $595   million for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of   $952   million that was mainly related to (i) $2.1 billion in lower pre-tax loss between periods, (ii) a $454 million non-cash charge in the third quarter of 2016 resulting from an ownership   shift   as defined   under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code which   will   limit our usage of certain net operating losses   and tax credits   in the future, as discussed   above under  Financing Highlights   , and (iii) the tax impact associated with the issuance and subsequent conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes during the third quarter of 2016. 

Our effective tax rates for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 differ from the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and permanent taxable differences.  Excluding the impact of the Section 382 limitation discussed above, our overall effective tax rate increased from   24.2%   for the third quarter of 2015 to   28.9%   for the third quarter of 2016.  This increase is mainly the result of $870 million in goodwill impairment recognized during the third quarter of 2015 which is not tax deductible, partially offset by permanent tax differences associated with the issuance and subsequent conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes during the third quarter of 2016.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overvie  w  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had $  18   million of cash on hand and $  4.6   billion of equity, while at   December 31, 2015  , we had $  16   million of cash on hand and $  4.8   billion of equity. 

One of the primary sources of variability in our cash flows from operating activities is commodity price volatility, which we partially mitigate through the use of commodity hedge contracts.  Oil accounted for   72% and 80  % of our total production in the first   nine months   of 201  6   and 201  5, respectively  .  As a result, our operating cash flows are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in NGL or natural gas prices.    As of   October 1  , 201  6  , we had derivative contracts covering the sale of approximately   66%   of our forecasted oil production volumes for the remainder of 201  6  .    For a list of all of our outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of October 1, 2016, refer to Item 3,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 

During the first   nine months   of 201  6  , we generated $  358   million of cash provided by operating activities, a   de  crease of $  543   million over the same period in 201  5  .  Cash provided by operating activities   de  creased primarily due to   lower realized sales prices for   oil  , NGLs   and natural gas   and lower     crude oil production volumes   in the first   nine months   of 201  6.    These   negative   factors were partially offset by   higher NGL and natural gas   production volumes, as well as lower lease operating expenses, exploration costs, production

During the first   nine months   of 201  6  , cash flows from operating activities     plus   $304 million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties were used to finance   $  435 m  illion of drilling and development expenditures  , $150 million in net repayments under our credit agreement, $42 million of early conversion payments on our New Convertible Notes and $22 million of debt issuance costs.    

Exploration   and   Development Expenditures  .  The following chart details our exploration   and   development expenditures incurred by   core area   (in thousands): 

(1) 

On July 27, 2016, we sold our North Ward Estes Properties, including all of our assets in the Permian Basin.     

We continually evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources.    Our current   201  6     exploration and development     ( E D )   budget   is    $  550     m  illion, which we expect to fund substantially with net cash provided by our operating activities,   proceeds from property divestitures and, if necessary,   borrowings under our credit facility  .    The overall budget   represents a substantial decrease from the $  2.3   billion   we   incurred on   E D   expenditures during 201  5  .  This reduced capital budget is in response to the significantly lower crude oil prices experienced during 2015   and continuing into 2016 and our plan to more closely align our capital spending with cash flows generated from operations.  As part of this plan, we suspended completion operations at our Redtail field beginning in the second quarter of   2016; however, we plan to resume completions in this area in early 2017  .  We expect to allocate $  490     m  illion of our 201  6   budget to exploration and development activity  ,   and   the remainder will be allocated     to   facilities  , drilling rig termination fees and undeveloped acreage purchases  .  We believe that should additional attractive acquisition opportunities arise or   E D   expenditures exceed $  550 m  illion, we will be able to finance additional capital expenditures with borrowings under our credit agreement, agreements with industry partners or divestitures of certain oil and gas property interests.  Our level of   E D   expenditures is largely discretionary, and the amount of funds   we   devote to any particular activity may increase or decre  ase significantly depending on   commodity prices, cash flows  , available opportunities   and development results, among other factors.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plan     over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.      With our expected cash flow streams, commodity price hedging strategies, current liquidity levels   (including availability under our credit agreement)  , access to debt and equity markets and flexibility to modify future capital expenditure programs, we expect to be able to fund all planned capital programs and debt repayments, comply with our debt covenants, and meet other obligations that may arise from our oil and gas operations. 

Credit Agreement  .  Whiting   Oil and Gas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, has a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that as of   September 30, 2016   had a borrowing base of   $2.6   billion, with aggregate commitments of   $2.5   billion.    In October 2016,   our borrowing base under the facility was reduced to $2.5 billion   in connection with the November 1, 2016 regular borrowing base redetermination  ,    with no change to our aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion.    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.8   billion of available borrowing capacity, which was net of   $650 million in borrowings and $11   million in letters of credit outstanding. 

The borrowing base under the credit agreement is determined at the discretion of the lenders, based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to such lenders, and is subject to regular redeterminations on May 1 and November 1 of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement, in each case which may reduce the amount of the borrowing bas  e.    Because oil and gas prices are principal inputs into the valuation of our reserves, if   current and projected   oil and gas prices remain at their current levels for a prolonged period or further decline, our borrowing base could be reduced at the next redetermination date  , which is scheduled for May 1, 2017,   or during future redeterminations.  Upon a redetermination of our borrowing base, either on a periodic or special redetermination date,   if borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing capacity were outstanding, we could be forced to immediately repay a portion of our debt outstanding under the credit agreement.    The credit agreement permits us to dispose of our ownership interests in certain gas gathering and processing plants located in North Dakota without reducing the borrowing base.

A portion of the revolving credit facility in an aggr  egate amount not to exceed $  50   million may b  e used to issue letters of credit for the account of Whiting Oil and Gas or other designated subsidiaries of ours.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,    $39   million was available for additional letters of credit under the agreement. 

The credit agreement provides for interest only payments until   December 2019, when the credit agreement expires and   all outstanding borrowings are due.      Interest under the revolving credit facility accrues at our option at either (i) a base rate for a base rate loan plus the margin in the table below, where the base rate is defined as the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% per annum, or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a Eurodollar loan plus the margin in the table below.  Additionally, we also incur commitment fees as set forth in the table below on the unused portion of the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the revolving credit facility. 

The credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, make loans to others, make investments, enter into mergers, enter into hedging contracts, incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of our lenders.    However, the credit agreement permits us and certain of our subsidiaries to issue second lien indebtedness of up to $1.0 billion subject to certain conditions and limitations.    Except for limited exceptions, the credit agreement also restricts our ability to make any dividend payments or distributio  ns on our common stock.  These restrictions apply to all of   our restricted   subsidiaries   (as defined in the credit agreement)  .  The credit agreement requires us, as of the last day of any quarter,   to maintain the following ratios (as defined in the credit agreement):   (i) a consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities ratio (which includes an add back of the available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement) of not less th  an 1.0 to 1.0  ,   (ii)     a total   senior secured   debt to the last four quarters  EBITDAX ratio   of less than     3.0   to 1.0   during the Interim Covenant Period (defined below), and thereafter a total debt to EBITDAX ratio of less than 4.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a ratio of the last four quarters  EBITDAX to consolidated cash interest charges of not less than 2.25 to 1.0 during the Interim Covenant Period.  Under the credit agreement, the  Interim Covenant Period  is defined as the period from June 30, 2015 until the earlier of (a) April 1, 2018 or (b) the commencement of an investment-grade debt rating period (as defined in the credit agreement).    We were in compliance with our covenants under the credit agreement as of   September 30, 2016  .        However, a substantial or extended decline in oil, NGL or natural gas prices may adversely affect our ability to comply with these covenants in the future.

For the remaining $562 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Senior Notes, we have the option to settle conversions of the these notes with cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election.  Our intent is to settle the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes in cash upon conversion.  Prior to January 1, 2020, the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the holder s option only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the measurement period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.  On or after January 1, 2020, the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the April 1, 2020 maturity date of the notes.  The notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 25.6410 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $39.00.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events.  In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase, in certain circumstances, the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2020 Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such corporate event.  As of September 30, 2016, none of the contingent conditions allowing holders of the 2020 Convertible Senior Notes to convert these notes had been met. 

Exchange of Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes for Mandatory Convertible Notes.    On June 29, 2016 we completed the exchange of $129 million aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Convertible Senior Notes for the same aggregate principal amount of new 1.25% Mandatory Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, Series 2 (the  2020 Mandatory Convertible Notes, Series 2 ).

(the  Threshold Price )  .    Upon conversion  , the   common stock issue   price   per share is   equal   to   the higher of (i) the Daily VWAP for   our     c  ommon   s  tock for such trading day multiplied by   one   plus     zero   for the 2018 Mandatory Convertible Notes,   one   plus   0.5%   for the 2019 Mandatory Convertible Notes,   one   plus   8.0%   for the 2020 Mandatory Convertible Notes,   one   plus   2.5%   for the 2021 Mandatory Convertible Notes and   one   plus   3.5%   for the 2023 Mandatory Convertible Notes     or   (ii)     $8.75   for the 2018 Mandatory Convertible Notes (equivalent to   114.29   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes),   $8.79   for the 2019 Mandatory Convertible Notes (equivalent to   113.72   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes),   $9.45     for the 2020 Mandatory Convertible Notes (equivalent to   105.82   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes),   $8.97   for the 2021 Mandatory Convertible Notes (equivalent to   111.50   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes) and   $9.06   for the 2023 Mandatory Convertible Notes (equivalent to   110.42   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes)   (the  Minimum Conversion Price  s   )  . 

During the Observation Period, the Daily VWAP of our common stock was above the Threshold Price (i) for   7   of the   2  5 trading days for the 2018 Mandatory Convertible Notes, the 2019 Mandatory Convertible Notes, the 2021 Mandatory Convertible Notes and the 2023 Mandatory Convertible Notes and (ii) for   8   of the   2  5 trading days for the 2020 Mandatory Convertible Notes.    As a result,   $  333 million aggregate principal amount of the Mandatory Convertible Notes were converted into approximately 33.2 million shares of our common stock  . 

After the Observation Period,   we   ha  ve   the right to mandatorily convert   any remaining     Mandatory   Convertible     Notes     if the Daily VWAP of   our c  ommon   s  tock exceeds   $8.75   for at least   20   trading days during a   30   consecutive trading day period and holders have the right to convert the   Mandatory Convertible Notes   at any time.    T  he conversion price   after the Observation Period   will be the Minimum Conversion Price   for each applicable series of Mandatory Convertible Notes  .      As of September 30, 2016,   none of the   conditions   allowing   us   to convert   the remaining Mandatory Convertible N  otes had been met  , and no holders of the Mandatory Convertible Notes had voluntarily converted any such notes  . 

Induced   Exchange     of Mandatory Convertible Notes.    On August 12,   2016, we completed the exchange of (i) $13 million aggregate principal amount of our   2018   Mandatory   Convertible Notes   which had a conversion price of $8.75 per share (equivalent to   114.29   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes) for   shares of our common stock at an issuance   price of $7.77 per share (equivalent to 128.69 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes) and (ii) $25 million aggregate principal amount of our 2019 Mandatory Convertible Notes which had a conversion price of $8.79 per share (equivalent to   113.72   common shares per   $1,000   principal amount of the notes) for   shares of our common stock at an issuance   price of $7.80 per share (equivalent to 128.17 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes).  Upon acceptance of this inducement offer by the holders of the notes, such notes were immediately   cancelled in exchange for   approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock. 

The indentures governing the   Nonconvertible   Whiting Notes   and certain of the Mandatory Convertible Notes   restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, unless our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) is at least 2.0 to 1.  If we were in violation of   this covenant  , then we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness, including under Whiting Oil and Gas  credit agreement.  Additionally, the  se   indentures contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, pay cash dividends, make certain other restricted payments, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or our subordinated debt, make investments or issue preferred stock, sell assets, consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of ours and our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole, and enter into hedging contracts.  These covenants may potentially limit the discretion of our management in certain respects.    We were in compliance with these covenants as o  f    September 30, 2016  .  However, a substantial or extended decline in oil, NGL or natural gas prices may adversely affect our ability to comply with these cove  nants in the future. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

Schedule of Contractual Obligations  .  The following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of   September 30, 2016   to m  ake future payments under certain contracts, aggregated by category of contractual obligation, for   the time periods   specified   below.    Th  is   table does not include   amounts payable under contracts where we cannot predict with accuracy the amount and timing of such payments, including any amounts we may be obligated to pay under our derivative contracts as such payments are dependent upon the price of crude oil in effect at the time of settlement and   any penalties that may be incurred   for underdelivery   under   our physical delivery contracts  .    For further information on these contracts refer to the  Derivative Financial Instruments  footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements and  Delivery Commitments  in Item 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015  .

We have one water disposal agreement which expires in 2024, whereby we have contracted for the transportation and disposal of the produced water from our Redtail field.  Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to provide a minimum volume of produced water or else pay for any deficiencies at the price stipulated in the contract.  The obligations reported above represent our minimum financial commitments pursuant to the terms of this contract, however, our actual expenditures under this contract may exceed the minimum commitments presented above.     

(5) 

We have   two   take-or-pay purchase agreements, of which   one   agreement expires in 201  6    and   one   expire  s   in 20  20, whereby   we have committed to buy certain volumes of water for use in the fracture stimulation process   on wells we complete   in our Redtail field.  Under the terms of these agreements, we are obligated to purchase a minimum volume of water or else pay for any deficiencies at the price stipulated in the contract.  The purchasing obligations reported above represent our minimum financial commitments pursuant to the terms of these contracts, however, our actual expenditures under these contracts   may   exceed the minimum commitments presented above.

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   five   drilling rigs under long-term contract  , all of which   expire in 2017.    As of September 30, 2016, e  arly termination of   these   contracts would require   termination   penalties of $  36   million, which would be in lieu of paying the remaining drilling commitments under these contracts.     

Based on current oil and natural gas prices and anticipated levels of production, we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand and amounts available under our credit agreement, will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs, including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operati  ng,   development and exploration activities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Information regarding critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10   K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .    The following is a material update to such critical accounting policies and estimates: 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity.        All derivative instruments are recorded   i  n the consolidated   financial statements   at fair value, other than derivative instruments that meet the  normal purchase normal sale  exclusion or other derivative scope exceptions.  We do not currently apply hedge accounting to any of our outstanding derivative instruments, and as a result, all changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in earnings. 

We   determine the fair value of our derivative instruments measured at fair value   utilizing   third-party valuation specialists.  We review these valuations, including the related model inputs and assumptions, and analyze changes in fair value measurements between periods.  We corroborate such inputs, calculations and fair value changes using various methodologies, and review unobservable inputs for reasonableness utilizing relevant information from other published sources.        W  hen available, we utilize counterparty   valuations to assess the reasonableness of our valuations.  The values we report in our financial statements change as the assumptions used in these valuations are revised to reflect changes in market conditions (particularly those for oil and natural gas futures) or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

We periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility.  We primarily utilize costless collars which are generally placed with major financial institutions, as well as crude oil sales and delivery contracts.  We use hedging to help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage returns on our acquisitions and drilling programs.  Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.  While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements.        The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.  We evaluate the ability of our counterparties to perform at the inception of a hedging relationship and on a periodic basis as appropriate. 

We value our costless collars using industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.  We value our long-term crude oil sales and delivery contracts based on an income approach, which considers various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, market differentials for crude oil and U.S. Treasury rates.  The discount rates used in the fair values of these instruments include a measure of nonperformance risk by the counterparty or us,   as appropriate. 

In addition, we evaluate the terms of our convertible debt and other contracts, if any, to determine whether they contain embedded components   that   are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. 

We value  d   the embedded derivatives related to our convertible notes using a binomial lattice model which consider  ed   various inputs including (i) our common stock price, (ii) risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury rates, (iii) recovery rates   in the event of default  , (iv) default intensity and (v) volatility   of our common stock  . 

We also have an embedded derivative related to our purchase and sale agreement with the buyer of the North Ward Estes Properties, which includes a contingent payment linked to NYMEX crude oil prices.  We value this embedded derivative   using a   modified Black-Scholes   swaption pricing model which considers various assumptions,   including   quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and volatility factors.      The discount rate used in the fair value of this instrument includes a measure of the counterparty s nonperformance risk.

During 2015 and continuing into 2016, w  e experienced   de  creased costs due to   a decrease     in   demand for oil field products and services   in response to the sustained depressed commodity price environment  .  The oil and gas industry is very cyclical, and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers and others associated with the industry puts extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry.  Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase, so do all associated costs.  Conversely, in a period of declining prices, associated cost declines are likely to lag and not adjust downward in proportion to prices.

Material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations of bank loans, depletion expense, impairment assessments of oil and gas properties     and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions.  Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money and retain personnel.  While we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase   in the near term  , higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials, services and personnel. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This report contains statements that we believe to be  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  All statements other than historical facts, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, projected revenues, earnings, costs, capital expenditures and debt levels, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.

Item   3  .       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Commodity Price Risk 

The price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth.  Crude oil and natural gas are commodities, and therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively   minor changes in supply and demand.  Historically,   the   markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future.  Based on prod  uction for the first   nine months   of 201  6  , our income   (loss)   before income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have moved up or down   $86   million for each 10% change in oil prices per Bbl  ,    $4   million for each 10% change in NGL prices per Bbl and   $4   million for each 10% change in   natural   gas prices per Mcf. 

We periodically enter into derivative contracts to   achieve a more predictable c  ash flow by reducing   our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility.  Our derivative contracts have traditionally been costless collars, although we evaluate and have entered into other forms of derivative instruments as well.  Currently, we do not apply hedge accounting, and therefore all changes in commodity derivative fair values are recorded immediately to earnings. 

Commodity Derivative Contracts 

Crude Oil Costless Collars.        The col  lared hedges shown in the table   below have the effect of providing a protective floor while allowing us to share in upward pricing movement  s.  The three-way collars, however, do not provide complete protection against declines in crude oil prices due to the fact that when the market price falls below the sub-floor, the minimum price we would receive would be NYMEX plus the difference between the floor and the sub-floor.    W  hile these hedges are designed to reduce our exposure to price decreases, they also have the effect of limiting the benefit of price increases above the ceiling.    The fair value of these commodity derivative instruments at   September 30, 2016  , was a net asset of $  34   million.  A   hypothetical upward or downward shift of 10% per Bbl in the NYMEX forward curve   for crude oil   as of   September 30, 2016   would cause a decrease   of $  55   million   or   an   increase     of $  52     million, respectively,   in   this   fair value   asset  . 

Our outstanding   commodity derivative contracts     as of   October    1  , 201  6   are summarized below: 

(1) 

A three-way collar is a combination of options: a sold call, a purchased put and a sold put.  The sold call establishes a maximum price (ceiling) we will receive for the volumes under contract.  The purchased put establishes a minimum price (floor), unless the market price falls below the sold put (sub-floor), at which point the minimum price would be NYMEX plus the difference between the purchased put and the sold put strike price.     

Interest Rate Risk 

Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rate risk related to our credit agreement are included in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and have not materially changed since that report was filed. 

In March 2015, we issued 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 2020 (the  2020 Convertible   Senior   Notes ).  As the interest rate on these notes is fixed at 1.25%, we are not subject to any direct risk of loss related to fluctuations in interest rates.  However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of this debt instrument, which could impact the amount of gain or loss that we recognize in earnings upon conversion of the notes.  Refer to the  Long-Term Debt  and  Fair Value Measurements  footnotes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms and fair values of the 2020 Convertible   Senior   Notes.

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  .    In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chairman  , President   and Chief Executive Officer and our   Senior Vice President and   Chief Financial Officer  , the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based upon their evaluation of these disclosures controls and procedures, the Chairman  , President   and Chief Executive Officer and the   Senior Vice President and   Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting  .    There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item   1  .       Legal Proceedings   

Whiting is subject to litigation claims and governmental and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is management s opinion that the loss for any litigation matters and claims we are involved in that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

After the closing of the Kodiak Acquisition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) contacted us to discuss Kodiak s responses to a June 2014 information request from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the  CAA ).      In addition, in July 2015 and March 2016, we received information requests from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the CAA.      The information requests relate to tank batteries used in our Williston Basin operations and our compliance with certain regulatory requirements at those locations for the control of air pollutant emissions from those facilities.      We have responded to the EPA s July 2015 and March 2016 information requests, and such responses were also provided to the North Dakota Department of Health ( NDDoH ), with whom the EPA was coordinating in making the requests.      The EPA has sole authority to enforce CAA violations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and, to date, no formal federal enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter for our North Dakota tribal properties beyond receipt of the noted information requests.      We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of possible federal enforcement with respect to our North Dakota tribal properties, or other exclusively federal requirements at any of our North Dakota properties, at this time, which could result in civil penalties or require us to undertake corrective actions, or both. 

In connection with the above EPA inquiries, on October 18, 2016, the NDDoH concurrently filed in the North Dakota District Court for Burleigh County (the  Court ) a complaint against, and a settlement with, us regarding tank operation and other inspection-related alleged violations of North Dakota s air pollution control laws.      This complaint and settlement addresses approximately 94 percent of our North Dakota properties but does not address our North Dakota tribal property operations or exclusively federal requirements applicable to all of our North Dakota properties, which are governed by the EPA.      In the settlement, we and a significant number of North Dakota operators have worked with the NDDoH to develop inspection and repair measures to detect and prevent emissions from facilities even more effectively going forward.      We believe these measures will be included in settlements between the NDDoH and each participating operator.      We and the NDDoH, pending Court approval of the settlement, have agreed that we will pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million, of which $1.1 million may be reduced by up to 60 percent by early and continued implementation of the aforementioned inspection and repair measures and a quality control policy.      Whiting anticipates being able to qualify for all available penalty reductions.      The settlement is not an admission by Whiting of any violation. 

Item   1A.       Risk Factors   

Risk factors relating to us are contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10   K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .    T  he following is a material update to such risk factors: 

Our convertible senior notes   and our convertible senior subordinated notes   may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  

The market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our convertible senior notes   and convertible senior subordinated notes  .       For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by: 

investors  anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of our convertible senior notes   and convertible senior subordinated notes  ;     

possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible senior notes   and convertible senior subordinated notes   as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and     

hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our convertible senior notes  , our convertible senior subordinated notes   and our common stock.
