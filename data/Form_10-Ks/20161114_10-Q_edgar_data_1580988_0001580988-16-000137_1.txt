  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
  Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc. (the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation, incorporated on December 12, 2012, that elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning in its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. The Company is the sole general partner of and owns, directly or indirectly,   100%   of the partnership interests in Cole Operating Partnership V, LP, a Delaware limited partnership. The Company is externally managed by Cole REIT Advisors V, LLC ( CR V Advisors ), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the Company s sponsor, Cole Capital       , which is a trade name used to refer to a group of affiliated entities directly or indirectly controlled by VEREIT, Inc. ( VEREIT ), a widely-held public company whose shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: VER). VEREIT indirectly owns and/or controls the Company s external advisor, CR V Advisors, the Company s dealer manager, Cole Capital Corporation ( CCC ), the Company s property manager, CREI Advisors, LLC ( CREI Advisors ), and the Company s sponsor, Cole Capital.  
  Pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-11 (Registration No. 333-189891) (the  Registration Statement ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 17, 2014, the Company commenced its initial public offering on a  best efforts  basis of up to a maximum of   $2.975 billion   in shares of a single class of common stock. On February 7, 2014, the Company effected a reverse stock split, whereby every two and one-half shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding were combined into one share of the Company s common stock, resulting in a price change per share (the  Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the initial public offering offered up to a maximum of   $2.5 billion   in shares of a single class of common stock (now referred to as Class A Shares as defined below) in the primary offering at a price of   $25.00   per share until April 8, 2016 and   $26.37   per share effective April 11, 2016, as well as up to   $475.0 million   in additional shares pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the  Original DRIP ) at a price of   $23.75   per share until April 8, 2016 and   $24.00   per share effective April 11, 2016 (together with the Class T Shares as defined below, the  Offering ). In connection with Post-Effective Amendment No. 3 to the Company s Registration Statement, which was declared effective by the SEC on April 29, 2016, the Company began offering up to   $1,125,000,000  , of the   $2.5 billion   in shares that make up the primary portion of the Offering, in Class T shares of the Company s common stock (the  Class T Shares ) at a price of   $25.26   per share in the primary portion of the Offering, along with up to   $1,375,000,000   in Class A Shares at a price of   $26.37   per share in the primary portion of the Offering. The Company reserves the right to reallocate the shares being offered in the Offering among the classes of shares and between the primary offering and the DRIP, as defined below. 
  On March 18, 2014, the Company satisfied the conditions of the escrow agreement regarding the minimum offering amount under the Offering and issued approximately   110,000   shares of its common stock to VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. ( VEREIT OP ), an affiliate of Cole Capital and the operating partnership of VEREIT, resulting in gross proceeds of   $2.5 million  , and commenced principal operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued approximately   11.9 million   shares of common stock in the Offering for gross offering proceeds of   $297.6 million   (  $294.6 million   in Class A Shares and   $3.0 million   in Class T Shares) before organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees of   $30.1 million  . 
  On November 11, 2015, the Company s board of directors (the  Board ) approved the extension of the Offering until March 17, 2017, unless the Board terminates the Offering at an earlier date or all shares being offered have been sold, in which case the Offering will be terminated. Notwithstanding the extension of the Offering to March 17, 2017, the Board will continue to evaluate the timing for the close of the Offering. 
  Effective as of March 4, 2016, the Company changed the designation of its common stock to Class A common stock (the  Class A Shares ) and then reclassified a portion of its Class A Shares as Class T Shares pursuant to filings of Articles of Amendment ( Articles of Amendment ) and Articles Supplementary ( Articles Supplementary ) to the Company s Articles of Amendment and Restatement. All shares of common stock issued and outstanding prior to the filing on March 4, 2016 of the Articles of Amendment and the Articles Supplementary were designated as Class A Shares following the filing of the Articles of Amendment and the Articles Supplementary. The Class A Shares and Class T Shares have similar voting rights, although the amount of the distributions are expected to differ due to the distribution and stockholder servicing fees, as defined in the Company s charter, as amended, that are payable in connection with the Class T Shares. In addition, the Company s charter provides that, in the event of a liquidation of the Company s assets, distributions will be allocated between the share classes pursuant to the portion of the aggregate assets available for distribution to each class. Each holder of shares of a particular class of common stock will be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of shares of the same class, that portion of such

aggregate cash available for distribution as the number of outstanding shares of such class held by such holder to the total number of outstanding shares of such class then outstanding.  
  On March 29, 2016, the Board adopted an Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the  Amended and Restated DRIP  and collectively with the Original DRIP, the  DRIP ), to allow for the reinvestment of distributions paid on Class A Shares and Class T Shares. The Amended and Restated DRIP became effective as of May 1, 2016. 
  On April 11, 2016, the Company announced that the Board established an estimated per share net asset value ( NAV ) of the Company s common stock, as of February 29, 2016, of   $24.00   per share for purposes of assisting broker-dealers participating in the Offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. Commencing on April 11, 2016, the offering price for shares pursuant to the primary offering portion of the Offering reflects the   $24.00   estimated per share NAV plus selling commissions and dealer manager fees applicable to the class of shares being purchased. Commencing April 11, 2016, distributions are reinvested pursuant to the DRIP in shares of the Company s common stock at   $24.00   per share, the estimated per share NAV as determined by the Board. Pursuant to the terms of the Company s share redemption program, commencing on April 11, 2016, the estimated per share NAV of   $24.00   shall serve as the most recent estimated per share value for purposes of share redemptions. Going forward, the Company intends to publish an updated estimated per share NAV on at least an annual basis. 
  The Company intends to use substantially all of the net proceeds from the Offering to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments primarily consisting of necessity retail properties located throughout the United States. The retail properties primarily will be single tenant properties and multi-tenant  power centers  anchored by large, creditworthy national, regional or local retailers. The Company expects that the retail properties typically will be subject to long-term triple-net or double-net leases, which means the tenant will be obligated to pay for most of the expenses of maintaining the property. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   116   properties, comprising   2.5 million   rentable square feet of commercial space located in   31   states. As of   September 30, 2016  , the rentable square feet at these properties was   98.9%   leased, including month-to-month agreements, if any. 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements for the interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. Results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of full year results.  
  The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and related notes thereto set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should also be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Reclassifications  
  Certain amounts in the Company s prior period condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company has chosen to combine depreciation of   $2.2 million   and   $6.3 million   and amortization of   $1.0 million   and   $3.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, into the line item depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of operations. In addition, the Company has chosen to combine depreciation of   $6.3 million   and amortization of intangible lease assets and below-market lease intangibles, net of   $3.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, into the line item

     Table of Contents  
  COLE CREDIT PROPERTY TRUST V, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  September 30, 2016 

depreciation and amortization, net in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported totals or subtotals. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Real Estate Investments 
  Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Amounts capitalized to real estate assets consist of the cost of acquisition, construction and any tenant improvements, major improvements and betterments that extend the useful life of the real estate assets and leasing costs. All acquisition-related expenses, repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
  The Company considers the period of future benefit of each respective asset to determine the appropriate useful life. The estimated useful lives of the Company s real estate assets by class are generally as follows:                 Buildings 
    40 years 
      Tenant improvements 
    Lesser of useful life or lease term 
      Intangible lease assets 
    Lease term 

Recoverability of Real Estate Assets 
  The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate assets may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators that the Company considers include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy or other credit concerns of a property s major tenant, such as a history of late payments, rental concessions and other factors, a significant decrease in a property s revenues due to lease terminations, vacancies, co-tenancy clauses, reduced lease rates or other circumstances. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, the Company will adjust the real estate assets to their respective fair values and recognize an impairment loss. Generally, fair value will be determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and recent comparable sales transactions. No impairment indicators were identified and   no   impairment losses were recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Assets Held for Sale 
  When a real estate asset is identified by the Company as held for sale, the Company will cease depreciation and amortization of the assets related to the property and estimate the fair value, net of selling costs. If, in management s opinion, the fair value, net of selling costs, of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying amount would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property, net of selling costs. There were   no   assets identified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, the Company allocates the purchase price to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above- and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, based in each case on their respective fair values. Acquisition-related expenses are expensed as incurred. The Company utilizes independent appraisals to assist in the determination of the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and buildings). The information in the appraisal, along with any additional information available to the Company s management, is used in estimating the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to land. Other information in the appraisal, such as building value and market rents, may be used by the Company s management in estimating the allocation of purchase price to the building and to intangible lease assets and liabilities. The appraisal firm has no involvement in management s allocation decisions other than providing this market information.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  September 30, 2016 

The determination of the fair values of the real estate assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, capitalization and discount rates, interest rates and other variables. The use of alternative estimates may result in a different allocation of the Company s purchase price, which could materially impact the Company s results of operations. 
  Restricted Cash and Escrows 
  The Company had   $478,000   and   $354,000   in restricted cash as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Included in restricted cash were escrowed investor proceeds of   $40,000   and   $4,000   for which shares of common stock had not been issued as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Also included in restricted cash was   $438,000   and   $350,000   in lender cash management accounts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As part of certain debt agreements, rent from certain of the Company s tenants is deposited directly into a lockbox account, from which the monthly debt service payments are disbursed to the lender and the excess funds are disbursed to the Company. 
  Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fees 
  The Company pays CCC a distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. Through October 4, 2016, the daily amount of the distribution and stockholder servicing fee payable was calculated to equal 1/365th of 0.8% of the per share NAV of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. On October 5, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to its Amended and Restated Dealer Manager Agreement (the  Amended Dealer Manager Agreement ). Pursuant to the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, the calculation of the daily amount of distribution and stockholder servicing fee was changed to equal 1/365th of 1.0% of the per share NAV of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. The aggregate distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares will not exceed an amount equal to   4.0%   of the total gross offering proceeds of Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. 
  The distribution and stockholder servicing fee is paid monthly in arrears. An estimated liability for future distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable to CCC is recognized at the time each Class T Share is sold and included in due to affiliates in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Certain properties have leases where minimum rental payments increase during the term of the lease. The Company records rental income for the full term of each lease on a straight-line basis when earned and collectability is reasonably assured. When the Company acquires a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purpose of this calculation. The Company defers the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved. Expected reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses are included in tenant reimbursement income in the period when such costs are incurred. 
  The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent, including any unbilled straight-line rent, and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an allowance for uncollectible accounts of   $3,000  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have an allowance for uncollectible accounts. 
  Earnings per Share  
  We have   two   classes of common stock. Accordingly, we utilize the two-class method to determine our earnings per share, which results in different earnings per share for each of the classes. Under the two-class method, earnings per share of each class of common stock are computed by dividing the sum of the distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares for each class of common stock for the respective period. The distributed earnings to Class T Share common stockholders represents distributions declared less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees. Diluted income (loss) per share considers the effect of any potentially dilutive share equivalents, of which the Company had   none   for each of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     The requirements were amended to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and to provide a more complete framework for addressing revenue issues across a broad range of industries and transaction types. The revised standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised standard also clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract to a customer. These provisions are effective January 1, 2018, and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is in the process of evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, as the majority of the Company s revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts, as discussed in relation to ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), the Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 or related amendments and modifications issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on the Company s accounting and related reporting and disclosures in the Company s consolidated financial statements: 
  ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10)     The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income (loss), the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in this update require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the consolidated balance sheets or the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 840,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as either finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use ( ROU ) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and are required to be applied on a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. 
  ASU No. 2016-05,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships     The amendments in this update clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses   (Topic 326) ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other such commitments. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the Company to measure all expected credit losses based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets and eliminates the  incurred loss  methodology in current GAAP. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to address diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues as well as application of the predominance principle (dependence on predominant source or use of receipt or payment) and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  
   
  NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP emphasizes that fair value is intended to be a market-based measurement, as opposed to a transaction-specific measurement. 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate the fair value. Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy, as follows: 
  Level 1   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
  Level 2   Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs, which are only used to the extent that observable inputs are not available, reflect the Company s assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability. 
  The following describes the methods the Company uses to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities: 
  Credit facility, notes payable and line of credit with affiliate     The fair value is estimated by discounting the expected cash flows based on estimated borrowing rates available to the Company as of the measurement date. Current and prior period liabilities  carrying and fair values exclude net deferred financing costs. These financial instruments are valued using Level 2 inputs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the Company s debt was   $261.9 million  , compared to the carrying value of   $257.4 million  . The estimated fair value of the Company s debt was   $290.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , compared to the carrying value on that date of   $289.3 million  .  
  Derivative instruments     The Company s derivative instruments are comprised of interest rate swaps. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value and are valued using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of these instruments is determined using interest rate market pricing models. In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company s potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the respective counterparties. 
  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company s derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Other financial instruments           The Company considers the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable in order to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between their origination and their expected realization as well as their highly-liquid nature. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, Level 1 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments.

NOTE 4   REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS 
  2016 Property Acquisitions 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   four   commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $27.6 million   (the    2016   Acquisitions ). The Company purchased the   2016   Acquisitions with net proceeds from the Offering and available borrowings. The purchase price allocation for each of the Company s acquisitions is preliminary and subject to change as the Company finalizes the allocation, which the Company expects will be prior to the end of the current fiscal year. The Company preliminarily allocated the purchase price of these properties to the fair value of the assets acquired. The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation for acquisitions purchased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
  In the normal course of business, the Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing or hedging its interest rate risk. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into   one   interest rate swap agreement, and as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   interest rate swap agreements. The following table summarizes the terms of the Company s executed interest rate swap agreements designated as hedging instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

______________________ 
  (1)  The interest rates consist of the underlying index swapped to a fixed rate and the applicable interest rate spread as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Additional disclosures related to the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments are included in Note 3   Fair Value Measurements. The notional amount under the interest rate swap agreements is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in each instrument, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks.  
  Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in order to hedge the variability of the anticipated cash flows on its variable rate debt. The change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instruments that are designated as hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), with a portion of the amount subsequently reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable rate debt. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the amounts reclassified were   $377,000   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. No amounts were reclassified for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in interest expense. There were no portions of the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps that were considered ineffective during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional   $1.2 million   will be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) as an increase to interest expense. 
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions whereby, if the Company defaults on certain of its unsecured indebtedness, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations, resulting in an acceleration of payment. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of   September 30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under these agreements at an aggregate termination value, inclusive of interest payments and accrued interest, of   $2.7 million  . In addition, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The Company records credit risk valuation adjustments on its interest rate swaps based on the credit quality of the Company and the respective counterparty. There were no termination events or events of default related to the interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 6   NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT FACILITY 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $255.9 million   of debt outstanding, including net deferred financing costs, with weighted average years to maturity of   3.3   years and a weighted average interest rate of   4.27%  . The following table summarizes the debt balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the debt activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   (in thousands):   

  ______________________ 
  (1) Includes deferred financing costs incurred during the period. 
  (2) Net premiums on mortgage notes payable were recorded upon the assumption of the respective debt instruments. Amortization of these net premiums is recorded as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective debt instruments using the effective-interest method. 
  (3) Deferred costs relate to mortgage notes payable and the term portion of the credit facility. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fixed rate debt outstanding of   $135.4 million   included mortgage notes assumed with a face amount of   $42.8 million   and a fair value of   $43.7 million   at the date of assumption and   $21.1 million   of variable rate debt that is fixed through interest rate swap agreements, which has the effect of fixing the variable interest rate per annum through the maturity date of the variable rate debt. The fixed rate debt has interest rates ranging from   3.49%   to   5.66%   per annum. The debt outstanding matures on various dates from April 2017 to December 2024. The aggregate balance of gross real estate assets, net of gross intangible lease liabilities, securing the fixed rate debt outstanding was   $208.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Each of the mortgage notes payable comprising the fixed rate debt is secured by the respective properties on which the debt was placed. 
  The Company has a modified credit agreement (the  Modified Credit Agreement ), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan Chase ) as administrative agent. The Modified Credit Agreement reduced the revolving loans (the  Revolving Loans ) under the original credit agreement from   $300.0 million   to   $180.0 million  , and added a term loan (the  Term Loan , and together with the Revolving Loan, the  Credit Facility ) in the amount of   $120.0 million   for a total capacity of   $300.0 million   under the Credit Facility. The Revolving Loans mature on April 25, 2017; however, the Company may elect to extend the maturity date of certain loans to April 25, 2019 subject to satisfying certain conditions described in the Modified Credit Agreement. The Term Loan matures on April 25, 2019.  
  Depending upon the type of loan specified and overall leverage ratio, the Credit Facility bears interest at (i) the one-month, two-month, three-month or six-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) multiplied by the statutory reserve rate (the  Eurodollar Rate ) plus an interest rate spread ranging from   1.90%   to   2.45%  , depending on the Company s leverage ratio (as defined in the Modified Credit Agreement); or (ii) a base rate ranging from   0.90%   to   1.45%  , depending on the Company s leverage ratio (as defined in the Modified Credit Agreement), plus the greatest of: (a) JPMorgan Chase s Prime Rate (as defined in the Modified Credit Agreement); (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Modified Credit Agreement) plus   0.50%  ; or (c) one-month LIBOR plus   1.0%   multiplied by the statutory reserve rate. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount outstanding under the Revolving Loans totaled   $2.0 million   at an interest rate of   2.97%  , and the amount outstanding under the Term Loan totaled   $120.0 million  , which was subject to an interest rate swap agreement (the  Swapped Term Loan ). The interest rate swap agreement had the effect of fixing the Eurodollar Rate per annum beginning on December 31, 2015 through the maturity date of the Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the all-in rate for the Swapped Term Loan was   4.02%  . The Company had   $122.0 million   of debt outstanding under the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016   at a weighted average interest rate of   4.00%   and   $178.0 million   in unused capacity, subject to borrowing availability.

The Modified Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including minimum net worth, debt service coverage and leverage ratio requirements, maximum variable rate, recourse debt requirements and dividend payout requirements. In particular, the Modified Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than   1.50  , as well as a minimum consolidated net worth not less than   $150.0 million   plus   75%   of the equity interests issued by the Company. The Company believes it was in compliance with the covenants of the Modified Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In addition, the Company previously had   $20.0 million   outstanding on its   $60.0 million   subordinate line of credit with an affiliate of the Company s advisor (the  Series C Loan ), which was repaid in full on its maturity date of March 17, 2016. The Series C Loan was approved by a majority of the Company s board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to the Company than a comparable loan between unaffiliated parties under the same circumstances. 
   
  NOTE 7   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Litigation 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation and claims. The Company is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company s business, to which the Company is a party or of which the Company s properties are the subject. 
  Purchase Commitments  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had entered into a purchase agreement with an unaffiliated third-party seller to acquire a   100%   interest in   one   single-tenant retail property, subject to meeting certain criteria, for a purchase price of   $9.7 million  , exclusive of closing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a   $284,000   property escrow deposit held by an escrow agent in connection with this future property acquisition. This deposit is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets in prepaid expenses, property escrow deposit and other assets and could be forfeited under certain circumstances. As of   September 30, 2016  , the escrow deposit had not been forfeited.  
  Environmental Matters 
  In connection with the ownership and operation of real estate, the Company may potentially be liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. In addition, the Company may own or acquire certain properties that are subject to environmental remediation. Generally, the seller of the property, the tenant of the property and/or another third party is responsible for environmental remediation costs related to a property. Additionally, in connection with the purchase of certain properties, the respective sellers and/or tenants may agree to indemnify the Company against future remediation costs. The Company also carries environmental liability insurance on its properties that provides limited coverage for any remediation liability and/or pollution liability for third-party bodily injury and/or property damage claims for which the Company may be liable.  The Company is not aware of any environmental matters which it believes are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
   
  NOTE 8   RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS 
  The Company has incurred commissions, fees and expenses payable to CR V Advisors and certain of its affiliates in connection with the Offering and the acquisition, management and disposition of its assets. 
  Selling commissions and dealer manager fees 
  In connection with the Offering, CCC, the Company s dealer manager, which is affiliated with CR V Advisors, receives selling commissions of up to   7.0%   and   3.0%   of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of the Offering for Class A Shares and Class T Shares, respectively, and before reallowance of selling commissions earned by participating broker-dealers. The Company has been advised that CCC intends to reallow   100%   of selling commissions earned to participating broker-dealers. In addition, CCC receives up to   2.0%   of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of the Offering for both Class A Shares and Class T Shares as a dealer manager fee in connection with the primary portion of the Offering. CCC, in its sole discretion, may reallow all or a portion of its dealer manager fee to participating broker-dealers. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees are paid to CCC or other participating broker-dealers with respect to shares sold pursuant to the DRIP.

Other organization and offering expenses 
  All other organization and offering expenses associated with the sale of the Company s common stock (excluding selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees) are paid by CR V Advisors or its affiliates and are reimbursed by the Company up to   2.0%   of aggregate gross offering proceeds. A portion of the other organization and offering expenses may be considered to be underwriting compensation. As of   September 30, 2016  , CR V Advisors had paid organization and offering expenses in excess of   2.0%   of aggregate gross offering proceeds in connection with the Offering. These excess amounts were not included in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements of the Company because such amounts were not a liability of the Company as they exceeded   2.0%   of gross proceeds from the Offering. As the Company raises additional proceeds from the Offering, these excess amounts may become payable. 
  Distribution and stockholder servicing fees 
  Through October 4, 2016, the Company paid CCC a distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares that is calculated on a daily basis in the amount of 1/365th of 0.8% of the per share NAV of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. Pursuant to the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, beginning on October 5, 2016, the distribution and stockholder servicing fee will be calculated on a daily basis in an amount equal to 1/365th of 1.0% of the per share NAV of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. The maximum amount of distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable has not changed pursuant to the provisions of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement. The distribution and stockholder servicing fee is paid monthly in arrears from cash flow from operations or, if the Company s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to pay the distribution and stockholder servicing fee, from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow. An estimated liability for future distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable to CCC is recognized at the time each Class T Share is sold and included in due to affiliates in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value. The Company will cease paying the distribution and stockholder servicing fee with respect to Class T Shares at the earliest of (i) the end of the month in which the total distribution and stockholder servicing fees paid by a stockholder within his or her individual account would be equal to   4.0%   of the stockholder s total gross investment amount at the time of the purchase of the primary Class T Shares held in such account; (ii) the date on which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals   10.0%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Company s shares in the Offering, excluding shares sold pursuant to the DRIP; (iii) the fourth anniversary of the last day of the month in which the Offering (excluding the offering of shares pursuant to the DRIP) terminates; (iv) the date such Class T Share is no longer outstanding; and (v) the date the Company effects a liquidity event. CCC may, in its discretion, reallow to participating broker-dealers all or a portion of the distribution and stockholder servicing fee for services that such participating broker-dealers perform. No distribution and stockholder servicing fees are paid to CCC or other participating broker-dealers with respect to shares sold pursuant to the DRIP. 
  Acquisition fees and expenses 
  The Company pays CR V Advisors or its affiliates acquisition fees of up to   2.0%   of: (1) the contract purchase price of each property or asset the Company acquires; (2) the amount paid in respect of the development, construction or improvement of each asset the Company acquires; (3) the purchase price of any loan the Company acquires; and (4) the principal amount of any loan the Company originates. In addition, the Company reimburses CR V Advisors or its affiliates for insourced expenses incurred in the process of acquiring a property or the origination or acquisition of a loan, which are fixed on an annual basis to   0.5%   of the contract purchase price of each property and   0.5%   of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment, which will be prorated for any partial calendar year. Additionally, CR V Advisors or its affiliates are reimbursed for third-party acquisition-related expenses incurred in the process of acquiring properties, so long as the total acquisition fees and expenses relating to the transaction do not exceed   6.0%   of the contract purchase price. 
  Advisory fees and expenses 
  Pursuant to the advisory agreement with CR V Advisors, the Company pays CR V Advisors a monthly advisory fee based upon the Company s monthly average invested assets, which, effective March 1, 2016, is based on the estimated market value of the Company s real estate assets used to determine the Company s per share NAV, as discussed in Note 1   Organization and Business, and for those assets acquired subsequent to March 1, 2016, is based on the purchase price. The monthly advisory fee is equal to the following amounts: (1) an annualized rate of   0.75%   paid on the Company s average invested assets that are between   $0   to   $2.0 billion  ; (2) an annualized rate of   0.70%   paid on the Company s average invested assets that are between   $2.0 billion   and   $4.0 billion  ; and (3) an annualized rate of   0.65%   paid on the Company s average invested assets that are over   $4.0 billion  .

  If CR V Advisors or its affiliates provide a substantial amount of services (as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors) in connection with the sale of one or more properties (or the Company s entire portfolio), the Company will pay CR V Advisors or its affiliates a disposition fee in an amount equal to up to one-half of the real estate or brokerage commission paid by the Company to third parties on the sale of such properties, not to exceed   1.0%   of the contract price of the properties sold; provided, however, in no event may the total disposition fees paid to CR V Advisors, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed the lesser of the customary competitive real estate commission or an amount equal to   6.0%   of the contract sales price. In addition, if CR V Advisors or its affiliates provides a substantial amount of services (as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors) in connection with the sale of one or more assets other than properties, the Company may separately compensate CR V Advisors or its affiliates at such rates and in such amounts as the Board, including a majority of the Company s independent directors, and CR V Advisors agree upon, not to exceed an amount equal to   1.0%   of the contract price of the assets sold. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   disposition fees were incurred for any such services provided by CR V Advisors or its affiliates.  
  Subordinated performance fees 
  The Company will pay a subordinated performance fee in connection with one of the following alternative events: (1) if the Company s shares are listed on a national securities exchange, CR V Advisors, or its affiliates, will be entitled to a subordinated performance fee equal to   15.0%   of the amount, if any, by which (i) the market value of the Company s outstanding stock plus distributions paid by the Company prior to listing, exceeds (ii) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from investors and the amount of distributions necessary to generate a   6.0%   annual cumulative, non-compounded return to investors; (2) if the Company is sold or its assets are liquidated, CR V Advisors will be entitled to a subordinated performance fee equal to   15.0%   of the net sale proceeds remaining after investors have received, from regular distributions plus special distributions paid from proceeds of such sale, a return of their net capital invested and a   6.0%   annual cumulative, non-compounded return; or (3) upon termination of the advisory agreement, CR V Advisors may be entitled to a subordinated performance fee similar to the fee to which it would have been entitled had the portfolio been liquidated (based on an independent appraised value of the portfolio) on the date of termination. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, no subordinated performance fees were incurred related to any such events.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc., other than historical facts, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable by law. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   would,   could,   should,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue  or other similar words. Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our management s view only as of the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Additionally, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results. The forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risk factors identified in Item 1A   Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The following are some, but not all, of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all. 
                
    We are subject to risks associated with tenant, geographic and industry concentrations with respect to our properties. 
                
    Our properties, intangible assets and other assets may be subject to impairment charges. 
                
    We could be subject to unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from potential dispositions and may be unable to dispose of properties on advantageous terms. 
                
    We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties and we may be unable to acquire, dispose of, or lease properties on advantageous terms. 
                
    We could be subject to risks associated with bankruptcies or insolvencies of tenants or from tenant defaults generally. 
                
    We have substantial indebtedness, which may affect our ability to pay distributions, and expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and the risk of default under our debt obligations. 
                
    We may be affected by the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt. 
                
    We may not be able to maintain profitability. 
                
    We may not generate cash flows sufficient to pay our distributions to stockholders or meet our debt service obligations.  
                
    We may be affected by risks resulting from losses in excess of insured limits.  
                
    We may fail to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
                
    Our sponsor may be unable to fully reestablish the financial network which previously supported us and/or regain the prior level of transaction and capital raising volume. 
                
    We are subject to risks that may affect capital raising volume as a result of increased regulatory changes. 
                
    Our advisor has the right to terminate the advisory agreement upon 60 days  written notice without cause or penalty.

     Table of Contents  

Definitions 
  We use certain defined terms throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have the following meanings: 
  The phrase  annualized rental income  refers to the straight line rental revenue under our leases on operating properties owned as of the respective reporting date, which includes the effect of rent escalations and any tenant concessions, such as free rent, and excludes any bad debt allowances and any contingent rent, such as percentage rent. Management uses annualized rental income as a basis for tenant, industry and geographic concentrations and other metrics within the portfolio. Annualized rental income is not indicative of future performance. 
  Under a  net lease,  the tenant occupying the leased property (usually as a single tenant) does so in much the same manner as if the tenant were the owner of the property. There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as triple net or double net. Triple net leases typically require the tenant to pay all expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs). Double net leases typically require that the tenant pay all operating expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance), but excludes some or all major repairs (e.g., roof, structure and parking lot). Accordingly, the owner receives the rent  net  of these expenses, rendering the cash flow associated with the lease predictable for the term of the lease. Under a net lease, the tenant generally agrees to lease the property for a significant term and agrees that it will either have no ability or only limited ability to terminate the lease or abate rent prior to the expiration of the term of the lease as a result of real estate driven events such as casualty, condemnation or failure by the landlord to fulfill its obligations under the lease. 
   
  Overview   
  We were formed on   December 12, 2012  , and we elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We commenced principal operations on   March 18, 2014  , when we satisfied the minimum offering conditions of our escrow agreement and issued approximately 110,000 shares of our common stock in the Offering. We have no paid employees and are externally advised and managed by CR V Advisors. VEREIT indirectly owns and/or controls CR V Advisors, our dealer manager, CCC, our property manager, CREI Advisors, and our sponsor, Cole Capital.  
  As we acquire additional commercial real estate, we will be subject to changes in real estate prices and changes in interest rates on any current variable rate debt, refinancings or new indebtedness used to acquire the properties. We may manage our risk of changes in real estate prices on future property acquisitions, when applicable, by entering into purchase agreements and loan commitments simultaneously, or through loan assumptions, so that our operating yield is determinable at the time we enter into a purchase agreement, by contracting with developers for future delivery of properties or by entering into sale-leaseback transactions. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate environment in connection with our future property acquisitions, when applicable, or upcoming debt maturities to determine the appropriate financing or refinancing terms, which may include fixed rate loans, variable rate loans or interest rate hedges. If we are unable to acquire suitable properties or obtain suitable financing terms for future acquisitions or refinancing, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
  Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by rental income from our commercial properties, interest expense on our indebtedness and acquisition and operating expenses. Rental and other property income accounted for   89%   and   92%   of our total revenue for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   88%   and   91%   of our total revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As   98.9%   of our rentable square feet was under lease as of   September 30, 2016   (including any month-to-month agreements) with a weighted average remaining lease term of   11.0   years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors. Our advisor regularly monitors the creditworthiness of each of our tenants by reviewing the tenant s financial results, credit rating agency reports, when available, on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant s industry segment and other information for changes and possible trends. If our advisor identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant s financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property, or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease.

Portfolio Information 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   116   properties, comprising   2.5 million   rentable square feet of commercial space located in   31   states, which were   98.9%   leased (including any month-to-month agreements) with a weighted average lease term remaining of   11.0   years. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   two   of our tenants accounted for   18%   and   11%  , respectively, of our   2016   annualized rental income. We also had certain geographic concentrations in our property holdings. In particular, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   eight   of our properties were located in   Texas   and   13   were located in   California  , each of which accounted for   11%   of our   2016   annualized rental income, and   nine   properties were located in   Indiana   and   seven   were located in   Louisiana  , each of which accounted for   10%   of our   2016   annualized rental income. In addition, we had tenants in the   drugstore  ,   discount store  ,   gas and convenience  , and   sporting goods   industries, which accounted for   19%  ,   16%  ,   11%   and   10%  , respectively, of our   2016   annualized rental income.

Revenue 
  Our revenue consists primarily of rental and other property income from net leased commercial properties. We also pay certain operating expenses subject to reimbursement by our tenants, which results in tenant reimbursement income. 
  The   increase   in revenue of   $897,000   and   $4.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was primarily due to the acquisition and management of   five   income-producing properties subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . Rental and other property income accounted for   89%   and   92%   of our total revenue for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   88%   and   91%   of our total revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We also paid certain operating expenses subject to reimbursement by our tenants, which resulted in   $1.1 million   and   $3.7 million   in tenant reimbursement income during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $767,000   and   $2.2 million   during the same periods in   2015  .  
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  The primary general and administrative expense items are escrow and trustee fees, state franchise and income taxes, operating expense reimbursements to our advisor and accounting fees. 
  The   increase   in general and administrative expenses of   $42,000   and   $733,000   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was primarily due to increased operating expense reimbursements to our advisor as a result of certain expense allocations performed on a quarterly basis.  No such allocation was made during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as the allocation was performed on an annual basis during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   
  Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses such as property repairs, maintenance and property-related insurance include both reimbursable and non-reimbursable property expenses. We are reimbursed by tenants for reimbursable property operating expenses in accordance with the respective lease agreements. 
  The   increase   in property operating expenses of   $65,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to owning   116   properties for the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to owning   109   properties for the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and purchasing   two   additional properties during such period.  
  The   increase   in property operating expenses of   $307,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to owning   112   properties for the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and purchasing   four   additional properties during such period, compared to owning   79   properties for the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and purchasing   32   additional properties during such period. 
  Real Estate Tax Expense 
  The   increase   in real estate tax expense of   $371,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to owning   116   properties for the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to owning   109   properties for the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and acquiring   two   additional properties during such period.  
  The   increase   in real estate tax expense of   $1.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to owning   112   properties for the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and purchasing   four   additional properties during such period, as compared to owning   79   properties for the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and acquiring   32   additional properties during such period. 
  Advisory Fees and Expenses 
  Pursuant to the advisory agreement with CR V Advisors and based upon the amount of our current invested assets, we are required to pay to CR V Advisors a monthly advisory fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the average invested assets. Additionally, we may be required to reimburse certain expenses incurred by CR V Advisors in providing such advisory services, subject to limitations as set forth in the advisory agreement. 
  The   increase   in advisory fees and expenses of   $228,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to an increase in our average invested assets to   $541.2 million   over the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $460.3 million   over the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .

The   increase   in advisory fees and expenses of   $767,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to an increase in our average invested assets to   $526.0 million   over the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $436.0 million   over the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Acquisition-Related Expenses  
  Acquisition-related expenses primarily consisted of legal, deed transfer and other costs related to real estate purchase transactions, including costs incurred for deals that were not consummated. 
  The   decrease   in acquisition-related expenses of   $509,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to no acquisitions of commercial properties during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the purchase of   two   commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $14.0 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  The   decrease   in acquisition-related expenses of   $1.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to the acquisition of   four   commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $27.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the purchase of   32   commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $84.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
  The   increase   in depreciation and amortization expenses of   $153,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to owning   116   properties for the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to owning   109   properties during the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and purchasing   two   additional properties during such period.  
  The   increase   in depreciation and amortization expenses of   $768,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to owning   112   properties for the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and purchasing   four   additional properties during such period, compared to owning   79   properties during the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and purchasing   32   additional properties during such period.  
  Interest Expense and Other, Net 
  The   increase   in interest expense and other, net of   $88,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to costs incurred related to our interest rate swap agreements entered into subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , partially offset by a decrease in the average aggregate amount of debt outstanding to   $267.1 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $306.7 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  The   increase   in interest expense and other, net of   $1.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to costs incurred related to our interest rate swap agreements entered into subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , partially offset by a decrease in the average aggregate amount of debt outstanding to   $273.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $279.0 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Same Store Properties 
  We review our stabilized operating results, measured by contract rental revenue, from properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods, referred to as  same store  properties. Contract rental revenue is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies  operating performance. Contract rental revenue is considered by management to be a helpful supplemental performance measure, as it provides a consistent method for the comparison of our properties. In determining the same store property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods.

Non-same store  properties, as reflected in the table below, includes properties acquired on or after July 1, 2015. As shown in the table below, contract rental revenue on the   109   same store properties for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $72,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The same store properties were   98.8%   occupied as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   99.1%   occupied as of   September 30, 2015  . The following table shows the contract rental revenue from properties owned for both of the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with a reconciliation to rental income, calculated in accordance with GAAP (dollar amounts in thousands):

   Non-same store  properties, as reflected in the table below, includes properties acquired on or after January 1, 2015. As shown in the table below, contract rental revenue on the   79   same store properties for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   $74,000   to   $20.2 million  , compared to   $20.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The expiration of a rent abatement period for one same store property accounted for $124,000 of contract rental revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The same store properties were   98.9%   occupied as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   99.2%   occupied as of   September 30, 2015  .

  Distributions 
  Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution, based on 366 days in the calendar year, of $0.0043032787 per Class A Share for stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2016. Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution on Class T Shares to our stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on the date that the first Class T Share was sold in the Offering and ending on December 31, 2016, equal to $0.0043032787 per Class T Share, less the per share distribution and stockholder servicing fees that are payable with respect to the Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). As of   September 30, 2016  , we had distributions payable of   $1.5 million  . 
  In addition, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution, based on 365 days in the calendar year, of $0.004315068 per Class A Share for stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017. Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution on Class T Shares to our stockholders of record of such class of shares as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing

on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017, equal to $0.004315068 per Class T Share, less the per share distribution and stockholder servicing fees that are payable with respect to the Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid distributions of   $12.3 million   and   $8.9 million  , respectively, including   $6.3 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively, through the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP. Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $9.7 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively, and reflected a reduction for real estate acquisition-related expenses incurred of   $1.3 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively. We treat our real estate acquisition-related expenses as funded by proceeds from the Offering, including proceeds from the DRIP. Therefore, for consistency, proceeds from the issuance of common stock used as a source of distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes the amount by which real estate acquisition-related expenses have reduced net cash flows from operating activities of   $1.3 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively. Our distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were funded by cash flows from operations of   $9.7 million  , or   78%  , and proceeds from the Offering of   $2.6 million  , or   22%  , including proceeds from prior periods. Our distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were funded by cash flows from operations of   $7.5 million  , or   84%  , and proceeds from the Offering of   $1.4 million  , or   16%  . 
  Share Redemptions 
  Our share redemption program permits our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We may waive the one-year holding period upon request in the event of death, bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances as determined by our advisor. In addition, the Board may choose to amend the terms of, suspend or terminate our share redemption program at any time upon 30 days  notice. We will not redeem in excess of 5.0% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid. Funding for the redemption of shares will be limited to the cumulative net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares under the DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date. In addition, we will generally limit quarterly redemptions to approximately 1.25% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid, and to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares in the respective quarter under the DRIP. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we received valid redemption requests under our share redemption program totaling approximately   133,000   shares, of which we redeemed approximately   83,000   shares as of   September 30, 2016   for   $2.0 million   at an average redemption price of   $23.90   per share and approximately   50,000   shares subsequent to   September 30, 2016   for   $1.2 million   at an average redemption price of   $23.58   per share. A valid redemption request is one that complies with the applicable requirements and guidelines of our current share redemption program. The share redemptions were funded with proceeds from the DRIP. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
  We expect to utilize funds from the Offering and future proceeds from secured or unsecured financing to complete future property acquisitions and for general corporate uses. Our operating cash flows will primarily be provided by the rental income received from leased properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had raised   $297.6 million   of gross proceeds from the Offering (  $294.6 million   in Class A Shares and   $3.0 million   in Class T Shares) before organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees of   $30.1 million  . 
  Our Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent provides for borrowings of up to $300.0 million, which includes a $120.0 million unsecured Term Loan and up to $180.0 million in unsecured Revolving Loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $178.0 million   in unused capacity under the Credit Facility, subject to borrowing availability. As of   September 30, 2016  , we also had cash and cash equivalents of   $3.0 million  .  
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We expect our operating cash flows to increase as we continue to acquire properties. On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by operations and proceeds from the Offering, as well as secured or unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders to finance our future acquisitions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.0 million   outstanding under the Revolving Loans and   $42.8 million   of fixed rate debt due in less than one year. The Revolving Loans mature on April 25, 2017; however, we may elect to extend the maturity date of certain loans to April 25, 2019 subject to satisfying certain conditions described in the Modified Credit Agreement. As a result,  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

we believe that the resources stated above will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from sources other than those described above within the next 12 months.  
  All organization and offering expenses (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) are paid for by CR V Advisors or its affiliates and are reimbursed by us up to   2.0%   of aggregate gross proceeds. A portion of the other organization and offering expenses may be underwriting compensation. As of   September 30, 2016  , CR V Advisors had paid organization and offering expenses in excess of   2.0%   of aggregate gross offering proceeds. The amounts in excess of 2.0% of aggregate gross offering proceeds were not included in our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements because such amounts were not a liability of ours as they exceeded   2.0%   of proceeds from the Offering. As we raise additional proceeds from the Offering, these excess amounts may become payable. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of tenant improvements, acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions and redemptions to stockholders and interest and principal on any current and future indebtedness. Generally, we expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from the sale of our common stock, proceeds from secured or unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders and net cash flows provided by operations. 
  We expect that substantially all net cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, are paid; however, we may use other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, including proceeds from the Offering, borrowings on our Credit Facility and/or future borrowings on unencumbered assets. To the extent that cash flows from operations are lower due to fewer properties being acquired or lower than expected returns on the properties, distributions paid to our stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from the Offering or debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions to our stockholders. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $257.4 million   of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   4.27%  . See Note 6   Notes Payable and Credit Facility to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for certain terms of our debt outstanding. 
  Our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

______________________ 
           (1) 
    The table does not include amounts due to CR V Advisors or its affiliates pursuant to our advisory agreement because such amounts are not fixed and determinable. 
              (2) 
    Payment obligations for the Revolving Loans outstanding under the Credit Facility are based on the weighted average interest rate in effect as of   September 30, 2016   of   2.97%  . Additionally, we executed a swap agreement associated with the Term Loan, which had the effect of fixing the variable interest rate per annum beginning on December 31, 2015 through the maturity date of the loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate was   4.02%  . 
              (3) 
    Principal payment amounts reflect actual payments based on the face amount of notes payable that are secured by our wholly-owned properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value adjustment, net of accretion, of mortgage notes assumed was   $211,000   and deferred financing costs, net of amortization, of mortgage notes assumed were   $788,000  . 
              (4) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $21.1 million   of variable rate debt effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. We used the effective interest rates fixed under our interest rate swap agreements to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods.

We expect to incur additional borrowings in the future to acquire additional properties and make other real estate-related investments. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property. Our borrowings will not exceed 75% of the cost of our gross assets (or 300% of net assets) as of the date of any borrowing, which is the maximum level of indebtedness permitted under the North American Securities Administrators Association REIT Guidelines; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors. Our board of directors has adopted a policy to further limit our borrowings to 60% of the greater of cost (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our gross assets, unless the excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in the next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess borrowing. A majority of our board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) determined that, as a general policy, borrowing in excess of 60% of the greater of cost (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our gross assets is justified and in the best interests of us and our stockholders during our capital raising stage. As of   September 30, 2016  , our ratio of debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was   51.6%  .  
  Our management reviews net debt as part of its management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage, and we therefore believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure used to show our outstanding principal debt balance, excluding certain GAAP adjustments, such as premiums or discounts, less all cash and cash equivalents. As of   September 30, 2016  , our net debt leverage ratio, which is the ratio of net debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities, was   51.0%  . The following table provides a reconciliation of the credit facility and notes payable, net balance, as reported on our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet, to net debt as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

  (1) Net of gross intangible lease liabilities. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had entered into a purchase agreement with an unaffiliated third-party seller to acquire a   100%   interest in   one   single-tenant retail property, subject to meeting certain criteria, for a purchase price of   $9.7 million  , exclusive of closing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $284,000   of property escrow deposits held by escrow agents in connection with this future property acquisition. This deposit is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets in prepaid expenses, property escrow deposit and other assets and could be forfeited under certain circumstances. As of   September 30, 2016  , the escrow deposit had not been forfeited. 
   
  Cash Flow Analysis 
  Operating Activities.   Net cash   provided by   operating activities increased by   $2.2 million   to   $9.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of   $766,000  , a decrease in net loss of   $868,000  , and a net increase in working capital accounts of   $440,000  . See    Results of Operations  for a more complete discussion of the factors impacting our operating performance. 
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities decreased by   $57.9 million   to   $28.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $86.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease resulted primarily from the purchase of   four   properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $27.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the purchase of   32   properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $84.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Financing Activities.   Net cash   provided by   financing activities decreased   $76.7 million   to   $11.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $88.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, notes payable and line of credit with affiliates of   $95.9 million   offset by an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of   $21.3 million  .

Election as a REIT 
  We elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain requirements relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets, distributions of income to our stockholders and recordkeeping. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders so long as we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains). 
  If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any reason in a taxable year and applicable relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We will not be able to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also will be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. No provision for federal income taxes has been made in our accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. We are subject to certain state and local taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, which have been provided for in our accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . We consider our critical accounting policies to be the following: 
             
    Recoverability of Real Estate Assets; 
                
    Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets; and 
                
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
     A complete description of such policies and our considerations is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and related notes thereto. 
   
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  We have entered into agreements with CR V Advisors and its affiliates whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, CR V Advisors or its affiliates such as acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and expenses, distribution and stockholder servicing fees, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. See Note 8   Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.

Conflicts of Interest 
  Affiliates of CR V Advisors act as an advisor to, and our chief financial officer and our chief executive officer act as executive officers and/or a director of Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc., Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc., Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc., Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc., and/or other real estate offerings in registration, all of which are public, non-traded REITs offered, distributed and/or managed by affiliates of CR V Advisors. As such, there are conflicts of interest where CR V Advisors or its affiliates, while serving in the capacity as sponsor, general partner, officer, director, key personnel and/or advisor for VEREIT or another real estate program sponsored by Cole Capital, including other real estate offerings in registration, may be in conflict with us in connection with providing services to other real estate-related programs related to property acquisitions, property dispositions, and property management among others. The compensation arrangements between affiliates of CR V Advisors and VEREIT and these other real estate programs sponsored by Cole Capital could influence the advice provided to us.

  Market Risk 
  The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable-rate borrowings. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to manage our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate balance of   $2.0 million   of variable rate debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, excluding any debt subject to interest rate swap agreements, and therefore, we are exposed to interest rate changes in LIBOR. As of   September 30, 2016  , an increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of   $10,000   per annum. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   two   interest rate swap agreements outstanding, which mature on   April 25, 2019   and   February 1, 2021   with an aggregate notional amount of   $141.1 million   and an aggregate fair value loss of   $2.7 million  . The fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads. As of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   50   basis points in interest rates would result in a derivative liability of   $776,000  , representing a   $1.9 million   net change to the fair value of the net derivative liability. A decrease of   50   basis points would result in a derivative liability of   $4.6 million  , representing a   $1.9 million   net change to the fair value of the net derivative liability. 
  As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of   September 30, 2016  , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date. The information presented herein has limited predictive value. Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations. 
  These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on our borrowing costs and assume no other changes in our capital structure. 
  Credit Risk 
  Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. We are subject to tenant, geographic and industry concentrations. Any downturn of the economic conditions in one or more of these tenants, states or industries could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to us.  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (  i.e.  , expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We believe that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants  risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. 
   
           Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that no controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
  As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of   September 30, 2016   was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d -15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     In the ordinary course of business we may become subject to litigation or claims. We are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which we are a party or to which our properties are the subject.  
           Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in real estate and may negatively impact the value of your investment.  
  To the extent   that   cash flow from operations has been or is insufficient to fully cover our distributions to our stockholders, we have paid, and may continue to pay, some of our distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations. Such sources may include borrowings, proceeds from asset sales or the sale of our securities in the Offering or future offerings. We have no limits on the amounts we may pay from sources other than cash flow from operations. The payment of distributions from sources other than cash provided by operating activities may     reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds, and may cause subsequent investors to experience dilution. This may negatively impact the value of your investment in our common stock.    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid distributions of   $12.3 million  , including   $6.3 million   through the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP. Our net loss was   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid distributions of $12.2 million, including $6.7 million through the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP. Our net loss was $14.2 million as of December 31, 2015, cumulative since inception.  
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $9.7 million   and reflected a reduction for real estate acquisition-related expenses incurred of   $1.3 million   in accordance with GAAP. We treat our real estate acquisition-related expenses as funded by proceeds from the Offering, including proceeds from the DRIP. Therefore, for consistency, proceeds from the issuance of common stock used as a source of distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes the amount by which real estate acquisition-related expenses have reduced net cash flows from operating activities of   $1.3 million  . Our distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were funded by cash flows from operations of   $9.7 million  , or   78%  , and proceeds from the Offering of   $2.6 million  , or   22%  , including proceeds from prior periods. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.8 million and reflected a reduction for real estate acquisition-related expenses incurred of $3.0 million, in accordance with GAAP. The distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015, including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were funded by cash flows from operations of $9.8 million, or 80%, and proceeds from the Offering of $2.4 million, or 20%. 
   
           Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued approximately   11.9 million   shares of our common stock in the Offering for gross offering proceeds of   $297.6 million  , out of which we incurred   $23.9 million   in selling commissions and dealer manager fees and   $6.0 million   in organization and offering costs payable to CR V Advisors or its affiliates. In addition, we pay CCC a distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. Through October 4, 2016, we paid a distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T shares that was calculated on a daily basis in the amount of 1/365th of 0.8% of the per share NAV of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. Pursuant to the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, beginning on October 5, 2016, the distribution and stockholder servicing fee will be calculated on a daily basis in an amount equal to 1/365th of 1.0% of the per share NAV of the Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. The aggregate distribution and stockholder servicing fee for Class T Shares will not exceed an amount equal to   4.0%   of the total gross offering proceeds of Class T Shares sold in the primary portion of the Offering. We have excluded the distribution and stockholder servicing fee from the above information, as we pay the distribution and stockholder servicing fee from cash flow from operations or, if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to pay the distribution and stockholder servicing fee, from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow. With the net offering proceeds and indebtedness, we acquired   $497.9 million   in real estate assets and incurred acquisition-related expenses of   $16.2 million  , including costs of   $12.5 million   in acquisition fees and expense reimbursements to CR V Advisors. As of   November 7, 2016  , we have sold approximately   12.1 million   Class A Shares and   191,000   Class T Shares in the Offering for total gross offering proceeds of   $306.5 million  .

The Board has adopted a share redemption program that permits our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described in the Registration Statement. We may waive the one-year holding period upon request in the event of death, bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances as determined by our advisor. In addition, the Board may choose to amend the terms of, suspend or terminate our share redemption program at any time upon 30 days  notice. Under our share redemption program, we will not redeem in excess of 5.0% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12 months prior to the end of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid. Funding for the redemption of shares will be limited to the cumulative net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares under the DRIP, net of shares redeemed to date. In addition, we will generally limit quarterly redemptions to approximately 1.25% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the trailing 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the redemptions are being paid, and to the net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares in the respective quarter under the DRIP. 
  In general, we redeem shares on a quarterly basis. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed shares, including those redeemable due to death, as follows:
