   (Unaudited)   

Note 1. Nature of Operations    
     
  BAB, Inc. ( the Company ) has three wholly owned subsidiaries: BAB Systems, Inc. ( Systems ), BAB Operations, Inc. ( Operations ) and BAB Investments, Inc ( Investments ). Systems was incorporated on December 2, 1992, and was primarily established to franchise Big Apple Bagels  ( BAB ) specialty bagel retail stores. My Favorite Muffin ( MFM ), was acquired in 1997 and is included as a part of Systems. Brewster s  Coffee ( Brewster s ) was established in 1996 and the coffee is sold in BAB and MFM locations as well as through license agreements. SweetDuet  ( SD ) frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Operations was formed on August 30, 1995, primarily to operate Company-owned stores of which there are currently none. The assets of Jacobs Bros. Bagels  ( Jacobs Bros. ) were acquired on February 1, 1999, and any branded wholesale business uses this trademark. Investments was incorporated September 9, 2009 to be used for the purpose of acquisitions. To date, there have been no acquisitions.   
     
  The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 12, 2000.  The Company currently franchises and licenses bagel and muffin retail units under the BAB and MFM and SD trade names. At August 31, 2016, the Company had 86 franchise units and 3 licensed units in operation in 23 states and one international location. The Company additionally derives income from the sale of its trademark bagels, muffins and coffee through nontraditional channels of distribution including under licensing agreements with Kohr Bros. Frozen Custard and Green Beans Coffee. Also, included in licensing fees and other income is Operations Sign Shop results. For franchise consistency and convenience, the Sign Shop provides the majority of signage to franchisees, including but not limited to, menu panels, build charts, interior and exterior signage and point of purchase materials.  
     
  The BAB franchised brand consists of units operating as  Big Apple Bagels ,  featuring daily baked bagels, flavored cream cheeses, premium coffees, gourmet bagel sandwiches and other related products. Licensed BAB units serve the Company's frozen bagel and related products baked daily.  BAB units are primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Western United States. The MFM brand consists of units operating as "My Favorite Muffin ," featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins, coffees and related products, and units operating as "My Favorite Muffin and Bagel Cafe ," featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products.  The SweetDuet Frozen Yogurt   Gourmet Muffins  brand is a fusion concept, pairing self-serve frozen yogurt with MFM s exclusive line of My Favorite Muffin gourmet muffins. SD frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Although the Company doesn't actively market Brewster's stand-alone franchises, Brewster's coffee products are sold in most franchised units.      
     
  The Company is leveraging on the natural synergy of distributing muffin products in existing BAB units and, alternatively, bagel products and Brewster's Coffee in existing MFM units. The Company expects to continue to realize efficiencies in servicing the combined base of BAB and MFM franchisees.  
     
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations; nevertheless, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These financial statements and the notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2015 which was filed February 24, 2016.  In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the unaudited interim period presented include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the results of such interim period and the financial position as of the end of said period. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.

3. Earnings     per Share    
     
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:     

The Company excluded 175,000 potential shares attributable to outstanding stock options from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2015, the Company excluded 237,500 potential shares attributable to outstanding stock options from the calculation.  

4.  Long-Term Debt   
     
  On September 6, 2002, the Company signed a note payable requiring annual installments of $35,000, including interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum, for a term of 15 years, in the original amount of $386,000. The Company purchased and retired 1,380,040 shares of BAB, Inc. common stock from a former stockholder. The balance of the note payable as of August 31, 2016, $33,413, is all current debt. The final payment is due October 1, 2016.

5.  Stock Options    
     
  In May 2001, the Company approved a Long-Term Incentive and Stock Option Plan ( Plan ). The Plan reserved and has issued 1,400,000 shares of common stock for grant. As of August 31, 2016, there were 1,225,000 stock options exercised or forfeited under the Plan.    

To value option grants and other awards for stock-based compensation, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model. When the measurement date is certain, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant and is based on the assumptions used for the expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates and future dividend payments.   
     
  The Company s stock option terms expire in ten years and vary in vesting from immediate to a vesting period of five years.  
     
  The following table summarizes the stock options outstanding and exercisable at August 31, 2016:  

There is no computation for the aggregate intrinsic value in the table above because the outstanding options weighted average exercise price was greater than the Company s closing stock price of $0.72 as of the last business day of the period ended August 31, 2016. There were 62,500 unexercised options that expired and no options exercised during the nine month period ended August 31, 2016.  

6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
     
  Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 350  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  requires that assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but instead be subject to annual impairment tests. The Company follows this guidance.  
     
  The Company tests goodwill and trademarks that are not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. Goodwill and trademarks were tested at the end of the first quarter, February 29, 2016 and it was found that the carrying value of the intangible assets were not impaired.   
     
  With respect to goodwill and trademarks, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value. If, based on that assessment, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, a two-step impairment test is performed. Based on the computation it was determined that no impairment has occurred. There were no factors noted at August 31, 2016 that would require additional testing.

7. Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2014-09 establishes a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for virtually all industries in U.S. GAAP, including those that previously followed industry-specific guidance such as the real estate, construction and software industries. The revenue standard s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. The standard requires five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Entities will generally be required to make more estimates and use more judgment than under current guidance, which will be highlighted for users through increased disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for the Company, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2019 and the Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance might have on the Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.   
     
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a leasing standard for both lessees and lessors. Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. GAAP. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2020 and the Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance might have on the Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows and results and operations.   
     
  Management does not believe that there are any other recently issued and effective or not yet effective pronouncements as of August 31, 2016 that would have or are expected to have any significant effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.   

8. Stockholder s Equity   
       
  On September 6, 2016 the Board of Directors declared a $0.01 cash dividend/distribution to shareholders of record as of September 23, 2016, payable October 12, 2016.  
       
  On June 6, 2016 the Board of Directors declared a $0.01 cash dividend/distribution to shareholders of record as of June 24, 2016, paid July 11, 2016.  
     
  On March 3, 2016 the Board of Directors declared a $0.01 cash distribution/dividend to shareholders of record as of March 23, 2016, paid on April 13, 2016.  
     
  The Board of Directors declared a cash distribution/dividend on December 3, 2015 of $0.03 which consisted of a $0.01 quarterly and a $0.02 special cash distribution/dividend per share paid on January 6, 2016.   

9. Contingencies   and Settlements   
       
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such proceedings or claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any of such proceedings or claims will have a material effect on our financial position. Except as stated below, we know of no pending or threatened proceeding or claim to which we are or will be a party.   
     
  The Company had previously reported that on July 8, 2013, a judgment was entered in the Circuit Court of Cook County against BAB Operations, Inc. ( Operations ), a wholly owned subsidiary of BAB, Inc., and in favor of a former landlord of Operations, Alecta Real Estate USA, LLC.  In September 2013 the Company filed an appeal. On March 23, 2015 the Appellate Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and against Operations, affirming the trial court s judgment. The legal settlement was accrued in the first quarter 2015 and payment was made in the second quarter 2015 and it included the judgment, attorney s fees and interest.

ITEM 2.     
 
   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      
     
  Certain statements contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including statements regarding the development of the Company's business, the markets for the Company's products, anticipated capital expenditures, and the effects of completed and proposed acquisitions, and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements as is within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as set forth in this report, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain risks and uncertainties are wholly or partially outside the control of the Company and its management, including its ability to attract new franchisees; the continued success of current franchisees; the effects of competition on franchisee s  and consumer acceptance of the Company's products in new and existing markets; fluctuation in development and operating costs; brand awareness; availability and terms of capital; adverse publicity; acceptance of new product offerings; availability of locations and terms of sites for store development; food, labor and employee benefit costs; changes in government regulation (including increases in the minimum wag e);  regional economic and weather conditions; the hiring, training, and retention of skilled corporate and restaurant management; and the integration and assimilation of acquired concepts. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.   
     
   General   
     
  There are 86 franchised and 3 licensed units at August 31, 2016 compared to 81 franchised and 5 licensed units at August 31, 2015.  System-wide revenues for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 were $26.4 million as compared to August 31, 2015 which were $26.0 million.   
     
  The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the ongoing royalties paid to the Company by its franchisees and receipt of initial franchise fees.  Additionally, the Company derives revenue from the sale of licensed products (My Favorite Muffin mix, Big Apple Bagels cream cheese, Big Apple Bagels frozen bagels and Brewster's coffee), and through nontraditional channels of distribution (Kohr Bros. and Green Beans Coffee). Also included in licensing fees and other income is Operation s Sign Shop revenue. The Sign Shop provides the majority of signage, which includes but is not limited to, posters, menu panels, outside window stickers and counter signs to franchisees to provide consistency and convenience.  
     
  Royalty fees represent a 5% fee on net retail and wholesale sales of franchised units. Royalty revenues are recognized on an accrual basis using actual franchise receipts. Generally, franchisees report and remit royalties on a weekly basis. The majority of month-end receipts are recorded on an accrual basis based on actual numbers from reports received from franchisees shortly after the month-end. Estimates are utilized in certain instances where actual numbers have not been received and such estimates are based on the average of the last 10 weeks  actual reported sales.   
     
  The Company recognizes franchise fee revenue upon the opening of a franchise store or upon the signing of a Master Franchise Agreement. Direct costs associated with the franchise sale are deferred until the franchise fee revenue is recognized.  These costs include site approval, construction approval, commissions, blueprints and training costs.  
     
  The Company earns licensing fees from the sale of BAB branded products, which includes coffee, cream cheese, muffin mix and frozen bagels from a third-party commercial bakery, to the franchised and licensed   units.  
     
  As of August 31, 2016, the Company employed 14 full-time employees at the Corporate office. The employees are responsible for corporate management and oversight, accounting, advertising and franchising.  None of the Company's employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements and management considers its relations with its employees to be good.

Results of Operations    
     
   Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 versus Three Months Ended August 31, 2015   
     
  For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported net income of $165,000 and $135,000, respectively. Total revenue of $616,000 increased $7,000, or 1.1%, for the three months ended August 31, 2016, as compared to total revenue of $609,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.   
     
  Royalty fee revenue of $442,000, for the quarter ended August 31, 2016, increased $1,000, or 0.2%, from the $441,000 for quarter ended August 31, 2015. There were more locations in 2016 versus same period in 2015.  
     
  Franchise fee revenues of $60,000, for the quarter ended August 31, 2016, increased $10,000, or 20.0% from the $50,000 for quarter ended August 31, 2015. The revenue consists of two new store openings and two transfers for the three months ending August 31, 2016 compared to two store openings and no transfers in the same period 2015.   
     
  Licensing fee and other income of $114,000, for the quarter ended August 31, 2016, decreased $4,000, or 3.4% from $118,000 for the quarter ended August 31, 2015. The decrease in licensing fees and other income was primarily due to a decrease in settlement income of $16,000 and a $1,000 decrease in Sign Shop revenue, offset by an increase of $13,000 in nontraditional revenue.   
     
  Total operating expenses of $451,000, for the quarter ended August 31, 2016 decreased $31,000, or 6.4% from $482,000 for the quarter ended August 31, 2015. The 2016 decrease was primarily due to decreases in payroll expense of $19,000, SEC and annual meeting expense of $6,000, advertising and promotion expense of $4,000, travel expenses of $3,000, Sign Shop cost of goods sold of $3,000, and a decrease in general expenses of $4,000, offset by an $8,000 increase in legal fees   
     
  Interest income for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was less than $1,000. Interest expense was less than $1,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $1,000 for the same period 2015.  
     
  There was no tax expense or benefit for the three months ended August 31, 2016 versus a $9,000 tax benefit in the same period 2015.  
     
  Earnings per share, as reported for basic and diluted outstanding shares for the third quarter ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.02.  
     
   Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 versus Nine Months Ended August 31, 2015   
     
  For the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported net income of $386,000 and $9,000, respectively. Total revenue of $1,761,000 increased $92,000, or 5.5%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, as compared to total revenue of $1,669,000 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015.   
     
  Royalty fee revenue of $1,298,000, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, increased $20,000, or 1.6%, from the $1,278,000 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. Royalty revenues increased because of more locations in 2016 versus the same period in 2015.   
     
  Franchise fee revenues of $78,000, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, decreased $2,000, or 2.5% from the $80,000 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. The revenue consists of two new store openings and six transfers for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 compared to three store openings, which included one BAB Express store, and three stores transferred in 2015.   
     
  Licensing fee and other income of $385,000, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, increased $74,000, or 23.8%, from $311,000 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. The $74,000 increase in 2016 was primarily due to increases in nontraditional revenue of $61,000, Sign Shop revenue of $8,000 and an increase of $5,000 for settlement fees in nine months of 2016 compared to the same period 2015.

Total operating expenses of $1,375,000 decreased $293,000, or 17.6%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, from $1,668,000 for the same period 2015. The decrease in total operating expenses in 2016 as compared to same period 2015 was primarily due to a 2015 expense of $243,000 for a legal settlement where there was no such expense in 2016. In addition for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 payroll related expenses decreased $61,000, primarily due to fewer employees and no Christmas bonus in fiscal 2016 versus a Christmas bonuses of $24,000 in 2015. In addition in 2016 there was a decrease in advertising and promotion of $9,000 and a decrease in travel of $7,000, offset by an increase of $12,000 for Sign Shop cost of goods sold, an increase of $10,000 for general operation expenses, $2,000 for depreciation and amortization and $2,000 for employee benefit expense.   
     
  Interest income for both the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was under $1,000. Interest expense for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1,000 and $2,000, respectively.  
     
  There was no income tax expense or benefit recorded for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and a $9,000 income tax benefit for the same period 2015.  
     
  Earnings per share, as reported for basic and diluted outstanding shares for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $0.05 per share compared to $0.00 per share for the nine months ended August 31, 2015.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
  At August 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $561,000 and unrestricted cash of $818,000. At November 30, 2015 the Company had working capital of $527,000 and unrestricted cash of $837,000.  
         
  During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Company had net income of $386,000 and operating activities provided cash of $348,000. The principal adjustments to reconcile the net income to cash provided in operating activities for the nine months ending August 31, 2016 were depreciation and amortization of $15,000 less a provision for uncollectible accounts of $4,000. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash by $50,000. During August 31, 2015, the Company had a net income of $9,000 and operating activities provided cash of $279,000. The principal adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ending August 31, 2015 were depreciation and amortization of $13,000 less a provision for uncollectible accounts of $7,000. In addition changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash by $264,000.  
     
  The Company used $4,000 and $3,000 for investing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
     
  The Company used $363,000 and $291,000 for cash distribution/dividend payments during the nine month period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  On September 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $0.01 per share cash distribution/dividend to shareholders of record as of September 23, 2016, payable October 12, 2016. Although there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to pay cash distributions/dividends in the future, it is the Company s intent that future cash distributions/dividends will be considered based on profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. It is the Company s intent going forward to declare and pay cash distributions/dividends on a quarterly basis if warranted.   
     
  The Company believes execution of its cash distribution/dividend policy will not have any material adverse effects on its cash or its ability to fund current operations or future capital investments.  
     
  The Company has no financial covenants on its outstanding debt.

Cash Distribution and Dividend Policy   
     
  It is the Company s intent that future cash distributions/dividends will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Due to the general economic downturn and its impact on the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient earnings to pay out cash distributions/dividends. The Company will continue to analyze its ability to pay cash distributions/dividends on a quarterly basis.  
     
  The Company believes that for tax purposes the cash distributions declared in 2016 may be treated as a return of capital to stockholders depending on each stockholder s basis or it may be treated as a dividend or a combination of the two. Determination of whether it is a cash distribution, cash dividend or combination of the two will not be made until after December 31, 2016, as the classification or combination is dependent upon the Company s earnings and profits for tax purposes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 2016.  
     
  The Company believes execution of this policy will not have any material adverse effect on its ability to fund current operations or future capital investments.   
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2014-09 establishes a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for virtually all industries in U.S. GAAP, including those that previously followed industry-specific guidance such as the real estate, construction and software industries. The revenue standard s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. The standard requires five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Entities will generally be required to make more estimates and use more judgment than under current guidance, which will be highlighted for users through increased disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for the Company, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2019 and the Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance might have on the Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.   
     
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a leasing standard for both lessees and lessors. Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. GAAP. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2020 and the Company is evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance might have on the Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows and results and operations.   
     
  Management does not believe that there are any other recently issued and effective or not yet effective pronouncements as of August 31, 2016 that would have or are expected to have any significant effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.   

Critical Accounting Policies    
     
  The Company has identified significant accounting policies that, as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions.  The Company's most critical accounting policies are related to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance.  Details regarding the Company's use of these policies and the related estimates are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2016.  There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting policies that impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the three or nine months ended August 31, 2016.
