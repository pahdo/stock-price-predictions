CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Alpha Network
Alliance Ventures Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), contains  forward-looking statements, 
as defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by terminology such as  may ,  will ,  should ,  could ,  expects ,
 plans ,  intends ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,
 potential  or  continue  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology.  These
forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected
activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources.  Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed
in these forward-looking statements.  The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual
results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other
things: the volatility of housing prices, the possibility that we will not receive sufficient customers to grow our business, the
Company s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, the exercise of the approximately 69.9% control the Company s
sole officer and director holds of the Company s voting securities, other factors over which we have little or no control;
and other factors discussed in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 

Our management has included projections and estimates
in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations,
discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise
publicly available.  We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date made.  We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  AUDITED  

September 30, 2016 

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  

The Company was originally organized in the State of
Delaware on March 24, 2011 as Daedalus Ventures, Inc. 

In December 2011 the Company completed a merger with
Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. Immediately upon the completion of the merger, the Company changed its name to Alpha Network
Alliance Ventures Inc. 

The Company is focused on building and operating a
social networking software application and other internet driven applications. The Company builds Social Network Marketing tools
that enable buyers, sellers, users to connect, share, discover and communicate with each other. The software application also allows
its users to post reviews and share shopping and fashion tips and opinions or to integrate their 3 rd  party websites
or shopping store sites. It also offers products that enable companies, advertisers and marketers to engage with its users using
a Social Network Marketing campaign and Social Medial Marketing campaign platform to boost the sales and membership for every affiliate
who wants to participate. 

The Company s market is mostly Overseas Contract
Workers (OCW) and majority is from the Philippines. The Company decided that it s appropriate to sell our KababayanKo.com Premium
Packages membership with products included to be more attractive and lucrative to every affiliate who buys and upgrades to Premium
Packages Membership, and as a result of the promotion they can also purchase the products inside Kababayanko.com Market Place
if they want it more. 

During 2014, The Company also moved its primary operations
to the Philippines.  The purpose of this move was to better centrally locate to its primary market.  Additionally, the
Company plans to recognize lower costs and better distribution. 

Recognizing the efficiency and cost effectivity of
its operations in the Philippines, the company appointed an independent distributor that will primarily handle the distribution
of its product in the Philippines. As a result of this, during 2015, the company has moved its primary operations back in the California,
United States. 

The Company s activities are subject to significant
risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company s market penetration
before another company develops a similar product. 

The Company is in the development stage as defined
under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 915-205  Development-Stage Entities. 
The Company has adopted the new provision of FASB ASC 915-275 and is not reporting inception to date activities as previously required. 

Basis of presentation  

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 

Use of estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

ALPHA NETWORK ALLIANCE VENTRUES, INC.  

   (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE ENTERPRISE)  

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  AUDITED  

September 30, 2016 

Cash and cash equivalents  

 The Company maintains a cash balance in a non-interest-bearing
account that currently does not exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Fair value of financial instruments and derivative
financial instruments  

 The Company s financial instruments include cash,
accounts payable, and notes payable. All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity
of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company did not engage
in any transaction involving derivative instruments. 

Inventory  

 Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market
and is computed on a first-in first-out basis. The inventory consists of weight loss products, energy and performance solutions
products and healthy aging solution products. 

Property and Equipment   

 Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major repairs
and betterments are capitalized and normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed
by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Office and general equipment are depreciated
over useful lives of 10 years and leasehold improvements are depreciated over a useful life of 20 years. Upon retirement or sale
of an asset, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. 

Federal income taxes  

 Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized
in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification 740.10.05
 Accounting for Income Taxes  as of its inception. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 740.10.05, the Company
is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. Potential benefits of net operating losses
have not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will
utilize the net operating losses carried forward to future years. 

Net income per share of common stock  

 Net loss per share is provided in accordance with FASB
ASC 260-10,  Earnings per Share . Basic net loss per common share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares
were issued, unless doing so is anti-dilutive. 

Common Stock Registration Expenses  

 The Company considers incremental costs and expenses
related to the registration of equity securities with the SEC, whether by contractual arrangement as of a certain date or by demand,
to be unrelated to original issuance transactions.  As such, subsequent registration costs and expenses are reflected
in the accompanying financial statements as general and administrative expenses, and are expensed as incurred. 

Research and Development  

 Costs for research and development, including predevelopment
efforts prior to establishing technological feasibility of software expected to be marketed, are expensed as incurred. Development
costs are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established and anticipated future revenues support the recoverability
of the capitalized amounts. Capitalization stops when the product is available for general release to customers. The Company has
not capitalized any software development, and has expensed these costs as incurred. These costs are included in research and development
expense.

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  AUDITED  

September 30, 2016 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
year ended December 31, 2015, the Company does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material
impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 

Note 2 - Uncertainty, going concern:   

The Company s financial statements are prepared
using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established
an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs to allow it to continue as a going concern. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 2,105,420. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain
adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company is contemplating conducting an offering of its debt or
equity securities to obtain additional operating capital. The Company is dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt,
to secure equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing
it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other
sources of financing and attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty. 

Note 3   Property and Equipment, net  

Property and equipment at year-end consisted of: 

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $4,719
and $4,044 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Note 4   Real Estate Held for Sale  

The Company owns real estate in the State of California.
This asset was purchased for daily operations. The Company has since moved its basic operations to the Philippines. In 2013, a
change in use on the building, improvements and the land was determined and these assets were converted to held for sale assets). 

On March 17, 2015, The Company transferred the property
and it accrued property taxes of $19,631 to its majority shareholder and reduced the shareholder related party note by $330,369.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

The following information should be read in conjunction
with (i) the consolidated financial statements of Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc., a Delaware corporation and development
stage company, and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information
and the December 31, 2015 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s most recent Annual Report
on Form 10-K (File No. 000-54126), as filed with the SEC on May 24, 2016.  Statements in this section and elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute  forward-looking  statements. 

OVERVIEW  

Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. is a development
stage company. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 12, 2010, and are engaged in the development
of a social networking website, www.kababayanko.com, for overseas workers from the Philippines and others who share or are interested
in their lifestyle. Our fiscal year end is December 31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our social networking website aims to provide
overseas workers from the Philippines with a platform to share their overseas working and living experiences, and interact with
a community of Filipino overseas workers from around the world. 

Our business offices are currently located at 11801
Pierce St., 2nd Floor, Riverside, California 92505. We have a website located at www.kababayanko.com; however, the information
contained on our website does not form a part of this Form 10-Q. 

Going Concern  

To date the Company has had little operations and little
revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations.  No material revenues are anticipated until
we obtain sufficient funds to implement our initial business plan.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. There are no
assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations.  Accordingly, these factors
raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our activities have been financed primarily from cash
loans from our sole director and officer. Due to related parties included in the balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were loans from the Company s director and Chief Executive Officer, Eleazar Rivera. He has lent the Company noninterest
bearing amounts of $718,996 as of September 30, 2016 and $647,240 as of December 31, 2015. Of this amount,
$418,996 is designated as advances from stockholders, while $300,000 is designated as deposit for future
share subscriptions. No subscribed shares are outstanding that cannot be legally issued until paid for. These advances are unsecured
and there are no terms for repayment. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ).  The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We
have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results: 

8  

Development Stage Company  

The Company is considered to be in the development
stage as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 7,  Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage
Enterprises . The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, and development. Additionally,
the Company has allocated a substantial portion of their time and investment in bringing their product to the market, and the raising
of capital. 

Use of Estimates  

The Company prepares financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles that require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge
of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
purchased with maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major repairs
and betterments are capitalized and normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed
by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, the cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximates their carrying amount.

PLAN OF OPERATION  

Our plan of operation for the following 12 months is
as follows, provided that we raise sufficient funds to commence such plan: 

We currently do not have any arrangements for further
financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further
financing, the successful development of our planned business consulting services, a successful marketing and promotion program,
and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant
dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available,
will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds
required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable.
At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing
will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.

Results of Operations   

Three- and Nine-Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

We recorded revenues of $3,524 for the six months ending
September 30, 2016, and $9,726 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We recorded revenues of $57,662 for the nine months
ending September 30, 2016, and $52,666 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred
total operating expenses of $79,475 consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses. Such general and administrative
expenses were comprised of wages of 75,000, rent of $99, travel expenses of $90, professional fees of $334, computer and Internet
expenses of $215 and other general and administrative expenses of $3,737. 

By contrast, for the three months ended September 30,
2015, we incurred total operating expenses of $97,012 consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses. Such general
and administrative expenses were comprised of wages of 82,278, rent of $129, travel expenses of $462, professional fees of $5,420,
office supplies of $166, computer and Internet expenses of $112 and other general and administrative expenses of $10,048. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred
total operating expenses of $305,104 consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses. Such general and administrative
expenses were comprised of marketing expenses of $244, wages of $226,500, rent of $1,365, travel expenses of $8,508, professional
fees of $9,107, office supplies of $302, computer and Internet expenses of $5,399 and other general and administrative expenses
of $53,679. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred
total operating expenses of $397,666, consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses. Such general and administrative
expenses were comprised of marketing expenses of $101,987, wages of $237,993, rent of $155, travel expenses of $4,780, professional
fees of $14,277, office supplies of $532, computer and Internet expenses of $202 and other general and administrative expenses
of $37,740. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred
a net loss from operations of $76,857, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss from operations
of $97,012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss from operations of $284,035, and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss from operations of $393,171. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $594,
and our total liabilities were $1,268,996.   We do not have sufficient cash on hand to commence our 12-month plan of
operation or to fund our ongoing operational expenses. We will need to raise funds to commence our 12-month plan of operation and
fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock.
If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our
Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise
sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our 12-month plan of operation and ongoing operational expenses. In
the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales
of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue
our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our 12-month plan of operation and our business will fail.
