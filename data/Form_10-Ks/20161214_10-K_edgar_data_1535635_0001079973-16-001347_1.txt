PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS   OVERVIEW OF OUR COMPANY

Service Team Inc.  (the "Company") was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2011.  The Company was organized to comply with the warranty obligations of electronic devices manufactured by companies outside of the United States.  The business proved to be unprofitable and the Company discontinued its warranty and repair operations.  On June 5, 2013, Service Team Inc. acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Trade Leasing, Inc. for 4,000,000 shares of its common stock.   

Trade Leasing, Inc., a California corporation, was incorporated on November 1, 2011, and commenced business January 1, 2013.  Trade Leasing, Inc. is principally involved in the manufacturing, maintenance and repair of truck bodies.  Service Team Inc. and Trade Leasing Inc. have not been involved in a bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding. The acquisition of Trade Leasing Inc. is a major change in the operations of Service Team Inc. Trade Leasing is operated as a separate division of Service Team Inc.

Trade Leasing Division.   This division is involved in the manufacture and repair of truck bodies.  The company manufactures truck bodies that are attached to a truck chassis which consists of an engine, drive train, a frame with wheels, and in some cases, a cab.  The truck chassis is manufactured by third parties that are major automotive or truck companies.  These companies do not typically build specialized truck bodies.  The company is also involved in other products used by the trucking industry.     The company operates a complete manufacturing and repair facility in South Gate, California.  The facility manufactures both custom and standard production truck bodies in approximately 70 different models designed to fill the specialized demands of the user.   The vans are available for hauling dry freight or refrigerated freight.  The refrigerated vans are built with two to four inches of foam insulating that is sprayed in place for hauling refrigerated products such as meats, vegetables, flowers and similar products.  The Company installs different types of cooling systems in the trucks.  This varies from motor driven units installed outside the van body or refrigeration units driven off the engine of the truck.  Some refrigerated trucks use a system called "cold plate" where a large metal plate is cooled by power while the truck is parked.  The power is then unplugged and the truck will stay cool for many hours.  The Company's customers are auto dealers and users of trucks; such as dairies, food distributors and local delivery. The company has approximately 400 customers. One customer, South Bay Ford, represented more than 10% of sales in the last 12 months. The company is not dependent on a few major customers. Trade Leasing purchases raw materials from approximately 25 suppliers.  There are several hundred similar suppliers of comparable materials in the local area. Trade Leasing Inc. purchases refrigeration units from Thermoking Corporation, a division of United Technologies and Carrier Corporation, a division of Ingersol Rand Corporation. The two companies represent more than 80% of the refrigeration unit market. There are several other manufactures of refrigeration units that represent a small part of the market. Trade Leasing Inc. employs 47 factory workers and five management personnel.  The management personnel make all of the sales and manage the factory. The company has all of the government licenses necessary to conduct its business. These include nine different city, county and state licenses covering vehicle transportation, air quality, hazard waste (Paint), land or building use, and sales tax.

Acquisition of Trade Leasing, Inc.

On June 5, 2013, Service Team Inc. completed a Stock Exchange Agreement with Hallmark Holdings Inc. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, Service Team Inc. acquired 100 percent of the shares of Trade Leasing, Inc., a California corporation.  This transaction gave Service Team Inc. ownership of the business operations which included furniture, manufacturing equipment, vehicles and other assets in exchange for 4,000,000 common shares of Service Team Inc.

4 

This acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition by entities under common control due to the fact that both Service Team Inc. and Trade Leasing, Inc. were and continue to be commonly held by Hallmark Holdings and its affiliates. The ownership structure of the Company did not change as a result nor did any of its officers change positions.  As the assets acquired were from an entity under common control, the assets from Trade Leasing, Inc. have been combined at historical cost for all periods presented, with no step-up in basis.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Our common stock was approved for listing on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol SVTE on October 9, 2012.   As of August 31, 2016, there were 117 active shareholders and the total shares outstanding of 168,671,089.   The transfer agent for our common stock is  Pacific Stock Transfer 4045 South Spencer Street, Suite 403, Las Vegas, Nevada 98119.

The following table shows the reported high and low closing bid quotations per share for our common stock based on information provided by the OTC Bulletin Board for the periods indicated. Quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without markup, markdown or commissions and may not represent actual transactions.  

Trades in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.  For transactions covered by the rule, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchaser's written  agreement to the transaction before the sale. 

Our shares are subject to rules applicable to "penny stock" which pertain to any equity security with a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share.  Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market. A broker-dealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer, and sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in our shares.

Dividend Policy

We have not paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not foresee doing so in the foreseeable future.  We intend to retain any future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business.  Any decision as to future payment of dividends will depend on the available earnings, the capital requirements of our Company, our general financial condition and other factors deemed pertinent by our Board of Directors.

Overview

Service Team Inc.  (the "Company") was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2011.  The Company was organized to comply with the warranty obligations of electronic devices manufactured by companies outside of the United States.  The business proved to be unprofitable and the Company discontinued its warranty and repair operations.  On June 5, 2013, Service Team Inc. acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Trade Leasing, Inc. for 4,000,000 shares of its common stock.   

Trade Leasing, Inc., a California corporation, was incorporated on November 1, 2011, and commenced business January 1, 2013.  Trade Leasing, Inc. is principally involved in the manufacturing, maintenance and repair of truck bodies.  Service Team Inc. and Trade Leasing Inc. have not been involved in a bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding. The acquisition of Trade Leasing Inc. is a major change in the operations of Service Team Inc.

7 

Service Team, Inc. has paid $40,000 in cash as of August 31, 2016 towards the acquisition of MCV Companies, Inc., which has not yet been completed.  Therefore, as of August 31, 2016, the amount is included within other currents assets as the Company expects that the closing will occur within six months. 

Results of Operations

The Company had sales of $3,030,734 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, compared to $2,611,766 during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $418,968 or 16%.   All of the sales are generated by Trade Leasing, Inc. The Service Products Division had no sales.   Cost of sales increased $191,043 from $2,334,822 to $2,525,865 from 2015 to 2016 which was due to increase in volume of production in the year 2016.   Gross margin increased by $227,925 from $276,944 to $504,869 from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the increase in sales during 2016.   Operating and other expenses decreased by $446,417 from $838,318 to $391,901 from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to stock based compensation expense resulting from the issuance of the preferred stock.   The above changes resulted in net loss of $211,088 during the 2016 fiscal year compared to a net loss of $637,564 during the 2015 fiscal year, primarily driven by increased stock based compensation due to the issuance of preferred stock during the 2015 fiscal year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of August 31, 2016, we had total assets of $651,932 including current assets of $584,151.   We also have current and total liabilities of $301,716 which consist of related party convertible notes of $6,768, third party convertible notes of $34,040, accrued interest of $18,261, other accrued expenses of $104,649, and accounts payable of $137,998.  There is no firm date which these are to be paid. It is to be repaid when we have  funds available.   We believe our ability to achieve commercial success and continued growth will be dependent upon our continued access to capital either through additional sale of our equity or cash generated from operations. We will seek to obtain additional working capital through the sale of our securities. We will attempt to obtain additional capital through bank lines of credit; however, we have no agreements or understandings with third parties at this time.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors

Service Team Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Service Team Inc. as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Service Team Inc. as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations, changes in shareholders' deficit and cash flows for the period described above in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION 

Organization 

Service Team Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2011.  The Company was organized to comply with the warranty obligations of electronic devices manufactured by companies outside of the United States.  The business proved to be unprofitable and the Company discontinued its warranty and repair operations.  On June 5, 2013, Service Team Inc. acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Trade Leasing, Inc. for 4,000,000 shares of its common stock.

Trade Leasing, Inc., a California corporation, was incorporated on November 1, 2011, and commenced business January 1, 2013.  Trade Leasing, Inc. is principally involved in the manufacturing, maintenance and repair of truck bodies.  Service Team Inc. and Trade Leasing Inc. have not been involved in a bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding.

The Company has established a fiscal year end of August 31.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements presented in this report are the combined financial reports of Trade Leasing, Inc. and Service Team Inc. 

The Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").

The consolidated financial statements present the Balance Sheet, Statements of Operations, Shareholders' Deficit and Cash Flows of the Company. These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The accompanying audited, consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K.  All adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods have been made and are of a recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed herein.

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Service Team Inc. and Trade Leasing, Inc. both of which are under common control and ownership. The consolidated financial statements herein contain the operations of the wholly-owned subsidiaries listed above. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of these financial statements. 

F-7 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Going Concern 

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its initial operations by issuing common shares and debt.  We cannot be certain that capital will be provided when it is required.

Cash and Equivalents 

Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000. There were no cash equivalents at August 31, 2016 or August 31, 2015.

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with credit quality institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of FDIC insurance limits.

Accounts Receivable 

All accounts receivable are due thirty (30) days from the date billed. If the funds are not received within thirty (30) days the customer is contacted to arrange payment. The Company uses the allowance method to account for uncollectable accounts receivable.

The new facility is a 25,000 square foot concrete industrial building located on approximately two acres of land.  This new facility is approximately double the size of the prior facility.  Rent for the new facility is $10,000 per month for the first six months; and then $14,000 per month thereafter.  The Company is responsible for the property taxes and insurance on the building.  As of August 31, 2016, the deferred rent related to this lease was $20,333.

Our principal executive offices are located in 600 square feet in a building at 18482 Park Villa Place, Villa Park, California 92861. The space is furnished by Robert L. Cashman, a related party, at no charge.  

Beneficial Conversion Features 

From time to time, the Company may issue convertible notes that may contain an imbedded beneficial conversion feature. A beneficial conversion feature exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of warrants, if related warrants have been granted. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is recorded as a debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820 on June 6, 2011. Under this FASB, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.

F-9 

The Company has various financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard including: cash, convertible notes payable, accrued expenses, promissory notes payable, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:

Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. The fair value of the Company's cash is based on quoted prices and therefore classified as Level 1.

Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, promissory notes and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheet are estimated by management to approximate fair market value due to their short term nature.

The following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured and recognized at fair value as of August 31, 2016 on a recurring basis:

The following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured and recognized at fair value as of August 31, 2015 on a recurring basis:

Income Taxes 

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical operating results and the uncertainty of the economic conditions, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at August 31, 2016 and 2015 where it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized.

Revenue Recognition 

The Trade Leasing Division receives orders from customers to build or repair truck bodies. The company builds the requested product. At the completion of the product the truck is delivered to the customer.  If the customer accepts the product Trade Leasing Inc. issues an invoice to the customer for the job. The invoice is entered into our accounting system and is recognized as revenue at that time.

In the Trade Leasing Division we use the completed contract method for truck bodies built, which typically have construction periods of 15 days or less. Contracts are considered complete when title has passed, the customer has accepted the product and we do not retain risks or rewards of ownership of the truck bodies. Losses are accrued if manufacturing costs are expected to exceed manufacturing contract revenue.  Manufacturing expenses are primarily composed of aluminum cost, which is the largest component of our raw materials cost and the cost of labor. 

As described above, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 605-10-599, the Company recognizes revenue when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (contracts); (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the seller's price is fixed or determinable (per the customer's contract); and (4) collectability is reasonably assured (based upon our credit policy).

Share Based Expenses 

The Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB .  The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.

Stock Based Compensation 

In December of 2004, the FASB issued a standard which applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. For any unvested portion of previously issued and outstanding awards, compensation expense is required to be recorded based on the previously disclosed methodology and amounts. Prior periods presented are not required to be restated. We adopted the standard as of inception.  The Company has not issued any stock options to its Board of Directors and officers as compensation for their services.  If options are granted, they will be accounted for at a fair value as required by the FASB ASC 718.

Net Loss Per Share 

The Company adopted the standard issued by the FASB, which requires presentation of basic earnings or loss per share and diluted earnings or loss per share. Basic income (loss) per share ("Basic EPS") is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") are similarly calculated using the treasury stock method except that the denominator is increased to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive securities at the end of the applicable period were exercised. During the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported a net loss from operations.  The diluted shares outstanding excludes the effect of diluted securities due to the anti-dilutive effect.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board "FASB" issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. The adoption of Accounting Standards Update "ASU" 2014-16 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply push down accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ("ASU 2015-03"), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.

In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ("ASU 2015-14"). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. 

In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) ("ASU 2015-16"). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 6   CONVERTIBLE NOTES RECEIVABLE 

During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, the Company advanced cash of $42,500 in the form of notes receiveable to Hallmark Venture Group, Inc., which is a Company formerly controlled by the CEO and President of Service Team, Inc.  Amounts  were advanced as follows: $7,500 on April 7, 2016, $5,000 on April 12, 2016, $25,000 on May 12, 2016, and $5,000 on August 22, 2016.  Each loan amount is due to be paid back after the maturity date of 1 year has passed.   The amounts loaned are convertible into shares of Hallmark Venture Group at the rate of 45% times the market price which is defined as the lowest three closing bids for the common stock during the three trading day period ending one trading day prior to the date of the conversion notice. As Hallmark Venture Group did not have the funds to repay the amounts nor the credit worthiness to ensure repayment in accordance with the terms of the notes receivable, the Company fully reserved the note receivable with a $42,500 charge to the allowance for doubtful acounts resulting in a net zero balance for the convertible note receivable as of August 31, 2016. 

NOTE 7   INCOME TAXES 

The Company accounts for income taxes under standards issued by the FASB. Under those standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax benefits or consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized through future operations.

F-24 

No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded due to the available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $491,107 will expire in various years through 2032. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the future tax loss carry forwards.

The actual income tax provisions differ from the expected amounts calculated by applying the statutory income tax rate to the Company's loss before income taxes.  The components of these differences are as follows at August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015:

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being August 31, 2016.

Based on this evaluation, these officers concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission.  The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as identified below under the heading "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting." Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated.

Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.    

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The term "internal control over financial reporting" is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, an issuer's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

(1)

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; and

(2)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer.

9 

Under the supervision of our president, being our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, being our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 using the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as at August 31, 2016.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, we determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses which are indicative of many small companies with small staff, such as: 

(1)

inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and

(2)

insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(3)

inadequate closing process to ensure all material misstatements are corrected in the financial statements.  This was evidenced by the fact that there were audit adjustments and restatements of the financial statements.

These control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements could not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis.  As a result of the material weaknesses described above, we concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by COSO. Our management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above deficiencies.   During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the weaknesses described above.   However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Director Independence

At the present time, we have one director who is an "insider."  Director,  Robert L. Cashman, also serves as President, Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer.  We are currently recruiting outside directors who have some knowledge of our business.  New directors are nominated by either of the present directors and voted on by the Board of Directors.  Each director is elected to hold office for a one year period or until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until his/her successor has been qualified and elected following the one year of service.  We have not adopted a formal code of ethics as we only have two officers and directors and will adopt a code of ethics when we have appointed independent directors.  The Officers serve at the discretion of the Company's directors.  There are no understandings between any of the directors or officers of the Company or any other person pursuant to which any officer or director was or is to be selected as an officer or director.  Robert L. Cashman serves as Chairman and Secretary of the Board.

The Board of Directors has held five Special Directors' Meetings since the inception of the Company.  All the directors attended all of the meetings.  It is a policy of the Company that all Board Members attend all Board Meetings and the Annual Meeting.

Committees 

At the present time, the Board of Directors serves as an Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Compensation Committee.  None of these committees have had any meetings since the inception of the Company.  It is planned that as we add independent Board Members we will activate these committees.

NOMINATING COMMITTEE:   Director Robert L. Cashman participates in consideration of director nominees.  At the present time Service Team is too small to warrant a Nominating Committee.

AUDIT COMMITTEE:  We do not have a separate Audit Committee or a Financial Expert as defined in Rule S-K, Rule 407.  The Board of Directors serves as the Audit Committee.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE:   The Board of Directors acts as the Compensation Committee. The directors feel Service Team is too small to have a Compensation Committee at this time.  As additional directors are appointed, a formal Compensation Committee will be established.
