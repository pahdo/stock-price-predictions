and for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is unaudited but includes all adjustments, which, in the opinion
of management are necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading at such dates and for those periods. These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
for interim financial information and ,therefore, do not include all information and notes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating results for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. 

Note 2 - Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

MANASOTA GROUP, Inc. f/k/a
HORIZON BANCORPORATION, Inc, Bradenton, Florida (the  Company  or  we ) was a one-bank holding company with
respect to Horizon Bank, Bradenton, Florida (the  Bank ).  The Company commenced banking operations on October
25, 1999 when the Bank opened for business.  On September 10, 2010, the Company ceased to be a bank holding company when
the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (the  OFR ) closed the Bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the  FDIC ) was appointed as receiver. The FDIC sold the Bank to the Bank of the Ozarks. The Bank was primarily engaged
in the business of obtaining deposits and providing commercial, consumer, and real estate loans to the general public.  Bank
deposits were each insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC subject to certain limitations. After September 10, 2010, the Company s
business consisted of owning, maintaining and holding for lease its sole asset, an approximately 7,000 square foot office building
located at 900 53 rd  Ave E, Bradenton, FL (the  Building ). The Building was leased to Bank of the Ozarks
under a 3-year lease which expired on September 10, 2013. Subsequently the Building was leased to 1 st  Manatee Bank in
December of 2013 under a three year lease with an option to purchase. The Building was sold to 1 st  Manatee Bank during
the period covered by this Report. 

The Company is authorized
to issue up to 25.0 million shares of its $.01 par value per share common stock.  Each share is entitled to one vote
and shareholders have no preemptive or conversion rights.  As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were
1,809,912 shares Company s common stock issued outstanding, 39,773 shares of which were held as treasury stock.  Additionally,
the Company is authorized to issue up to 1.0 million shares of its $.01 par value per share preferred stock, which may be designated
by the Company s Board, without further action by the shareholders, for any proper corporate purpose with preferences, voting powers,
conversion rights, qualifications, special or relative rights and privileges which could adversely affect the voting power or other
rights of shareholders of common stock.   As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there was no designated preferred
stock and no shares issued or outstanding. 

Use of Estimates.   The accounting
and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Concentration of Credit Risk.  Cash is
maintained at a major financial institution and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has never
experienced any losses related to these balances. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that
it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on the accounts. As of September 30, 2015, all non-interest bearing checking accounts
were FDIC insured to a limit of $250,000. The Company did not have any interest-bearing accounts at September 30, 2015 or December
31, 2014, respectively. 

Property .   The Company s
property consists of land, the Building and building improvements, and is stated at cost. The straight-line method is used in computing
depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the building and improvements of 10 to 40 years. Expenditures which significantly
increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from
the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the current earnings. 

6   

The Company follows the
provisions of FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, which establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets such as property and equipment. The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held-and-used for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted
expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a long-lived asset group is less than its carrying amount, the asset
is considered to be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when management s estimate of fair value, through outside
consultation or internal assessment of value is less than its carrying amount. There were no impairment charges for the periods
ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 related to these long-lived assets. 

Income Taxes.  Income taxes are accounted
for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire
deferred tax asset will not be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is  more likely than not 
that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized
is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting
the  more likely than not  test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company is no longer subject to examination by U.S.
taxing authorities for years prior to 2010. 

Sales Taxes.  Amounts collected on behalf
of governmental authorities for sales taxes and other similar taxes are reported on a net basis. 

Revenue Recognition.  The Company recognizes
its rental revenues based on the terms on its signed lease with tenant on a straight-line basis. 

Earnings Per Share.   Basic
earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted
income per share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased by
the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise of stock options.  This also assumes that only options
with an exercise price below the existing market price will be exercised.  In computing net income per share, the Company
uses the treasury stock method. 

Reclassification . Certain reclassifications
have been made to the prior period s financial statements to conform to the current period s presentation. 

Subsequent Events . Management has evaluated
subsequent events through October 7, 2016, the date the financial statements were issued. 

Note 3   Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements  

The Company s management
does not believe that any recent codified pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) will
have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

Note 4   Going Concern  

The accompanying financial
statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

The Company sold its significant
operating asset and has had no operating activity subsequent to September 29, 2015. There are no assurances that the Company will
be able. in the next twelve months, to either (1) consummate a business combination transaction with a privately-owned business
seeking to become a public company and, if successful in such consummation, achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient
cash flow from operations; or (2) otherwise obtain additional financing through either private placements, public offerings and/or
bank financing necessary to support the Company s current working capital requirements and to retire existing liabilities and obligations,
if any, on a timely basis.  To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings and/or bank
financing are insufficient to support the Company, the Company will have to raise additional working capital.  No assurance
can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. 

7   

If, during the next twelve
months, a business combination is not consummated and no additional operating capital is received, the Company will be forced to
rely on existing cash on hand and upon additional funds loaned by management and/or significant stockholders to preserve the integrity
of the corporate entity.  In the event, the Company is unable to acquire advances from management and/or significant
stockholders, who have no legal obligation to provide any further funding, the Company may not continue its operations. 

Note 5   Discontinued Operations and Gain on Sale of Property  

On September 29, 2015,
the Company completed the sale of a building and land to the lessee for a total sale price of $2,100,000. The Company recognized
a gain on the sale of approximately $1.0 million. At the time of the sale, the Company paid off the principal balance of the mortgage
note secured by the property and accrued interest totaling approximately $1,432,000. 

Discontinued operations - assets consisted of the following: 

The building served as collateral on the note
disclosed in note 4. 

Depreciation expense for each of the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 amounted to $20,917 and $27,889, respectively. 

The pre-tax gain on sale of property was calculated
as follows: 

Costs associated with the sale were approximately
$97,000. 

8   

The components of the income from discontinued operations consisted
of the following for the years ended December 31: 

Note 6   Payoff of Note  

On September 29, 2015,
the Company completed the sale of the Building and land to the lessee for a total sale price of $2,100,000. At the time of the
sale, the Company paid off the principal balance of the mortgage note secured by the property and accrued interest totaling approximately
$1,432,000. 

Note 7   Provision for Federal  
State Income Taxes  

The sale of the land and
building business resulted in the recognition of a taxable gain of approximately $1.0 million. As of September 30,
2015, the Company the gain was offset by prior year NOL s. The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact
of any additional losses that may occur during the remainder of its year ending June 30, 2015. As of September 30,
2015, the net federal and state tax impact of the gain (net of the losses incurred during the nine months ended September
30, 2015,and NOL carryovers from prior years) is approximately $62,000, which is related to the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT )
incurred in the amount of $11,000 and current state tax expense of $51,000. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company s effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35%,
primarily due to state taxes and AMT . 

In assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  As of
September 30, 2015, based upon the levels of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will not be able to realize the
benefits of these deductible differences.  Accordingly, a valuation allowance of approximately $4,145,000 has been provided
in the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2015. 

Note 8   Subsequent Events  

In October 2015, the Board
of Directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share totaling approximately $490,000. The dividend was paid in November 2015. 

Effective March 21, 2016,
we issued 2,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, $.01 par value, to each of four existing shareholders for the purchase
price of $.01 per share. The total consideration received by the Company was $20,000 in cash.

Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Operations.  

The following discussion
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes
included in this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result
of many factors, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  

Overview.  

The Registrant was incorporated
in the State of Florida on May 27, 1998, for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company owning all of the outstanding capital
stock of Horizon Bank, a commercial bank chartered under the laws of Florida and a member of the Federal Reserve System (the  Bank ).
The Bank opened for business on October 25, 1999. 

As previously reported,
during October 25, 1999 through September 10, 2010, the Company acted as a one-bank holding company with respect to the Bank. On
September 10, 2010, due to significant losses incurred by the Bank during 2008-2010, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation
(the  OFR ) declared the Bank to be  imminently insolvent.  The Bank was closed, with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ) being appointed as receiver therefor, and sold to Bank of the Ozarks. 

Pursuant to a settlement agreement with the FDIC and a three-year lease (the  Initial
Building Lease ), both entered into July 11, 2011, but effective September 11, 2010, we have owned, maintained and held for
rent the Building under a lease to Bank of the Ozarks for the last two years. On September 6, 2013, we entered into a new three-year
lease with 1 st  Manatee Bank (the  New Lease ). 1 st  Manatee Bank intended to operate a branch at
the Building, its establishment of the branch being subject to approval by the FDIC and the OFR. 1 st  Manatee filed an
application for regulatory approval on October 6, 2013, and received such approval as of December 6, 2013. Under the New Lease,
the initial three-year term, and the tenant s obligation to pay rent, began December 6, 2013. 1 st  Manatee retroactively
made its December rent payment in January 2014. 

The Building was sold on
September 29, 2015, for a gross purchase price of $2.1 million. Using the approximately $538,000 in net proceeds from the sale
of the Building, we (a) declared and paid, on November 2, 2015, a cash dividend of $0.27 per share of Common Stock for a total
of approximately $490,000 and (b) repaid $40,000 in advances owed to certain current and former of our directors and all other
outstanding accounts payable. As a result, we began fiscal year 2016 with approximately $47,000 in cash. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2015,
as of the date of this Report, the following event is hereby reported: 

Effective March 21, 2016, we sold 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock to three members of our Board
of Directors (Charles S. Conoley, M. Shannon Glasgow and Barclay Kirkland, D.D.S.) and Daniel D. Dinur, for the purchase price
of $.01 per share in a private placement. We intend to use the proceeds from such sale, as well as any remaining proceeds from
the sale of the Building, to defray the costs of restoring the Company s compliance with the reporting requirements under
the Exchange Act.   

In the wake of the Company s
sale of the Building and the subsequent distribution of the special dividend, management began to consider the future of the Company
as a viable entity. In early March 2016, management decided that it would not be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders
to cease all operations and allow the Company to become defunct, similar to the overwhelming majority of the other community bank
holding companies which lost their bank subsidiaries in the Great Recession. Instead, the conclusion was reached that the Company
could serve as the surviving entity in a merger or other combination with an operating company, the management of which was desirous
of attaining public company status for the operating company. Such combination with the right operating company would, management
believed, give our shareholders a chance to recover at least some portion of their original investment in the Company by participating
in the future financial results of the chosen operating company. 

10   

Because any such operating
company would by definition require that, at the time of the merger, the Company is a fully-reporting public company, management
resolved to undertake the effort and the expense of restoring the Company s compliance with its reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act. In the absence of cash on hand or borrowing capacity to defray the cost of such restoration, the Board of Directors
inquired whether any of its members would be willing to take the risk of investing in the Company cash sufficient to effect such
restoration  and  to keep the Company compliant through fiscal 2016, there being no assurance that the Company would be able
to find the right operating company and complete a merger during 2016. Three of the members of the Board of Directors, and Daniel D.
Dinur, the Company s outside corporate counsel, did then, in March 2016, invest $20,000 in the Company by purchasing shares
of Common Stock at a purchase per share which exceeded the then trading price of such stock by over 200%. Mr. Conoley also agreed
to continue to serve as our President and CEO without compensation through the end of 2016. 

As of the date of this
Report, management is continuing in its efforts to identify a potential merger partner whose prospects for growth and other attributes
would give our shareholders the optimal chance for recovering, over time, some portion of their original investment in the Company.
There is no assurance that we will identify the appropriate operating company, negotiate a fair merger deal and consummate the
transaction in the near future. 

Results of Operations.  

Overall Net Income.  

The Company reported net
income of $550,148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to net income of $23,891 for the nine months ended September
30, 2014. In each period, net income was the result of income from discontinued operations (mainly a gain from the sale of the
Building)  plus  minimal other miscellaneous income -- $1,094,847  plus  $265 and $90,747  plus  $176, respectively
-- being offset by a loss from operations  plus  the write-off of the deferred tax asset -- $101,819  plus  $442,520
and $66,856  plus  $0, respectively. Basic and diluted gains per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $0.31.
Basic and diluted losses per share were $0.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. 

The Company reported net
income of $534,140 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to net income of $6,779 for the three months ended September
30, 2014. Similarly to the nine-month results, in each period, net income was the result of income from discontinued operations
 plus  minimal other miscellaneous income -- $1,032,287 plus $99 and $29,888 plus $60, respectively -- being offset by a loss
from operations  plus  write-off of the deferred tax asset -- $73,876  plus  $424,271 and $23,909  plus  $0, respectively.
Basic and diluted gains per share for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were $0.30. Basic and diluted earnings per share
were negligible for the three months ended September 30, 2014. 

Total Assets.  

As of September 30, 2015,
total assets of the Company were $548,336 compared to $1,490,189 at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $941,803. This decrease is
primarily due to the sale of the Building on September 29, 2015 and the write off of the deferred tax asset. 

Liquidity   Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2015,
we had a working capital excess of $518,396. We realized net income of $550,148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared
to net income of $23,891 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure About Market Risk.   

Not applicable.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.   

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Within the 90 days preceding the filing of this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Acting Chief Financial Officer (Principal
Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule
13(a)-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, because of lack of segregation of duties attributable to limited
resources and limited number of employees, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as
of September 30, 2015. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures.   

Our management, including
our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited
to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. 

Changes in Internal Controls.   

There have been no changes
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2015 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
