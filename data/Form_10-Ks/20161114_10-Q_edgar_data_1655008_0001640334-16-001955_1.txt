     Table of Contents           HAHA GENERATION CORP.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (UNAUDITED)       NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These unaudited financial statements, footnote disclosures, and other information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.       Organization       HAHA Generation Corp., a company in the developmental stage (the  Company ), was incorporated on June 10, 2014 in the State of Nevada. The Company has conducted limited business operations and had no revenues from operations since its inception. The Company s business plan is to distribute fabrics that were made out of silicon crystals.       Going Concern       These financial statements were prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $252,848 and $201,098 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and it had no revenue from operations.     The Company faces all the risks common to companies at development stage, including capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources, high initial expenditure levels, uncertain revenue streams, and difficulties in managing growth. The Company's losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from a loan commitment of $100,000 from Hsuan-Hsien Liao, our President and sole director, which commitment is for 12 months, and all amounts lent by Ms. Liao pursuant to that commitment shall not accrue interest and shall be payable on demand; provided however, such command will not be made prior to the expiration of that 12 month period after the date of that commitment, which date was March 31, 2016.                     7       
     Table of Contents         The Company believes its current and future plans enable it to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this time. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts which may differ from those in the accompanying financial statements.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.       Net Income (loss) per Share       Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company does not have any outstanding common stock equivalents; therefore, a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented        Income Taxes       Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were $0 as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       Reclassifications       Certain classifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.                 8       
     Table of Contents           Recent Accounting Pronouncements       The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its result of operations, financial position or cash flow.      NOTE 2. DUE TO RELATED PARTY      From March 2014 to the present, Hsuan-Hsien Liao, our President and sole director, has been the marketing director for, and a member of the Board of Directors of, Shinin Silica Co., Ltd.,  Shinin Silica , a Taiwanese Company. On November 25, 2014, the Company entered a tentative agreement with Shinin Silica for a business cooperation. The agreement was canceled and the prepayment was returned in excess of $3,186 in March 2015.       NOTE 3. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY      On June 12, 2014, the Company issued 10,000 shares of its common stock to its then sole director for $1,000 cash. On July 23, 2014, that director sold those shares to his daughter, the Company s current president and sole director, for $1,000 cash.     On December 8, 2014, the Company issued 197,281 shares of common stock to thirty-two shareholders for $197,281 in cash.     On May 5, 2015, the Company issued 3,000 shares of common stock to three shareholders for $3,000 in cash.     On April 30, 2016, the Company issued 89,375 shares of common stock to fifty-two shareholders for $111,719 in cash.     On June 20, 2016, the Company, pursuant to action by a Written Consent of Sole Director, filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized number of shares of the Company's common stock to 25,000,000 and effectuate a forward stock split on a 5 for 1 basis (the "Certificate"). Pursuant to the Certificate, the authorized number of shares of the Company's common stock is increased to 25,000,000, par value $0.1, and the Company issues 5 shares for every 1 share of the Company's common stock that was issued and outstanding (the "Forward Stock Split"). No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Forward Stock Split.      NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $252,848 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.                  9       
     Table of Contents          The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following for the nine months ended September 30:           The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:           The difference between the effective rate reflected in the provision for income taxes on loss before taxes and the amounts determined by applying the applicable statutory U.S. tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are analyzed below:           For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties expenses. Currently, the Company is not subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.      NOTE 5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date which the financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent events requiring recognition as of September 30, 2016 have been incorporated into these financial statements and there are no subsequent events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855,  Subsequent Events.       ******                  Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.         Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements       This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this discussion and analysis by management, contains or incorporates forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made in report are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  believes,   estimates,   could,   possibly,   probably,  anticipates,   projects,   expects,   may,   will,  or  should  or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations.      The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.      Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015      Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was $0. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $23, as compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.     General and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal and professional service fees. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $14,950, as compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in those expenses was primarily attributable to accounting, legal and professional fees.     Our net loss was $(14,927) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was a result of the increase in general and administrative expenses.      Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015      Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $0. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $23, as compared to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      General and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal and professional service fees. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $51,773, as compared to $10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in those expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in accounting, legal and professional fees.             Our net loss was $(51,750) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $(10) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was a result of the increase in general and administrative expenses.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      Cash and cash equivalents were $65,887 at September 30, 2016, and $3,369 at December 31, 2015. Our total current assets were $70,837 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,369 at December 31, 2015. Our total current liabilities were $10,686 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,186 at December 31, 2015.      We had working capital of $60,151 at September 30, 2016, compared to working capital of $183 at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to cash provided by the sale of our common stock.     Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $(49,200), compared to $(10) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net losses.      Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $111,718, compared to $3,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which change was primarily due to cash received from the issuance of our common stock.     Net change in cash and cash equivalents was an increase of $62,518 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,990 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which change was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of our common stock.      Inflation      Our opinion is that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations and is not expected to have any material effect on our operations.      Climate Change      Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.       Item 4.

Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.      There was no change to our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
