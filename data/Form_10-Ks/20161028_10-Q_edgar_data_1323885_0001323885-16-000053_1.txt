1. DESC    RIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Nature of the Business   AtriCure, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 31, 2000. The  Company  or  AtriCure  consists of AtriCure, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company is   a    leading atrial fibrillation (Afib) solutions partner providing innovative products, professional education and support for clinical science to reduce the economic and social burden of atrial fibrillation. The Company sells its products to medical centers globally through a direct sales force and distributors. 

Basis of Presentation   The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of the Company s management, contain all of the normal, recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) applicable to interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted or condensed. The Company believes the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or for any future period.  

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.    

Principles of Consolidation   The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, AtriCure, LLC, Endoscopic Technologies, LLC and nContact Surgical, LLC, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries, all organized in the State of Delaware, AtriCure Europe B.V. (AtriCure Europe), the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in the Netherlands  , AtriCure Spain, S.L., AtriCure Europe s wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Spain   and AtriCure Hong Kong Limited, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong  . All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition as cash equivalents in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Investments   The Company places its investments primarily in U.S. Government agencies and securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper. The Company classifies all investments as available-for-sale. Investments with maturities of less than   one   year are classified as short-term investments. Investments are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recognizes gains and losses when these securities are sold using the specific identification method and includes them in interest income or expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

Revenue Recognition   The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605,  Revenue Recognition  (ASC 605). The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Pursuant to the Company s standard terms of sale, revenue is recognized when title to the goods and risk of loss transfers to customers and there are no remaining obligations that will affect the customers  final acceptance of the sale. Generally, the Company s standard terms of sale define the transfer of title and risk of loss to occur upon shipment to the respective customer. The Company does not   normally   maintain any post-shipping obligations to the recipients of the products. No installation, calibration or testing of products is performed by the Company subsequent to shipment to the customer in order to render it operational.  

Revenue includes shipping and handling revenue of   $306   and   $260   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, and   $931   and   $778   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cost of freight for shipments made to customers is included in cost of revenue. Sales and other value-added taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. The Company sells its products primarily through a direct sales force, with certain international markets sold through distributors. Terms of sale are generally consistent for both end-users and distributors except that payment terms are generally net   30   days for end-users and net   60   days for distributors with limited exceptions.    

Sales Returns and Allowances   The Company maintains a provision for sales returns and allowances to account for potential returns of defective or damaged products, products shipped in error and invoice adjustments. The Company estimates such provision on a quarterly basis based primarily on specific identification, in addition to estimating a general reserve based on historical

(In thousands, except per share amounts) 

(Unaudited)  

experience. Increases to the provision result in a reduction of revenue. The provision is included in accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable   The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable to determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the reserve, the Company considers aging of account balances, historical credit losses, customer-specific information and other relevant factors. An increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts results in a corresponding increase in selling, general and administrative expense. The Company reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance based on current circumstances and charges off uncollectible receivables against the allowance when all attempts to collect the receivable have failed. The Company s history of write-offs against the allowance has not been significant. 

Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using approximate costs based on the first-in, first-out cost method (FIFO). Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. The Company s industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of product approvals, variability in product launch strategies and variation in product utilization all impact excess and obsolete inventory. An inventory allowance based on product usage is estimated and recorded quarterly for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value. An increase to the inventory reserve allowance results in a corresponding increase in cost of revenue. Write-offs are recorded when a product is destroyed. The Company s history of write-offs against the reserve has not been significant.  

Inventories consist of the following: 

Property and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method of depreciation for financial reporting purposes and is applied over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life by major asset category is the following: generators and other capital equipment   is   one   to   three   years  , machinery, equipment and vehicles is   three   to   seven   years, computer and other office equipment is   three   years, furniture and fixtures is   three   to   seven   years and leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases are the shorter of their useful life or remaining lease term. The Company reassesses the useful lives of property and equipment annually, and assets are retired if they are no longer in service. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  

Generators and other capital equipment (such as the Company s switchbox units and cryosurgical consoles) are placed with direct customers that use the Company s disposable products. Depreciation of such assets is included in cost of revenue. The estimated useful lives of this equipment are based on anticipated usage by customers and the timing and impact of expected new technology rollouts by the Company. To the extent the Company experiences changes in the usage of this equipment or introduces new technologies, the estimated useful lives of this equipment may change in a future period. Depreciation related to these generators was   $914   and   $733   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $2,629   and   $2,026   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net carrying amount of loaned equipment included in net property and equipment in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was   $5,767   and   $5,447  , respectively. 

The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment using its best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections.  

Intangible Assets   Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. 

Included in intangible assets is In Process Research and Development (IPR D). The Company defines IPR D as the value of acquired technology which has not yet reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility is obtaining specific regulatory approvals. The estimated fair value of IPR D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the IPR D project. Upon completion of the development project, the IPR D is amortized over its estimated useful life. If the IPR D project is abandoned, the related IPR D

(Unaudited)  

asset is written off. The estimated fair value of IPR D was determined using an income approach model   and   represents an estimate of the fair value of the PMA approval that could result from the CONVERGE IDE clinical trial.  

The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment using its best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. 

Goodwill   Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on November 30, or more often if impairment indicators are present. The Company s goodwill is accounted for in a single reporting unit representing the Company as a whole.  

Other Noncurrent Liabilities   Other noncurrent liabilities include contingent consideration recorded in business combinations, as well as long-term deferred revenues and other contractual obligations. 

Other Income     Other income consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The   Company recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of   $31   and   $48   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $146   and   $257   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with settlements of its intercompany balance with AtriCure Europe and   sales   invoices transacted in British Pounds.  

Taxes   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The Company s estimate of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires it to make significant estimates and judgments about its future operating results. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering all available evidence. Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable. The sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carry-back years and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible. In evaluating whether to record a valuation allowance, the applicable accounting standards deem that the existence of cumulative losses in recent years is a significant piece of objectively verifiable negative evidence that must be overcome by objectively verifiable positive evidence to avoid the need to record a valuation allowance. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized in future periods. 

A provision of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as   amended (Patient Act), required   manufacturers of medical devices to pay an excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales. In December 2015, the U.S. gove  rnment approved the suspension of the excise tax on medical device sales beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017.   The Company s expense related to the medical device excise tax, which was recorded in cost of revenue, was   $0   and   $164   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $0   and   $468   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Net Loss Per Share   Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  (ASC 260) by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Since the Company has experienced net losses for all periods presented, net loss per share excludes the effect of   4,433   and   4,243   stock options and restricted stock shares as of   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because they are anti-dilutive. Therefore the number of shares calculated for basic net loss per share is also used for the diluted net loss per share calculation. 

Comprehensive Loss and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss   In addition to net losses, the comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments.

(Unaudited)  

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following:  

Research and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include compensation and other internal and external costs associated with the development and research related to new and existing products or concepts, preclinical studies, clinical trials, healthcare compliance and regulatory affairs. 

Advertising Costs      The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were not significant during the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015. 

Share-Based Compensation   The Company follows FASB ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation  (ASC 718) to record share-based compensation for all employee share-based payment awards, including stock options, restricted stock and stock purchases related to an employee stock purchase plan, based on estimated fair values. The Company s share-based compensation expense recognized under ASC 718 for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015 was   $2,927   and   $2,392  , respectively, and   $8,796   and   $6,533  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, on a before and after tax basis.  

ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

The Company estimates the fair value of time-based options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Black-Scholes model). The Company s determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include but are not limited to the Company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The fair value of market-based performance option grants is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

The Company estimates the fair value of restricted stock based upon the grant date closing market price of the Company s common stock. The Company s determination of fair value is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding the number of shares expected to be granted.  

The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) which is available to all eligible employees as defined by the plan document. Under the ESPP, shares of the Company s common stock may be purchased at a discount. The Company estimates the number of shares to be purchased under the ESPP and records compensation expense based upon the fair value of the stock at the beginning of the purchase period using the Black-Scholes model.

Use of Estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Fair Value Disclosures   The Company classifies and records cash and investments in U.S. government agencies and securities as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Accounts receivable, short-term other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are also classified as Level 1. The carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities approximate their fair value due to their relatively short-term nature. Cash equivalents and investments in corporate bonds   and commercial paper   are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy (see Note 3   Fair Value for further information).   The book value of the Company s fixed interest rate debt approximates its fair value   as of   September   30, 2016  .     Fixed interest rate debt fair value is determined by calculating the net present value of future debt payments and is classified as Level 2.   Significant unobservable inputs with respect to the   Level 3   fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability is developed using Company data. When an input is changed, the corresponding valuation models are updated and the results are analyzed for reasonableness. 

2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In May 2014 the FASB issued a final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. The standard, issued as FASB ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09), outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015 the   FASB   defer  red   the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP from interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allow early adoption as of the original effective date. A full retrospective or modified retrospective approach may be taken to adopt the guidance in the ASU. FASB ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net) , FASB ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and FASB ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , have been issued in 2016 to further refine the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of the revenue-related ASUs on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 

In November 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  (ASU 2015-17), which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. Also, companies will no longer allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets because those allowances also will be classified as noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company has evaluated the impact of the provisions of ASU 2015-17 on its consolidated financial position and related disclosures and has determined that the new guidance does not have a material impact on its financial reporting. 

In January 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments   Overall   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU 2016-01), which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.   Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends   certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company   has   evaluat  ed   the impact of ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial position and related disclosures   and has determined that the new guidance does not have a material impact on its financial reporting  . 

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases      (ASU 2016-02) which requires lessees to record most leases onto their balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statement in a manner similar to today s accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited. The Company is evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-02 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position and related disclosures.    

In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  (ASU 2016-09), which changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled  , which will be applied prospectively  .

The guidance   also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting  . Companies will apply the guidance to outstanding liability awards at the date of adoption using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The new guidance also allows companies   to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimate for expense recognition.   Companies will make this election at the entity level using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.   ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, however, all of the guidance within the ASU must be adopted in the same period. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 

In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  (ASU 2016-13), which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard replaces   the    incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model for instruments measured at amortized cost and requires entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model. It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.   The standard s provisions are to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (modified   retrospective approach).     ASU 2016-13 is effective for   fiscal years   beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein.     Early adoption is permitted for   fiscal years   beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. The Company   has   evaluat  ed   the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures   and has determined that the new guidance does not have a material impact on its financial reporting  . 

In   August   2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-1  5  ,    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    (ASU 2016-1  5  ), which   amends Accounting Standards Concept 230  ,  Statement of Cash Flows    (ASC 230)  ,   to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. ASC 230 lacks consistent principles for evaluating the classification of cash payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows. Therefore, the FASB issued the ASU with the intent of reducing diversity in practice.   ASU 2016-1  5   is effective for   fiscal years   beginning after December 15, 201  7  , and interim periods therein.     Early adoption is permitted  .     The guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application is impracticable.   The Company   has   evaluat  ed   the impact of ASU 2016-1  5   on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures   and has determined that the new guidance does not have a material impact on its financial reporting  . 

3. FAIR VALUE  

FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  (ASC 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:  

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The valuation under this approach does not entail a significant degree of judgment.      

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The valuation technique for the Company s Level 2 assets is based on quoted market prices for similar assets from observable pricing sources at the reporting date.     

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. The fair value of the Company s contingent consideration   liability   was estimated on the acquisition date of   nContact Surgical, Inc. (nContact)     using Level 3 inputs  .

In accordance with ASC 820, the following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September   30, 2016  :   

There were no changes in the levels or methodology of measurement of financial assets and liabilities during the three   or   nine     month period  s   ended     September 30, 2016  . 

In accordance with ASC 820, the following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015:  

There were no changes in the levels or methodology of measurement of financial assets and liabilities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. 

Acquisition-Re  lated Contingent Consideration.   Contingent consideration arrangements obligate the Company to pay former shareholders of an acquired entity if specified future events occur or conditions are met, such as the achievement of certain technological milestones or the achievement of targeted revenue milestones. The Company measures such liabilities using unobservable inputs, applying the income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique or the probability-weighted scenario method. Various key assumptions, such as the probability of achievement of the milestones, projected revenues from acquisitions and the discount rate, are used in the determination of fair value of contingent consideration arrangements and are not observable in the market, thus representing a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Subsequent revisions to key assumptions, which impact the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company acquired nContact on October 13, 2015. The aggregate consideration paid to nContact shareholders includes up to   $50,000   in contingent consideration based on completion of enrollment of the CONVERGE IDE trial and corresponding PMA approval by December 31, 2020. nContact shareholders are   also   entitled to additional contingent consideration based on specified product revenue in excess of an annual growth rate of more than   25%   through 2019. There were no changes in the   underlying

5. ACCRUED LIABILITIES  

Accrued liabilities consisted of the following:  

6. INDEBTEDNESS 

Bank Credit Facility.     The Company has a debt agreement   (Loan Agreement)   with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The   Loan A  greement, as amended, restated and modified,   effective April 25, 2016,   includes a   $25,000   term loan and   $15,000   revolvi  ng line of credit, both which mature     i  n    April 2021  . Borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of $15,000 or a borrowing base calculation as defined by the   Loan A  greement. As of   September 30, 2016   the Company had   no   borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had borrowing   availability   of $15,000. The   revolving   line of credit is subject to an annual commitment fee of   $50  , and any borrowings bear interest at the Prime Rate. Financing costs related to the revolving line of credit are included in other assets in the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   and amortized ratably over the term of the Loan Agreement.    

The term loan has a   five  -year term, with principal payments to be made ratably commencing   twelve   months after the inception of the loan through to the loan s maturity date. If the Company meets certain conditions, as specified by the Loan Agreement, the commencement of term loan principal payments may be deferred by an additional   six   months.   The term loan accrues interest at the Prime Rate and is subject to an additional   4.0%   fee on the original $25,000 term loan principal amount at maturity   or prepayment of the term loan. The Company is accruing the 4.0% fee over the term of the Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued   $87   of this fee and included it in the outstanding loan balance in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financing costs related to the term loan are net against the outstanding loan balance in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized ratably over the term of the Loan Agreement.  

The   Loan Agreement also provides for certain prepayment and early termination fees, as well as establishes covenants related to liquidity, sales growth and a minimum cash balance, and includes other customary terms and conditions. Specified assets have been pledged as collateral. 

Capital Lease Obligations.     As of   September 30, 2016   the Company had capital leases for   its corporate headquarters building and   computer equipment that expire at various terms through   2030  .   

In August 2014 t  he Company entered into a new building lease (Mason Lease) in order to re-locate its   corporate   headquarters and West Chester, Ohio facilities from their current location to a building to be constructed in Mason, Ohio. The term of the Mason Lease is   fifteen   years with   three   separate   five  -year renewal options, at the Company s option, and   commenced   in   Octo  ber 2015. On the   Commencement Date, the Company   provide  d   a letter of credit to the Landlord in the amount of   $1,250  , which amount may

decrease or be removed entirely based on the Company s financial performance. The Company   wa  s deemed the owner of the project during the construction period. As a result, project costs incurred   during construction of the building were   included in property and equipment   as construction in progress   and the   corresponding   financing obligation   wa  s included in other current liabilities   during the construction period  .    I  ncrease  s   in purchases of building under construction and proceeds from the construction financing obligation   we  re also included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows   during the construction period  .   Upon completion of construction, t  he Company   recor  ded the current and noncurrent portions of the Mason Lease obligation within capital leases and the va  lue of the underlying asset in p  roperty and   e  quipment in the   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheet  .   

At September 30, 2016 t  he cost of the   leased   assets  , both building and computer equipment,   was   $14,477  . The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equal the terms of the leases. Accumulated amortization on the capital leases was   $1,027   at   September 30, 2016  .   

Future maturities on capital lease obligations are projected as follows:  

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Lease Commitments  .     The Company leases   certain   office, manufacturing and warehouse facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various terms through   2021  .   

Royalty Agreements  .    The Company has certain royalty agreements in place with terms that include payment of royalties based on product revenue from sales of specified current products. The royalty agreements have effective dates as early as 2003 and terms ranging from   three   years to at least   twenty   years. The royalties range from   0.75%   to   5%   of specified product sales. Parties to the royalty agreements have the right at any time to terminate the agreement immediately for cause. Royalty expense of   $499   and   $423   was recorded as part of cost of revenue for the   three months ended September 30,   201  6    and 2015, respectively  .     Royalty expense of   $1,385   and   $1,321   was recorded as part of cost of revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively  . 

Purchase   Agreements  .     The Company enters into standard purchase agreements with certain vendors in the ordinary course of business.     Outstanding commitments at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were not significant. 

Legal  .    The Company is not currently party to any material pending or threatened litigation.   The Company may, from time to time, become a party to legal proceedings.  

8. INCOME TAX PROVISION 

The Company files federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes , under which deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured using provisions of currently enacted tax laws. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will not be fully realized. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as it is more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized in future periods. Tax credits are accounted for as a reduction of income taxes in the year in which the credit originates.  

The Company s provision for income taxes for continuing operations in interim periods is computed by applying its estimated annual effective rate against its loss before income tax (expense) benefit for the period. In addition, non-recurring or discrete items are

recorded during the period in which they occur. The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   (0.03%)   and   (0.09%)  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015 was   (0.10%)   and   (  0.12%  )  , respectively.  

The Company has not had to accrue any interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of offsetting of net operating losses. However, if the situation occurs, the Company will recognize interest and penalties within the income tax expense (benefit) line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and within the related tax liability line in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Federal, state and local tax returns of the Company are routinely subject to review by various taxing authorities. The Internal Revenue Service is reviewing the Company s 2014 federal tax return. 

9. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS 

The Company has several share-based incentive plans: the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan), the   Second   Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (2014 Plan) and the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).  

Equity Incentive   Plan  s 

The Company granted awards under the 2005 Plan until the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which stockholders adopted the 2014 Plan. Pursuant to its terms, the 2014 Plan supersedes and replaces the 2005 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant incentive stock options to employees and any parent or subsidiary s employees, and may grant nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and any parent or subsidiary s employees, directors and consultants. The administrator (currently the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) has the power to determine the terms of any awards, including the number of shares subject to each award, the exercisability of the awards and the form of consideration. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   9,399   shares of common stock had been reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan.  

Options granted under the plans generally expire   ten     years fr  om the   date   of grant. Options granted from the   2005   Plan and 2014 Plan generally vest at a rate of   25%   on the first anniversary date of the grant and ratably each month thereafter over the following   three     years  . Restricted stock awards granted under the   2005   Plan and   2014   Plan generally vest   25%   annually over   four   years from date of grant. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

T  he   ESPP   is available to eligible employees as defined in the   plan document  . Under the ESPP, shares of the Company s common stock may be purchased at a discount (currently   15%  ) of the lesser of the closing price of the Company s common stock on the first trading day or the last trading day of the offering period. The offering period (currently   six   months) and the offering price are subject to change.   Participants may not purchase more than   $25   of the Company s common stock in a calendar year and may not purchase a value of more than   3   shares during an offering period.   Beginning on January 1, 2009 and on the first day of each fiscal year thereafter during the term of the ESPP, the number of shares available for sale under the ESPP shall be increased by the lesser of (i) two percent (  2%  ) of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock as of the close of business on the last business day of the prior calendar year, not to exceed   600   shares, or (ii) a lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors.

Overview  

We are a   leading atrial fibrillation (Afib) solutions partner providing innovative products, professional education and support for clinical science to reduce the economic and social burden of atrial fibrillation.   We have   several   product lines for the ablation of cardiac tissue  , including our Isolator        Synergy    Ablation System, the first and only surgical device approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent and longstanding persistent forms of Afib in patients undergoing certain open concomitant procedures. We also offer a variety of minimally invasive ablation devices and access tools to facilitate the growing trend in less invasive cardiac and thoracic surgery. Our cryoICE      cryosurgery   product line   offers a variety of   cryoablation devices.   Our AtriClip      Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion System is the most widely sold device worldwide specifically designed to occlude the heart s left atrial appendage (LAA). We believe cardiothoracic surgeons are adopting our ablation and LAA management (LAAM) devices for the treatment of Afib and reduction of Afib-related complications such as stroke. 

Cardiothoracic surgeons have adopted our   radiofrequency ablation   and cryoablation systems to treat A  fib   in   over 210,000   patients since   2004  , and we believe that we are currently the market leader in the surgical treatment of A  fib  . Our products are utilized by cardiothoracic surgeons during   both   open-heart   and   minimally invasive   surgical   procedures  , either on a concomitant or sole-therapy basis  . During a concomitant procedure, the surgeon ablates cardiac tissue and/or   oc  clude  s the left atrial appendage, secondary, or concomitant, to a primary cardiac procedure such as a valve   repair or replacement   or coronary   artery   bypass   graft (CABG)  . Our   Isolator   Synergy System is   approved     by   FDA   for the treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent Afib concomitant to other open-heart surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve replacement or repair.   To date, none of our other products have been approved or cleared by FDA   specifically   for the treatment of A  fib  .    Our 510(k)-cleared RF and cryo ablation products are indicated for the ablation of cardiac tissue and/or treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, our cryoICE probe is cleared for blocking pain by temporarily ablating peripheral nerves. Our AtriClip products are 510(k)-cleared with an indication for occlusion of the LAA, under direct visualization, concomitant to other open cardiac surgical procedures.   In October 2015 we   acquired nContact, a leader in minimally invasive technology for epicardial ablation. We also have a line of reusable surgical instruments typically used for cardiac valve replacement or repair.   We anticipate that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will relate to products we currently sell, or are in the process of developing, which surgeons use to   ablate cardiac tissue,     to   oc  clude   the left atrial appendage  , to perform mitral and aortic valve replacement and repair and/or to ablate peripheral nerves during cardiothoracic surgery.  

In the United States we sell our products to medical centers through our direct sales force.   I  n certain   international   markets, such as Germany  , France, the United Kingdom   and the Benelux region,   sales are made   directly to medical centers  , with the remaining   international   sales being made through distributors who in turn sell   our products   to end users  . Our business is primarily transacted in U.S.   Dollars   with the exception of transactions with our European subsidiary which are transacted in Euros   or British Pounds  .

Recent Developments 

We submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application for the Staged DEEP   AF   pivotal trial to FDA in May 2014. The Staged DEEP   AF   pivotal trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Isolator Synergy System when used in a staged approach, where a minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed  ,   and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 90-120 days later. FDA approval to enroll up to 220 subjects at 23 domestic medical centers and two international medical centers was received   during the third quarter of   2014.   Enrollment began during the first quarter of 2015, and there are   currently 41 patients   enrolled   and   thirteen   sites   initiated. Enrollment has been temporarily suspended while we evaluate changes to the trial protocol with FDA. 

We are   also conducting the   ATLAS study, which is a non-IDE randomized pilot study evaluating outcomes of patients with risk factors for developing postoperative Afib as well as risk of bleeding on oral anticoagulation. There are two types of patients subject to this study:  those   with a postoperative Afib diagnosis and   receiving prophylactic exclusion of the left atrial appendage with the AtriClip device concomitant to cardiac surgery and those with a postoperative Afib diagnosis who are medically managed. At full capacity, we expect to enroll approximately 2,000 patients at up to twenty sites. We began enrollment in February 2016, and there   are   currently   91   patient  s   enrolled and   nine   sites initiated. 

We are in the beginning stages of our cryoanalgesia study (FROST), which is a non-IDE randomized pilot study evaluating whether intraoperative intercostal cryoanalgesia in conjunction with standard of care provides improved analgesic efficacy in patients undergoing unilateral thoracotomy cardiac procedures as compared to current standard of care. The study will involve treatment arm subjects who will receive intercostal cryoanalgesia in conjunction with standard post-operative pain management and control arm subjects who will receive standard post-operative pain management only. At full capacity, we expect to enroll   100   patients at up to five sites. We   began enrollment in June 2016, and there are currently thirteen patients enrolled and three sites initiated.    

W  e are   also   pursuing a   non-IDE   trial in Europe,   C  EASE   AF  , to compare   staged hybrid ablation   treatment   (minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 91-180 days later) versus catheter ablation alone  .    We expect the study to have an enrollment of approximately 210 patients across ten sites. There are currently 34 patients enrolled   and   eleven   sites   initiated.  

With the acquisition of nContact, we are conducting the CONVERGE IDE clinical trial. The CONVERGE pivotal trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the   EPi-Sense      Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax        technology to treat symptomatic persistent Afib patients who are refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I and/or III anti-arrhythmic drug. We have   FDA approval to enroll up to 153 subjects at fifteen domestic medical centers and two international medical centers  .    We recently received approval from FDA to increase the number of trial sites to 27 domestic medical centers and three international medical centers.   Enrollment began during the first quarter of 2014, and there are   currently   51   patients enrolled and   fifteen   domestic   sites initiated.  

The FDA conducted an inspection in our Cincinnati, Ohio facility from August 3, 2016 through August 29, 2016. This audit resulted in the issuance of a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which outlined certain nonconformance items within our   Medical Device Reporting (  MDR  )   and risk mitigation processes as observed by the FDA inspector. We responded to the observations and have taken corrective actions where appropriate.   We take   these matters seriously,   and we   will respond timely and fully to any additional FDA requests  .     We   believe that FDA s concerns will be resolved without a material impact on   our   financial results.

Results of Operations 

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015    

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and as percentages of total revenue: 

Revenue.   Total revenue   increased   22.0%     (  22.0% on a constant currency basis)   from   $31,423   for the three   months ended September 30, 2015   to   $38,340 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Constant currency basis amounts are calculated by applying previous period foreign currency exchange rates to each of the comparable periods. Revenue from sales to customers in the United States increased $5,910  , or   24.0%  , and   revenue from sales to international customers   increased   $1,007  ,    or   14.9%    (  14.7%   on a constant   currency basis).   The increase in sales to customers in the United States was primarily due to increased sales of ablation-related open-heart products of   $1,725, increased sales of ablation-related minimally invasive (MIS) products of $2,506   and increased sales of the AtriClip system of   $1,794  .    The increase in MIS sales was   largely   influenced by the nContact acquisition  , which   closed in the fourth quarter of 2015.   The increase   in international revenue was primarily due to increase  d   sales   in Japan,   Italy, Russia and France  . 

Cost of revenue and gross margin.   Cost of revenue   increased   $1,923  , from   $8,945   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $10,868   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .    As a percentage of revenue, cost of   revenue   in  creased   from   28.5%   for the three months ended   September 30  , 201  5   to   28.3%   for the thre  e months ended   September 30, 2016  . Gross margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   71.7%   and     71.5%  ,   respectively.   The   in  crease   in gross margin was primarily due   to   the repeal of the medical device excise tax in 2016 and a slightly higher domestic sales mix. This increase was partially offset by   heavier loaner generator depreciation and increased costs related to moving into a larger and more modern facility. 

Research and de  velopment expenses.   Research and development expenses   increased   $1,767  ,    or 27.2%,   from   $6,504   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015     to   $8,271   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in expense was primarily due to a   $  501   increase   in product development, regulatory and clinical personnel expense, a $  530   increase in product development project expense  ,     a $384 increase in clinical trial expense,   a  n    $  84   increase in share-based compensation   and a   $111 increase   in amortization expense as a result of the nContact acquisition  .    

Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses in  creased   $3,386  , or   15.3%  , from   $22,101   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $25,487   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $  1,886   increase in personnel   and related   expense  s, such as travel costs,   a $  466   increase in share-based compensation expense   and a $919 increase in marketing, tradeshows, training and related, partially offset by a $526 decrease in expense due to transaction costs recorded in connection with the acquisition of nContact during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net interest (expense) income.   Net interest (expense) income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $(463)   and   $40, respectively.   Interest expense associated with   outstanding amounts on our term loan and   capital lease obligations  , as well as  

21   

Table of Contents  

the amortization of financing costs  ,   are included in net interest expense  . The increase in interest expense was driven by the commencement of the Mason facility capital lease in late 2015 and the addition of the term loan in April 2016. 

Other income and expense.   Other income and expense consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Net other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $32   and   $48, respectively. 

Nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and as percentages of total revenue: 

Revenue.   Total revenue   increased   21.4%     (  21.3% on a constant currency basis)   from   $93,892   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $113,952 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Constant currency basis amounts are calculated by applying previous period foreign currency exchange rates to each of the comparable periods. Revenue from sales to customers in the United States increased $16,387  , or   22.3%  , and   revenue from sales to international customers   increased   $3,673  , or   17.9%    (  17.6%   on   a constant currency basis).   The increase in sales to customers in the United States was primarily due to increased sales of ablation-related open-heart products of   $4,412, increased sales of ablation-related minimally invasive (MIS) products of $7,817   and increased sales of the AtriClip system of   $4,201  .    The increase in MIS sales was   largely   influenced by the nContact acquisition  , which   closed in the fourth quarter of 2015.   The increase   in international revenue was primarily due to increase  d   sales   in Japan, China,   Italy   and France. 

Cost of revenue and gross margin.   Cost of revenue   increased   $5,186  , from   $26,562   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $31,748   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . As a percen  tage of revenue, cost of   revenue   de  creased   from   28.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 201  5   to   27.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Gross margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   72.1%   and     71.7%  ,   respectively.   The   in  crease   in gross margin was primarily due   to the elimination of certain scrap and obsolescence charges (primarily related to non-core or Estech products), as well as the repeal of the medical device excise tax, all which were included in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by heavier loaner generator depreciation and increased costs related to moving into a larger and more modern facility. 

Research and de  velopment expenses.   Research and development expenses   increased   $7,983  ,    or 44.4%,   from   $17,975   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015     to   $25,958   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in expense was primarily due to a $  2,715   increase in product development, regulatory and clinical personnel expense, a $  1,602   increase in product development project expense  ,     a $1,507 increase in clinical trial expense, a $239 increase in regulatory filing expense,   a $  370   increase in share-based compensation   and a $332 increase in amortization expense as a result of the nContact acquisition  .

Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses in  creased   $14,244  , or   21.8%  , from   $65,445   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $79,689   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to   a $  8,161   increase   in personnel   and related   expense  s,     such as travel costs,   a $  1,877   increase in share-based compensation expense   and a $2,043 increase in marketing, tradeshows, training and related expenses, partially offset by a $526 decrease in expense due to transaction costs recorded in connection with the acquisition of nContact during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net interest (expense) income.   Net interest (expense) income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $(1,100)   and   $91, respectively.   Interest expense associated with   outstanding amounts on our term loan and   capital lease obligations  , as well as   the amortization of financing costs  ,   are included in net interest expense  . The increase in interest expense was driven by the commencement of the Mason facility capital lease in late 2015 and the addition of the term loan in April 2016. 

Other income and expense.   Other income and expense consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Non-employee option gains and losses related to the fair market value change for fully vested options outstanding for consultants, which are accounted for as free-standing derivatives, and grant income were also included in other income and expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $146   and   $279, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of   September 30, 2016   the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of   $47,360   and outstanding debt   of $25,000  , resulting in a net cash position of   $22,360  . We had unused borrowing capacity   of $15,000 under   our revolving credit facility. Most of our cash is held by financial institutions in the United States of America. We had net working capital of   $57,920   and an accumulated deficit of   $190,349   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Cash flows used in operating activities.   Net cash used in operating activities for the   n  ine   m  onths   ended September 30, 2016   was   $15,880  . The primary net uses of cash for operating activities were as follows:  

a net decrease in cash used related to changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $7,295  , due primarily to the following:     

an increase in accounts receivable of $1,777, due primarily to increased revenues and the timing of collections;     

a  n     in  crease in inventory of   $1,234  ,    due primarily to increased inventory levels in support of anticipated revenue growth and the move to a new corporate headquarters building; and     

a    $4,228     de  crease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments, including variable compensation payments.     

Cash flows   used in   investing activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $18,892 for the nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The primary source of cash from investing activities was   $14,602   related to sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities. This source of cash was offset by   $6,102   related to the purchase of property and equipment, which included the placement of our RF and cryo generators with our customers  , and $27,395 related to the purchase of available-for-sale securities  . 

Cash flows provided by financing activities.   Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $27,041  , which was primarily due to   proceeds from borrowings of debt of $25,000,   proceeds from stock option exercises of   $2,595 our employee stock purchase plan of $987,   partially offset by shares repurchased for payment of taxes on stock awards of   $1,078     and   capital lease payments   of $343  . 

Credit facility.   The Company s Loan and Security Agreement with   Silicon Valley Bank (  SVB  )  , as amended, restated, and modified   effective April 25, 2016   (Loan Agreement) provides for a   $25,000 term loan and a   revolving credit facility under which we may borrow a maximum of $15,000.     The term loan has a five-year term, with principal payments   to be   made ratably   commencing   twelve months after the inception of the loan   through   to   the loan s   maturity   date  . If   we   meet certain conditions, as specified by the loan agreement,   the commencement of   term loan payments may be deferred by an additional six months.   As of September 30, 2016, the Company expects to meet the conditions necessary to defer the commencement of term loan payments.   The term loan accrues interest at the Prime Rate and is subject to an additional 4.0% fee on the   original $25,000   term loan   principal amount   at maturity   or prepayment of the term loan  .    Borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of $15,000 or a borrowing base calculation as defined by the Loan Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and we had borrowing availability   of $15,000.   The   applicable borrowing rate on   advances outstanding under   the revolving   credit   facility is the   P  rime   R  ate  .     The revolving line of credit is subject to an annual commitment fee of $50, and any borrowings bear interest at the Prime Rate.   The   Loan Agreement also provides for certain prepayment and early termination fees, as well as establishes covenants related to liquidity, sales growth and a minimum cash balance, and includes other customary terms and conditions. The term loan and revolving credit facility both mature     in April 2021  .

Table of Contents  

The Loan Agreement contains covenants that include, among others, covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets, enter into mergers or acquisitions, incur indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock, make investments or loans, and enter into certain affiliate transactions, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. Additional covenants apply when we have outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility or when we hold less than $20,000 in cash and investments with SVB. Financial covenants under the credit facility include minimum   trailing twelve month revenues   and a minimum liquidity ratio. Further, a minimum fixed charge ratio applies when specific covenant milestones are achieved. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate by 3.0%, an acceleration of all obligations under the Loan Agreement, an obligation to repay all obligations in full and a right by SVB to exercise all remedies available to it under the Loan Agreement and related agreements including the Guaranty and Security Agreement. Specified assets have been pledged as collateral.    

In connection with the terms of our Mason facility lease, a letter of credit in the amount of $1,250 was issued to the landlord of our Mason facility in October 2015 and remains outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 

Uses of liquidity and capital resources.   Our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products, future expenses to expand and support our sales and marketing efforts, costs relating to changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations and costs of filing, costs associated with clinical trials and securing regulatory approval for new products, costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses, costs associated with prosecuting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights and possible acquisitions and joint ventures. Global economic turmoil may adversely impact our revenue, access to the capital markets or future demand for our products.    

We have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement   which allows us to sell any combination of senior or subordinated debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares and units in one or more offerings should we choose to do so in the future.   We expect to maintain the effectiveness of this shelf registration statement for the foreseeable future. 

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with the cash we expect to generate or use for operations or access via our term loan and revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.   The   nContact   transaction provides for contingent consideration to be paid upon attaining specified regulatory approvals and clinical and revenue milestones over the next five years. Subject to the terms and conditions of the nContact merger agreement, such contingent consideration   is   paid in AtriCure common stock   and cash  . Over the next twelve months, we do not expect our cash requirements to include significant payments of contingent consideration based on terms of the acquisition agreement and related milestones. 

If our sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a revised or additional credit facility. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Finally, our term loan agreement and revolving line of credit require compliance with certain financial and other covenants. If we are unable to maintain these financing arrangements, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research and development, clinical activities and selling and marketing efforts. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016 we had operating lease agreements not recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating leases are utilized in the normal course of business. 

Seasonality 

During the third quarter, we typically experience a moderate decline in revenue that we attribute primarily to the elective nature of certain procedures in which our products are used. We believe this is due to fewer people choosing to undergo elective procedures during the summer months. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns and allowances, accounts receivable, inventories and share-based compensation. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our Annual Report on Form 10-

Ite    m 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As of September 30, 2016 there were no material changes to the information provided under Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Ite    m 4.  Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the Principal Executive Officer) and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Accounting and Financial Officer), supervised and participated in the evaluation. Based on the evaluation, we concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms and rules, and the material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the Principal Executive Officer) and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Accounting and Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that control objectives are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company will be detected. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override. Over time, controls can become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance may deteriorate. Further, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any cost-effective control system, misstatements due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In the ordinary course of business we routinely enhance our information systems by either upgrading current systems or implementing new ones. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Item 1A,   Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, all of which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.
