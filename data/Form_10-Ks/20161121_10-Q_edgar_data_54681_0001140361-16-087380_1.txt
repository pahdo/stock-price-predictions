 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation Policy and Basis of Presentation     The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Katy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries in which it has a greater than 50% voting interest or significant influence, collectively  Katy  or the  Company .  All significant intercompany accounts, profits and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016 and the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015  have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  and reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods.  Interim results may not be indicative of results to be realized for the entire year.  The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, together with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).

Fiscal Year     The Company operates and reports using a 4-4-5 fiscal year which always ends on December 31.  As a result, December and January do not typically consist of five and four weeks, respectively.  The three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 consisted of 63 shipping days each.  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 consisted of 192 and 186 shipping days, respectively.

Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Inventories      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 60% and 67%, respectively, of Katy s inventories were accounted for using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method of costing, while the remaining inventories were accounted for using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.  Current cost, as determined using the FIFO method, exceeded LIFO cost by $3.7 million at September 30, 2016 and $3.6 million at December 31, 2015. The components of inventories are as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (amounts in thousands): 

Fair Value Measurement and Financial Instruments       Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value, including the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.

7 

Index 

The following is a brief description of those three levels:

Level 1  : Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2  : Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.

Level 3  : Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions.

The Company determines the fair value of its pension assets annually primarily based on the fair value of underlying investments and market-based inputs (Level 2) and are evaluated by a third-party. The Company does not have any unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Share-Based Payment     Compensation cost recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 includes compensation cost for outstanding stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) as of September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 based on the September 30, 2016 and the September 25, 2015 fair values, respectively.  The Company re-measures the fair value of SARs each reporting period until the award is settled and compensation expense is recognized each reporting period for changes in fair value and vesting.

Compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The components of compensation expense are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively (amounts in thousands):

The fair value of SARs, a liability award, was estimated at September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The Company estimated the expected term by averaging the minimum and maximum lives expected for each award.  In addition, the Company estimated volatility by considering its historical stock volatility over a term comparable to the remaining expected life of each award.  The risk-free interest rate is the current yield available on U.S. treasury issues with a remaining term equal to each award.  The Company estimates forfeitures using historical results.  Its estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from their estimate.  The assumptions for expected term, volatility and risk-free rate are presented in the table below as of September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively:

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss     The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are foreign currency translation adjustments and pension and other postretirement benefits adjustments.  The balance of the foreign currency translation adjustments account was $ 1.0  at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The balance of the pension and other postretirement benefits adjustments account was $ 0.7  million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Segment Reporting     Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief decision maker or group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  The Company s chief decision maker reviews the results of operations and requests for capital expenditures based on one industry segment: manufacturing, importing, distributing commercial cleaning, storage, and structural foam products.  The Company s entire revenue is generated through this segment.

Reclassifications     The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ) during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. As shown in the table below, pursuant to the guidance in ASU 2015-03, we have reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our term loan (see Note 4 for detail) in our previously reported Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 to conform to our presentation as of September 30, 2016 as follows (amounts in thousands):

Note 2. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU  or  Update ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. On July 9, 2015 the FASB voted to defer the effective date of this standard by one year to December 15, 2017 for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. Companies may use either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating which transition approach to use and the full impact this ASU will have on our future financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330),  authoritative guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory. Under this new standard, an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this guidance should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not believe this will have any material impact on its financial statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which simplifies the reporting of deferred tax positions, requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as opposed to current and noncurrent classification under current GAAP. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe this will have any material impact on its financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its future financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  which addresses eight specific cash flow issues. Cash flow issues pertaining to the Company include clarification on classification of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its future financial statements.

 LOSS PER SHARE

The condensed consolidated financial statements include basic and diluted loss per share. Diluted per share information is calculated by considering the impact of potential common stock on the weighted average shares outstanding. Potential common stock consists of (a) incremental shares that would be available for issuance upon the assumed exercise of stock options  in the money  based on the average stock price for the respective period, (b) convertible preferred shares (see Note 8), accounted for using the  if converted  basis, which assumes their conversion to common stock at a ratio of 16.6:1, (c) convertible debt (see Note 4), accounted for using the  if converted  basis, which assumes its conversion to common stock at a conversion rate of $0.0697 per share, and (d) the Centrex earnout payment obligation (see Note 4) accounted for using the  if converted  basis, which assumes its conversion to common stock at a conversion rate based upon the relative value of the earnout payment obligation and the value of the convertible debt.

As of September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015, all options had expired. At September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015, 1,131,551 convertible preferred shares were outstanding, which are in total, convertible into 18,859,183 shares of the Company s common stock. Convertible debt was issued on August 11, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, $26.3 million of convertible debt (including outstanding principal and interest as of that date) was outstanding, which is in total, convertible into 377,109,583 shares of the Company s common stock. The Centrex earnout payment obligation, became convertible into the Company s common stock as part of the Fourth Amendment agreement on August 11, 2016 (see Note 4).  As of September 30, 2016, $2.0 million was owed, which is in total, convertible into 28,694,405 shares of the Company s common stock.

Shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred shares were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 25, 2015 because of their anti-dilutive impact as a result of the Company s net loss position.  Shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible debt and the Centrex earnout payment obligation were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of their anti-dilutive impact as a result of the Company s net loss position.

Long-term debt consists of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (amounts in thousands):

First Lien Credit Agreement 

On February 19, 2014, the Company and BMO Harris Bank N.A. ( BMO )  entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the  Original BMO Credit Agreement  or, as subsequently amended, the  BMO Credit Agreement ),  which  provided the Company a $27.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $3.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The proceeds of the Company s initial borrowing under the BMO Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company s prior credit facility, finance the acquisition of FTW Holdings, Inc., and pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of the Original BMO Credit Agreement. All extensions of credit under the BMO Credit Agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Company.

Index 

On April 7, 2015, the Company, Continental Commercial Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, 2155735 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation, CCP Canada Inc., an Ontario corporation, FTW Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Fort Wayne Plastics, Inc., an Indiana corporation, wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the foregoing, including the Company, the  Borrowers ), and BMO, as lender entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original BMO Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 1 ) to amend the Original BMO Credit Agreement and to obtain the consent of BMO for the acquisition of a manufacturing facility in Tiffin, Ohio.

Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, the revolving credit facility under the Original BMO Credit Agreement was increased from an amount not to exceed $27.0 million to an amount not to exceed $33.0 million.  The revolving credit facility under the BMO Credit Agreement continues to include a $3.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The proceeds advanced under the BMO Credit Agreement on April 7, 2015 were used to pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of Amendment No. 1 and the acquisition of our Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility (as described in Note 10). Subject to the terms of an  Intercreditor and Subordination Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2015 (the  Intercreditor Agreement ), between BMO and the SL Agent (as defined below), all extensions of credit under the BMO Credit Agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Borrowers.

The Original BMO Credit Agreement was further amended pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to extend the maturity date of the credit facility from February 17, 2017 to April 7, 2018.  The borrowing base continues to be determined by eligible inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment and owned real estate  amounting to $  20.4 million at September 30, 2016 and $27.3 million at December 31, 2015, respectively. The borrowing base under the BMO Credit Agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of standby and commercial letters of credit. Currently, the Company s largest letters of credit relate to its casualty insurance programs. Total outstanding letters of credit were $  1.6 million and $1.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement continue to bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Borrower s option, (a) the Base Rate plus applicable Base Rate Margin, which varies from 0.50% to 1.00% based on average excess availability, or (b) reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin, which varies from 1.50% to 2.00% based on average excess availability. The Base Rate is the greatest of (i) BMO Harris  prime commercial rate as in effect on such day, (ii) the sum of the Fed Funds rate for such day plus 0.5%, and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate for one month plus 1.50%. The Eurodollar Rate is the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate, as published by Reuters (or other commercially available source) with a term equivalent to the applicable one, two, three or nine month interest period. An unused commitment fee of 25 basis points per annum is payable quarterly on the average unused amount under the BMO Credit Agreement.

Amendment No. 1 amended the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the Original BMO Credit Agreement and added a maximum annual capital expenditures, minimum consolidated EBITDA, minimum availability and a leverage ratio covenant.  Amendment No. 1 also amended the Original BMO Credit Agreement to permit the secured second lien credit facility described below.

On December 15, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit and Security Agreement to amend the BMO Credit Agreement to redefine the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Company s former Bridgeton, Missouri facility.

On March 30, 2016,  the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit and Security Agreement and Waiver ( Amendment No. 3 ) to amend the BMO Credit Agreement to provide the Borrowers  with additional flexibility under certain financial covenants in future periods ending in 2016 and waive certain covenant defaults for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Further, Amendment No. 3 replaces the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for the test period for the fiscal quarters ending on or closest to March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 and provides for monthly testing of the minimum consolidated EBITDA and leverage ratio financial covenants for the monthly period ending on or closest to the last day of each month from March 2016 through September 2016 in lieu of quarterly testing during such period.

Amendment No. 3 provides that a termination fee shall be payable in the event that the revolving credit commitment under the BMO Credit Agreement is terminated prior to the revolving credit maturity date.  The termination fee is equal to 2% of the revolving credit commitment of $33.0 million if the revolving credit commitment is terminated on or before the first anniversary of Amendment No. 3 or 1% if the revolving credit commitment is thereafter terminated prior to the revolving credit maturity date under the BMO Credit Agreement.

Index 

The BMO Credit Agreement continues to require a lockbox agreement which provides receipts (subject to certain exceptions) to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. This provision in the BMO Credit Agreement causes the BMO Credit Agreement to be classified as a current liability, per guidance in the Accounting Standards Codification established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The BMO Credit Agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year, but rather has a final maturity date of April 7, 2018.

On August 11, 2016,   the Company   entered into Amendment No. 4 and Forbearance Agreement (the  Forbearance Agreement ), further amending   the BMO Credit Agreement.    Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, BMO agreed, among other things, to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the BMO Credit Agreement in respect of existing defaults and certain other anticipated defaults for a period of up to nine months (the  forbearance period ).  BMO may terminate the forbearance period (i) if  VPC SBIC I, LP (the  VPC SBIC Fund ) or its affiliates  assign or grant a participation in any portion of the term notes or Second Lien Credit Facility (as discussed below), (ii) upon a bankruptcy filing or commencement of another insolvency proceeding by or against any Borrower or guarantor or (iii) the occurrence of any additional event of default under the BMO Credit Agreement.    Borrowings from BMO under the   Forbearance Agreement   bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 6.5%. 

As part of the  Forbearance Agreement,  the Company has retained a chief restructuring officer (the  CRO ) for the duration of the forbearance period. The Company has authorized the CRO to meet with BMO and its advisors and provide to BMO such information and reports with respect to the Company and its financial condition, businesses, assets, liabilities and prospects, as BMO may request from time to time.  

At all times during the forbearance period, the Company is required to diligently pursue in good faith the consummation of the refinancing of the obligations to BMO under the BMO Credit Agreement in their entirety by February 5, 2017.  The Company agreed to pay BMO the following fees in the event that all borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement have not been paid in full on or before the following dates.

Under the  Forbearance Agreement, t he Centrex earnout payments (see Note 10) may not be satisfied until the obligations to BMO under the BMO Credit Agreement are paid in full. In addition, the Company may not make any cash payments in respect of indebtedness under the Second Lien Credit Facility or any other subordinated indebtedness consisting of principal or interest, until all borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement have been paid in full.

On November 16, 2016, all outstanding borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement were repaid with proceeds of the Encina Credit Agreement (as described in Note 13) and the BMO Credit Agreement was terminated.

Second Lien Credit Facility 

On April 7, 2015, the Company, Continental Commercial Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, FTW Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Fort Wayne Plastics, Inc., an Indiana corporation, as borrowers (the  SL Borrowers ) and 2155735 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation, and CCP Canada Inc., an Ontario corporation, as guarantors (the  Guarantors,  together with the SL Borrowers, the  SL Obligors ) entered into a Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2015, among the SL Obligors, Victory Park Management, LLC, as Agent (the  SL Agent  or  Victory Park Management ), and the lenders party thereto (the  Second Lien Credit Agreement ).

The Second Lien Credit Agreement provides the SL Borrowers with a $24.0 million term loan.  The proceeds of the term loan were used to pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of the credit facility and the acquisition of our Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility (see Note 10). Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all extensions of credit under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are collateralized by a second priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the SL Obligors.

Index 

The term loan under the Second Lien Credit Agreement originally bore interest (i) at a cash interest rate of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate then in effect plus 9.5% per annum and (ii) a Payment in Kind ( PIK ) interest rate equal to 4.00% per annum. The PIK interest is added to long-term debt per the Second Lien Credit Agreement as it is not due until maturity.  The interest rate was modified pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement, as described below.      The maturity date of the credit facility under the Second Lien Credit Agreement is April 6, 2019. 

Pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Agreement, the SL Borrowers are required to make quarterly amortization payments and annual excess cash flow prepayments equal to 25% of annual excess cash flow as defined in the agreement.  The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum annual capital expenditures, a minimum consolidated EBITDA, a minimum availability under the BMO Credit Agreement and a leverage ratio.

On December 15, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second Lien Credit Agreement to amend the Second Lien Credit Agreement to redefine the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Company s former Bridgeton, Missouri facility.

On March 30, 2016,  the SL Obligors entered into a Limited Waiver and Amendment to the Second Lien Credit Agreement (the  Second Lien Amendment No. 2 ) to further amend the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Amendment No. 2  provides the SL Borrowers with additional flexibility under certain financial covenants in future periods ending in 2016 and waives certain covenant defaults for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Further, the Second Lien Amendment No. 2 replaces the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for the test period for the fiscal quarters ending on or closest to March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 and provides for monthly testing of the minimum consolidated EBITDA and leverage ratio financial covenants for the monthly period ending on or closest to the last day of each month from March 2016 through September 2016 in lieu of quarterly testing during such period.

On July 22 , 2016,   the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Lien Credit Agreement   (the  Third Amendment ), pursuant to which the   SL Agent   extended an additional $750,000 term loan to the Company. The Third Amendment did not materially modify the terms of the Second Lien Credit Agreement. 

On August 11, 2016, Victory Park Capital Advisors, LLC ( Victory Park Capital Advisors ) on behalf of entities for which it acts as investment manager, agreed to provide the Company with new senior secured second lien financing in the amount of $5,750,000 (the  New Second Lien Financing ).  In connection with the New Second Lien Financing the Company, the SL Borrowers, Victory Park Management, as agent, and the lenders party thereto, entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement (the  Fourth Amendment ), to further amend the Second Lien Credit Agreement (as previously amended, the  Prior Second Lien Credit Agreement  and as amended by the Fourth Amendment, the  Second Lien Credit Facility ).

Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the lenders agreed to a further extension of credit in the amount of $5,750,000. The Fourth Amendment also provides Victory Park Management the option to convert, in whole or in part, the outstanding principal amount of, and accrued but unpaid interest on, the then-existing term loans (the  Term Loans ) made pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility (not including the new term loans made pursuant to the Third Amendment and Fourth Amendment) into a number of shares of common stock equal to the amount of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under the Term Loans being converted, divided by approximately $0.0697 (as such amount is proportionately adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends and other distributions and recapitalizations affecting the capital stock of the Company).  As of August 11, 2016, the Term Loans would have been convertible into up to 370,748,441 shares of common stock.  The funds for the extension of credit contemplated by the Fourth Amendment were provided by the lenders party to the Second Lien Credit Agreement, including the VPC SBIC Fund.  Any shares issued upon conversion of the Term Loans are required to be issued to the lenders party to the Second Lien Credit Facility pro rata in accordance with their respective commitments under the Term Loans.

The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Term Loans exceeds the number of unissued and unreserved shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue, and the conversion price per share is less than the current par value per share of the common stock.  The SPA provides that, upon request of the VPC SBIC Fund, the Company will take all corporate action necessary, and use reasonable best efforts, (i) to increase the number of shares that the Company is authorized to issue and to reserve a sufficient number of shares to allow Victory Park Management to exercise its conversion rights under the Second Lien Credit Facility in full; and (ii) to decrease the par value per share of common stock to nothing or to a par value equal to, or less than, the per share conversion price under the Second Lien Credit Facility.

Index 

Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, all borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to 12.00% per annum, payable in kind ( PIK ). The PIK interest is added to long-term debt per the Second Lien Credit Agreement as it is not due until maturity.  The maturity  date  of the Term Loans remains April 6, 2019. The maturity date of the new term loans made pursuant to the Third Amendment and the Fourth Amendment is August 11, 2017; however, the term will be automatically extended by one year as of August 11, 2017, unless notice of cancellation is provided by Victory Park Management prior to such date. 

In connection with the Fourth Amendment, Centrex, TR Plastics and Terrence L. Reinhart (the  Seller ) agreed that any earnout payment in connection with the acquisition described in Note 10 would be subordinated to payment in full of borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement and  the  Second Lien Credit Facility.  In addition, the Seller agreed that, to the extent that Victory Park Management exercises its right to convert all of the Term Loans into common stock, the value of the earnout payment would be calculated as of the date of such conversion and would be satisfied in full by payment in shares of common stock based upon the relative value of the earnout payment and the value of the Term Loans being converted (see Note 10).  The Company recorded a deferred obligation equal to the present value of the earnout payments of $2.0 million, which was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016.

On November 16, 2016, the Second Lien Credit Facility was further amended as described in Note 13.

 RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

Certain subsidiaries have frozen pension plans covering substantially all of their employees.  These plans are noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans.  The benefits to be paid under these plans are generally based on employees  retirement age and years of service.  The Company s funding policies, subject to the minimum funding requirements of employee benefit and tax laws and as determined on an actuarial basis, provide the plans with assets sufficient to meet the benefit obligations.  Plan assets consist primarily of fixed income investments, corporate equities and government securities.  The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for some of its retired employees.  The postretirement health plans are unfunded.

Information regarding the Company s net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 25, 2015 is as follows (amounts in thousands):

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made contributions of $46,000 to the pension plans. The Company expects to contribute an additional $15,000 to pension plans throughout the remainder of 2016.  The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The fair value of plan assets was determined by inputs to the valuation which include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs). The Company utilized a third-party to evaluate the fair value of the plan assets and reviews all applicable inputs and calculations for purposes of valuing the plan s assets.

Note 6. 
 
 STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company has various stock incentive plans that provide for the granting of stock options, nonqualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock, performance units or shares and other incentive awards to certain employees and directors.   SARs entitle the holder to receive cash, upon vesting, equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on the date of exercise over the fair market value of such share on the date granted. SARs have been granted at or above the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant, typically vest over periods up to three years, and expire ten years from the date of issue.  No more than 50% of the cumulative number of vested SARs held by an employee can be exercised in any one calendar year.

As of September 30, 2016 there were  39,000  outstanding SARs. No SARS were issued for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 6,000 SARs were issued. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate liability related to SARs was $ 21,000  and $ 32,000 , respectively, and is included in accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 7. 
 
 INCOME TAXES

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company and its subsidiaries are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 83.2  million subject to a valuation allowance of $ 83.4  million.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 80.1  million subject to a valuation allowance of $ 80.2  million.   Domestic net operating loss ( NOL ) carry forwards comprised $ 67.5  million and $ 64.4  million of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Katy s history of operating losses in many of its taxing jurisdictions provides significant negative evidence with respect to the Company s ability to generate future taxable income.  The valuation allowance relates to federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards, foreign and domestic tax credits, and certain other deferred tax assets to the extent they exceed deferred tax liabilities.

 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

For each of the three and nine months ended September 25, 2015,   Kohlberg   Company, L.L.C. (the  Kohlberg Manager ), whose affiliate held all 1,131,551 shares of the Company s convertible preferred stock and provided management oversight and advisory services to the Company until August 11, 2016.  On August 11, 2016, the  Kohlberg Manager s ongoing  management oversight and advisory services were terminated upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the SPA (as defined in Note 12), and all amounts owed to the  Kohlberg Manager (other than limited indemnification rights) were  waived in connection with the mutual release described in Note 12.

At December 31, 2015, the Company owed the Kohlberg Manager $ 3.8  million for management oversight and advisory services, which is recorded in noncurrent liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to the termination of the Kohlberg Manager s management oversight and advisory services on August 11, 2016, the Company incurred an annual expense of $0.5 million in respect of these services. On August 11, 2016, the Kohlberg Manager agreed to waive payment of these management fees (which totaled $4.0 million) as part of the mutual release agreement (see Note 12).  The Company capitalized the waiver of the related party payable of $4.0 million, which is recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016.

The notes accrue interest at a rate of 15% per year, which will be paid by capitalizing such interest and adding such capitalized interest to the principal amount of the subordinated notes.

As part of the August 11, 2016 mutual release agreement, the Kohlberg Manager agreed to release the Company from repaying the promissory notes due to the Kohlberg Manager.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General Environmental Claims

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions are involved in remedial activities at certain present and former locations and have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ( PRPs ) at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( Superfund ) or equivalent state laws and, as such, may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites.  Responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.  Under the federal Superfund statute, parties could be held jointly and severally liable, thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site.  Based on its estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs, the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent, public companies, will fully pay the costs apportioned to them, currently available information concerning the scope of contamination, estimated remediation costs, estimated legal fees and other factors, the Company has recorded and accrued for environmental liabilities in amounts that it deems reasonable and believes that any liability with respect to these matters in excess of the accruals will not be material.  The ultimate costs will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate on an undiscounted basis of the total costs to be incurred.  The Company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next five to ten years.

Other Claims

There are a number of product liability, asbestos and workers  compensation claims pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.  Many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated.  The Company estimates that it can take up to ten years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome on certain claims.  With respect to the product liability, asbestos and workers  compensation claims, the Company has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage, including those incurred but not reported to the Company or its insurance providers, which are developed using actuarial techniques. Such accruals are developed using currently available claim information, and represent management s best estimates, including estimated legal fees, on an undiscounted basis.  The ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon, among other factors, the nature of the injury, the duration of the disability period, the length of the claim period, the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome.

Although management believes that the actions specified above in this section individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have outcomes that will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flow, further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when, and if, current information dictates a change in management s estimates.

 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

On April 7, 2015, Continental Commercial Products ( CCP ), a Delaware limited liability company, and a wholly owned subsidiary the Company, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the  assets and business operations related to the plastics shelving and cabinet business of Centrex Plastics, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company ( Centrex ) and T.R. Plastics, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company ( TR Plastics ) for $23.9 million in cash at closing, plus certain post-closing earnout payments of not less than $2.0 million over three years, as described in the Asset Purchase Agreement dated April 7, 2015 (the  Purchase Agreement ) by and between CCP, Centrex, TR Plastics, and Terrence L. Reinhart, the majority member of Centrex and the sole member of TR Plastics.   On August 11, 2016, additional terms regarding the earnout payments were agreed upon in  the Fourth Amendment to the Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement (see Note 4).   The acquisition of the Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility brings a breadth of shelving and storage cabinet solutions to the Katy consumer storage product line   which we believe are highly complementary to our current products. 

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 25, 2015 do not include any revenues or expenses related to the acquisition prior to the closing date. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is presented as if the Tiffin, Ohio acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. In addition, this unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as necessarily being indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if the acquisition had actually occurred during those periods, or the results that may be obtained in the future as a result of the acquisition.

 STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

On August 11, 2016, the Company, KKTY Holding Company, L.L.C. ( KKTY Holding ), the Kohlberg Manager, certain funds affiliated with the Kohlberg Manager (the  Kohlberg Funds  and, together with the Kohlberg Manager,  Kohlberg ) and the VPC SBIC Fund entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  SPA ) whereby KKTY Holding sold all of its 1,131,551 shares of convertible preferred stock of the Company (the  Preferred Stock ), to the VPC SBIC Fund, in exchange for nominal cash consideration and the execution of a mutual release (the  Acquisition ).  The Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 18,859,183 shares of the Company s common stock, which, if converted in full, would  represent  70.3% of our outstanding common stock (after giving effect to such conversion).  The closing of the Acquisition (the  Closing ) took place concurrently with the execution of the SPA.

Pursuant to the mutual release, and as a condition to Victory Park Capital Advisors  willingness to provide the New Second Lien Financing (as discussed in Note 4), Kohlberg agreed to release the Company, Victory Park Capital Advisors, the VPC SBIC Fund and Victory Park Management from potential claims, other than potential claims for indemnification under the management agreement, dated June 28, 2001, between the Company and the Kohlberg Manager (the  Management Agreement ).  In accordance with the SPA, such Management Agreement, together with any other similar advisory agreements between any of KKTY Holding, the Kohlberg Manager, the Kohlberg Funds and the Company, were terminated as of August 11, 2016.  In addition, Victory Park Capital Advisors, Victory Park Management and the VPC SBIC Fund, on behalf of themselves and certain of their affiliates, agreed to release Kohlberg and the current and former officers and directors of the Company from claims and potential claims, other than those arising under the SPA.  In accordance with the SPA, the Company also provided a general release in favor of Kohlberg, certain of its affiliates and members of the Board appointed by Kohlberg.

In connection with the Closing, and pursuant to the SPA, Charles Asfour, a partner of Victory Park Capital Advisors, the VPC SBIC Fund s investment manager, was appointed as a director of the Company and all of the then-serving directors of the Company, other than its Chief Executive Officer, resigned as of the Closing.   On August 30, 2016, Mr. Asfour was appointed as Chairman of the Board.   Two additional directors designated by the VPC SBIC Fund were appointed to the Company s board of directors (the  Board ) effective as of September 12, 2016.   The Company has also agreed, in connection with any annual or special meeting of its stockholders at which directors are to be elected, to take all reasonably necessary action within its control and use its reasonable best efforts to cause an individual designated by  the VPC SBIC Fund  to be nominated for election (or re-election, as the case may be) to the Board, to recommend that such individual be elected to the Board, and to solicit proxies on behalf of such director nominee.

 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On November 16, 2016, the Company, Continental Commercial Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, 2155735 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation, CCP Canada Inc., an Ontario corporation, FTW Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Fort Wayne Plastics, Inc., an Indiana corporation, wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the foregoing, including the Company, the  Borrowers ) entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with Encina Business Credit SPV, LLC, as agent and swing line lender, and the lenders party thereto (the  Encina Credit Agreement ).  The Encina Credit Agreement provides the Borrowers with a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, including a $2.5 million sub-limit for letters of credit and a $2.5 million sub-limit for swing line loans, a term loan in the principal amount of $3.5 million ( Term Loan A ) and a term loan in the principal amount of $3.1 million ( Term Loan B ).

The proceeds of the initial borrowings under the Encina Credit Agreement, which totaled $19.9 million (including Term Loan A and Term Loan B), were used to repay all the outstanding borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement (which was then terminated) and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of the Encina Credit Agreement and the termination of the BMO Credit Agreement.  All extensions of credit under the Encina Credit Agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Borrowers.

Borrowings under the revolving portion of the Encina Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 5.25% per annum plus the greater of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate and 0.5%.  Term Loan A bears interest at a rate equal to 5.75% per annum plus the greater of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate and 0.5%, and Term Loan B bears interest at a rate equal to 6% per annum plus the greater of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate and 0.5%.  The maturity date of the borrowings under the Encina Credit Agreement is November 16, 2019.  The Borrowers are required to make monthly amortization payments in respect of Term Loan A and Term Loan B commencing in November 2017.

The Encina Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and restrictions, including, among other things, restrictions on the ability of the Borrowers to create or permit liens on assets, make certain investments and make certain acquisitions or dispositions.  Under the Encina Credit Agreement, the Centrex earnout payments (see Note 10) may not be satisfied until all obligations under the Encina Credit Agreement are paid in full, except that the Centrex earnout payments may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock as described in Note 4. In addition, payments in respect of indebtedness under the Second Lien Credit Facility are restricted pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement with the SL Agent, except for certain payments out of excess cash flow as described more fully below.

Upon termination of the BMO Credit Agreement, an early termination fee of $0.3 million was paid by the Company and an additional termination fee of $0.4 million is payable by the Company in equal installments over 12 months following the termination date.

In connection with the Encina Credit Agreement, the SL Obligors, Victory Park Management (as SL Agent) and the VPC SBIC Fund (as lender) entered into the Fifth Amendment to Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement and Limited Waiver (the  Fifth Amendment ) on November 16, 2016 to further amend the Second Lien Credit Facility.  The Fifth Amendment was primarily designed to conform certain representations, warranties and covenants in the Second Lien Credit Facility to the Encina Credit Agreement and further to (i) extend the maturity date of the obligations under the Second Lien Credit Facility to the date that is three months after the maturity of the obligations to the lenders under the Encina Credit Agreement, (ii) provide for the SL Borrowers to pay the lender under the Second Lien Credit Facility, if permitted under the intercreditor agreement with the SL Agent, up to 75% of excess cash flow so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is continuing under the Encina Credit Agreement and certain other financial conditions are satisfied, and (iii) suspend compliance with all existing financial covenants in the Second Lien Credit Facility (except for the limit on annual consolidated capital expenditures of $4.0 million) until the earlier of maturity or payment in full of the obligations under the Encina Credit Agreement.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This report and the information incorporated by reference in this report contain various  forward-looking statements  as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Versus Three Months Ended September 25, 2015 

Net sales  decreased   22.8%  from $ 31.0  million during the three months ended September 25, 2015 to $ 24.0  million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The  decrease in net sales was primarily  the result of manufacturing inefficiencies at our Jefferson City, Missouri facility as the result of the relocation from our Bridgeton, Missouri facility, and manufacturing inefficiencies at our Tiffin, Ohio facility. The manufacturing inefficiencies resulted in an increase in a backlog of orders totaling $1.8 million  during the current year period compared to the prior year period . Gross margin was  2.7%  for the three months ended September 30, 2016,  a decrease  of  1,260  basis points from the same period a year ago. The  decrease  was primarily a result of operational and freight inefficiencies at our Jefferson City, Missouri and Tiffin, Ohio facilities and unfavorable product mix.   The Company expects to realize favorable mix from its order backlog.   As a result of the decrease in sales and a decrease in gross margin, our gross profit decreased $4.1 million from $4.8 million to $0.7 million. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased  $ 1.0  million to $ 4.5  million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $ 3.5  million for the same period a year ago. The  increase  was primarily due to an increase in consulting services, insurance, and other fees related to the transactions surrounding the purchase of shares of our convertible preferred stock by VPC SBIC I, LP (the  VPC SBIC Fund ) and the related debt issuance in the current year period.

Severance, restructuring and related charges were $ 1.8  million for the three months ended September 25, 2015 due to the relocation of our Bridgeton, Missouri facility to Jefferson City, Missouri.

Operating loss  was  $ 3.8  million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an operating loss of $ 0.5  million during the three months ended September 25, 2015. The  decrease  was primarily due to decreased gross profit and increased selling, general and administrative expenses during the current year period compared to the prior year period, each as described above.

Interest expense  increased  by $ 0.4  million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 25, 2015 due to increased borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement and additional interest under the BMO Credit Agreement.

Overall, we reported a net loss of $5.4 million, or $0.68 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 25, 2015.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Versus Nine Months Ended September 25, 2015 

Net sales decreased 1.4% from $83.7 million during the nine months ended September 25, 2015 to $82.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease was primarily the result of an inability to meet orders due to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the relocation of our Bridgeton, Missouri facility to Jefferson City, Missouri, partially offset by the Tiffin, Ohio business acquisition, which contributed $18.5 million in net sales  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus net sales of $11.7 million for the nine months ended September 25, 2015 . Gross margin was 10.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 520 basis points from the same period a year ago. The  decrease  was primarily a result of operational and freight inefficiencies associated with the relocation of our Bridgeton, Missouri facility to Jefferson City, Missouri.  The decreased in sales and decrease in gross margin resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $4.5 million from $13.2 million to $8.7 million. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $ 1.2  million to $ 12.3  million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $ 11.1  million for the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the derecognition of a deferred lease obligation no longer owed as a result of our termination of the lease for our Bridgeton, Missouri facility during the nine months ended September 25, 2015. The increase was also attributed to an increase in consulting services, insurance, and other fees related to the transactions surrounding the purchase of shares of our convertible preferred stock by the VPC SBIC Fund and the related debt issuance in the current year period. The increase was partially offset by one-time acquisition costs related to the Tiffin, Ohio in the prior year.

Index 

Severance, restructuring and related charges decreased $ 3.1  million to $ 0.8  million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $ 3.9  million for the nine months ended September 25, 2015. These charges for both periods resulted from the relocation of our Bridgeton, Missouri facility to Jefferson City, Missouri.

Operating loss was $ 4.4  million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an operating loss of $ 1.9  million during the nine months ended September 25, 2015. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to decreased gross profit and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by to the decrease in severance, restructuring and related charges in the current year period compared to the prior year period, each as described above.

Interest expense  increased  by $ 1.7  million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 25, 2015, primarily as a result of the increased borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement (see Note 4) which was entered into in the second quarter of 2015.

Overall, we reported a net loss of $8.7 million, or $1.09 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $4.4 million, or $0.56 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 25, 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We require funding for working capital needs and capital expenditures.  As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $0.3 million and outstanding checks of $0.4 million as compared to cash of $0.1 million and outstanding checks of $0.9 million at December 31, 2015.   Our unused borrowing availability at September 30, 2016 under the BMO Credit Agreement was $0.1 million.  As of December 31, 2015, we had unused borrowing availability of $ 2.2  million. 

First Lien Credit Agreement 

On February 19, 2014, the Company and BMO Harris Bank N.A. ( BMO )  entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the  Original BMO Credit Agreement or, as subsequently amended, the  BMO Credit Agreement ),  which  provided the Company a $27.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $3.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The proceeds of the Company s initial borrowing under the BMO Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company s prior credit facility, finance the acquisition of FTW Holdings, Inc., and pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of the Original BMO Credit Agreement. All extensions of credit under the BMO Credit Agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Company. 

On April 7, 2015, the Company, Continental Commercial Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, 2155735 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation, CCP Canada Inc., an Ontario corporation, FTW Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Fort Wayne Plastics, Inc., an Indiana corporation, wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the foregoing, including the Company, the  Borrowers ), and BMO, as lender entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original BMO Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 1 ) to amend the Original BMO Credit Agreement and to obtain the consent of BMO for the acquisition of a manufacturing facility in Tiffin, Ohio.

Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, the revolving credit facility under the Original BMO Credit Agreement was increased from an amount not to exceed $27.0 million to an amount not to exceed $33.0 million.  The revolving credit facility under the BMO Credit Agreement continues to include a $3.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The proceeds advanced under the BMO Credit Agreement on April 7, 2015 were used to pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of Amendment No. 1 and the acquisition of our Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility (as described in Note 10). Subject to the terms of an  Intercreditor and Subordination Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2015 (the  Intercreditor Agreement ), between BMO and the SL Agent (as defined below), all extensions of credit under the BMO Credit Agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Borrowers.

The Original BMO Credit Agreement was further amended pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to extend the maturity date of the credit facility from February 17, 2017 to April 7, 2018.  The borrowing base continues to be determined by eligible inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment and owned real estate  amounting to $20.4 million at September 30, 2016 and $27.3 million at December 31, 2015, respectively. The borrowing base under the BMO Credit Agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of standby and commercial letters of credit. Currently, the Company s largest letters of credit relate to its casualty insurance programs. Total outstanding letters of credit were $1.6 million and $1.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Index 

Borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement continue to bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Borrower s option, (a) the Base Rate plus applicable Base Rate Margin, which varies from 0.50% to 1.00% based on average excess availability, or (b) reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin, which varies from 1.50% to 2.00% based on average excess availability. The Base Rate is the greatest of (i) BMO Harris  prime commercial rate as in effect on such day, (ii) the sum of the Fed Funds rate for such day plus 0.5%, and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate for one month plus 1.50%. The Eurodollar Rate is the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate, as published by Reuters (or other commercially available source) with a term equivalent to the applicable one, two, three or nine month interest period. An unused commitment fee of 25 basis points per annum is payable quarterly on the average unused amount under the BMO Credit Agreement.

Amendment No. 1 amended the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the Original BMO Credit Agreement and added a maximum annual capital expenditures, minimum consolidated EBITDA, minimum availability and a leverage ratio covenant.  Amendment No. 1 also amended the Original BMO Credit Agreement to permit the secured second lien credit facility described below.

On December 15, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit and Security Agreement to amend the BMO Credit Agreement to redefine the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Company s former Bridgeton, Missouri facility.

On March 30, 2016,  the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit and Security Agreement and Waiver ( Amendment No. 3 ) to amend the BMO Credit Agreement to provide the Borrowers  with additional flexibility under certain financial covenants in future periods ending in 2016 and waive certain covenant defaults for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Further, Amendment No. 3 replaces the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for the test period for the fiscal quarters ending on or closest to March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 and provides for monthly testing of the minimum consolidated EBITDA and leverage ratio financial covenants for the monthly period ending on or closest to the last day of each month from March 2016 through September 2016 in lieu of quarterly testing during such period.

Amendment No. 3 provides that a termination fee shall be payable in the event that the revolving credit commitment under the BMO Credit Agreement is terminated prior to the revolving credit maturity date.  The termination fee is equal to 2% of the revolving credit commitment of $33.0 million if the revolving credit commitment is terminated on or before the first anniversary of Amendment No. 3 or 1% if the revolving credit commitment is thereafter terminated prior to the revolving credit maturity date under the BMO Credit Agreement.

The BMO Credit Agreement continues to require a lockbox agreement which provides receipts (subject to certain exceptions) to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. This provision in the BMO Credit Agreement causes the BMO Credit Agreement to be classified as a current liability, per guidance in the Accounting Standards Codification established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The BMO Credit Agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year, but rather has a final maturity date of April 7, 2018.

On August 11, 2016,   the Company   entered into Amendment No. 4 and Forbearance Agreement (the  Forbearance Agreement ), further amending   the BMO Credit Agreement.    Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, BMO agreed, among other things, to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the BMO Credit Agreement in respect of existing defaults and certain other anticipated defaults for a period of up to nine months (the  forbearance period ).  BMO may terminate the forbearance period (i) if  VPC SBIC I, LP (the  VPC SBIC Fund ) or its affiliates  assign or grant a participation in any portion of the term notes or Second Lien Credit Facility (as discussed below), (ii) upon a bankruptcy filing or commencement of another insolvency proceeding by or against any Borrower or guarantor or (iii) the occurrence of any additional event of default under the BMO Credit Agreement.    Borrowings from BMO under the   Forbearance Agreement   bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 6.5%. 

As part of the  Forbearance Agreement,  the Company has retained a chief restructuring officer (the  CRO ) for the duration of the forbearance period. The Company has authorized the CRO to meet with BMO and its advisors and provide to BMO such information and reports with respect to the Company and its financial condition, businesses, assets, liabilities and prospects, as BMO may request from time to time.  

At all times during the forbearance period, the Company is required to diligently pursue in good faith the consummation of the refinancing of the obligations to BMO under the BMO Credit Agreement in their entirety by February 5, 2017.  The Company agreed to pay BMO the following fees in the event that all borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement have not been paid in full on or before the following dates.

Index 

Under the  Forbearance Agreement, t he Centrex earnout payments (see Note 10) may not be satisfied until the obligations to BMO under the BMO Credit Agreement are paid in full. In addition, the Company may not make any cash payments in respect of indebtedness under the Second Lien Credit Facility or any other subordinated indebtedness consisting of principal or interest, until all borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement have been paid in full.

On November 16, 2016, all outstanding borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement were repaid with proceeds of the Encina Credit Agreement (as described in Note 13) and the BMO Credit Agreement was terminated.

Second Lien Credit Facility 

On April 7, 2015, the Company, Continental Commercial Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, FTW Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Fort Wayne Plastics, Inc., an Indiana corporation, as borrowers (the  SL Borrowers ) and 2155735 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation, and CCP Canada Inc., an Ontario corporation, as guarantors (the  Guarantors,  together with the SL Borrowers, the  SL Obligors ) entered into a Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2015, among the SL Obligors, Victory Park Management, LLC, as Agent (the  SL Agent  or  Victory Park Management ), and the lenders party thereto (the  Second Lien Credit Agreement ).

The Second Lien Credit Agreement provides the SL Borrowers with a $24.0 million term loan.  The proceeds of the term loan were used to pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of the credit facility and the acquisition of our Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility (see Note 10). Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all extensions of credit under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are collateralized by a second priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the SL Obligors.

The term loan under the Second Lien Credit Agreement originally bore interest (i) at a cash interest rate of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate then in effect plus 9.5% per annum and (ii) a Payment in Kind ( PIK ) interest rate equal to 4.00% per annum. The PIK interest is added to long-term debt per the Second Lien Credit Agreement as it is not due until maturity.  The interest rate was modified pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement, as described below.      The maturity date of the credit facility under the Second Lien Credit Agreement is April 6, 2019. 

Pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Agreement, the SL Borrowers are required to make quarterly amortization payments and annual excess cash flow prepayments equal to 25% of annual excess cash flow as defined in the agreement.  The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum annual capital expenditures, a minimum consolidated EBITDA, a minimum availability under the BMO Credit Agreement and a leverage ratio.

On December 15, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second Lien Credit Agreement to amend the Second Lien Credit Agreement to redefine the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Company s former Bridgeton, Missouri facility.

On March 30, 2016,  the SL Obligors entered into a Limited Waiver and Amendment to the Second Lien Credit Agreement (the  Second Lien Amendment No. 2 ) to further amend the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Amendment No. 2  provides the SL Borrowers with additional flexibility under certain financial covenants in future periods ending in 2016 and waives certain covenant defaults for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Further, the Second Lien Amendment No. 2 replaces the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for the test period for the fiscal quarters ending on or closest to March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 and provides for monthly testing of the minimum consolidated EBITDA and leverage ratio financial covenants for the monthly period ending on or closest to the last day of each month from March 2016 through September 2016 in lieu of quarterly testing during such period.

Index 

On July 22 , 2016,   the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Lien Credit Agreement   (the  Third Amendment ), pursuant to which the   SL Agent   extended an additional $750,000 term loan to the Company. The Third Amendment did not materially modify the terms of the Second Lien Credit Agreement. 

On August 11, 2016, Victory Park Capital Advisors, LLC ( Victory Park Capital Advisors ) on behalf of entities for which it acts as investment manager, agreed to provide the Company with new senior secured second lien financing in the amount of $5,750,000 (the  New Second Lien Financing ).  In connection with the New Second Lien Financing the Company, the SL Borrowers, Victory Park Management, as agent, and the lenders party thereto, entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement (the  Fourth Amendment ), to further amend the Second Lien Credit Agreement (as previously amended, the  Prior Second Lien Credit Agreement  and as amended by the Fourth Amendment, the  Second Lien Credit Facility ).

Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the lenders agreed to a further extension of credit in the amount of $5,750,000. The Fourth Amendment also provides Victory Park Management the option to convert, in whole or in part, the outstanding principal amount of, and accrued but unpaid interest on, the then-existing term loans (the  Term Loans ) made pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility (not including the new term loans made pursuant to the Third Amendment and Fourth Amendment) into a number of shares of common stock equal to the amount of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under the Term Loans being converted, divided by approximately $0.0697 (as such amount is proportionately adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends and other distributions and recapitalizations affecting the capital stock of the Company).  As of August 11, 2016, the Term Loans would have been convertible into up to 370,748,441 shares of common stock.  The funds for the extension of credit contemplated by the Fourth Amendment were provided by the lenders party to the Second Lien Credit Agreement, including the VPC SBIC Fund.  Any shares issued upon conversion of the Term Loans are required to be issued to the lenders party to the Second Lien Credit Facility pro rata in accordance with their respective commitments under the Term Loans.

The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Term Loans exceeds the number of unissued and unreserved shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue, and the conversion price per share is less than the current par value per share of the common stock.  The SPA provides that, upon request of the VPC SBIC Fund, the Company will take all corporate action necessary, and use reasonable best efforts, (i) to increase the number of shares that the Company is authorized to issue and to reserve a sufficient number of shares to allow Victory Park Management to exercise its conversion rights under the Second Lien Credit Facility in full; and (ii) to decrease the par value per share of common stock to nothing or to a par value equal to, or less than, the per share conversion price under the Second Lien Credit Facility.

Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, all borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to 12.00% per annum, payable in kind ( PIK ). The PIK interest is added to long-term debt per the Second Lien Credit Agreement as it is not due until maturity.  The maturity  date  of the Term Loans remains April 6, 2019. The maturity date of the new term loans made pursuant to the Third Amendment and the Fourth Amendment is August 11, 2017; however, the term will be automatically extended by one year as of August 11, 2017, unless notice of cancellation is provided by Victory Park Management prior to such date. 

In connection with the Fourth Amendment, Centrex, TR Plastics and Terrence L. Reinhart (the  Seller ) agreed that any earnout payment in connection with the acquisition described in Note 10 would be subordinated to payment in full of borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement and  the  Second Lien Credit Facility.  In addition, the Seller agreed that, to the extent that Victory Park Management exercises its right to convert all of the Term Loans into common stock, the value of the earnout payment would be calculated as of the date of such conversion and would be satisfied in full by payment in shares of common stock based upon the relative value of the earnout payment and the value of the Term Loans being converted (see Note 10).  The Company recorded a deferred obligation equal to the present value of the earnout payments of $2.0 million, which was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016.

On November 16, 2016, the Second Lien Credit Facility was further amended as described in Note 13.

Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had amortization of debt issuance costs, included within interest expense, of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

Cash used in investing activities of $2.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily due to capital expenditures related to the relocation of the Bridgeton, Missouri facility to Jefferson City, Missouri. Cash used in investing activities of $26.0 million in the nine months ended September 25, 2015 were primarily due to the purchase of our Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility and capital expenditures related to the relocation of the Bridgeton, Missouri facility to Jefferson, City, Missouri.

Cash used in financing activities of $1.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were due to a reduction of $5.8 million in our bank borrowings and $2.1 million of debt issuance costs since December 31, 2015, partially offset by proceeds of $6.5 million from additional borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Facility.  Cash provided by financing activities of $25.6 million in the nine months ended September 25, 2015 were due to an increase of $25.7 million in our bank borrowings, net of debt issuance costs since December 31, 2014, primarily due to the Tiffin, Ohio manufacturing facility acquisition.

On November 16, 2016, the Borrowers under the BMO Credit Agreement entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with Encina Business Credit SPV, LLC, as agent and swing line lender, and the lenders party thereto (the  Encina Credit Agreement ).  The Encina Credit Agreement provides the Borrowers with a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, including a $2.5 million sub-limit for letters of credit and a $2.5 million sub-limit for swing line loans, a term loan in the principal amount of $3.5 million ( Term Loan A ) and a term loan in the principal amount of $3.1 million ( Term Loan B ).

The proceeds of the initial borrowings under the Encina Credit Agreement, which totaled $19.9 million (including Term Loan A and Term Loan B), were used to repay all the outstanding borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement (which was then terminated) and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the negotiation and consummation of the Encina Credit Agreement and the termination of the BMO Credit Agreement.  All extensions of credit under the Encina Credit Agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon substantially all present and future assets and properties of the Borrowers.

Borrowings under the revolving portion of the Encina Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 5.25% per annum plus the greater of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate and 0.5%.  Term Loan A bears interest at a rate equal to 5.75% per annum plus the greater of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate and 0.5%, and Term Loan B bears interest at a rate equal to 6% per annum plus the greater of the LIBOR (One Month) Rate and 0.5%.  The maturity date of the borrowings under the Encina Credit Agreement is November 16, 2019.  The Borrowers are required to make monthly amortization payments in respect of Term Loan A and Term Loan B commencing in November 2017.

The Encina Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and restrictions, including, among other things, restrictions on the ability of the Borrowers to create or permit liens on assets, make certain investments and make certain acquisitions or dispositions.  Under the Encina Credit Agreement, the Centrex earnout payments (see Note 10) may not be satisfied until all obligations under the Encina Credit Agreement are paid in full, except that the Centrex earnout payments may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock as described in Note 4. In addition, payments in respect of indebtedness under the Second Lien Credit Facility are restricted pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement with the SL Agent, except for certain payments out of excess cash flow as described more fully below.

Upon termination of the BMO Credit Agreement, an early termination fee of $0.3 million was paid by the Company and an additional termination fee of $0.4 million is payable by the Company in equal installments over 12 months following the termination date.

In connection with the  Encina Credit Agreement , the SL Obligors, Victory Park Management (as SL Agent) and the VPC SBIC Fund (as lender) entered into the Fifth Amendment to Second Lien Credit and Security Agreement and Limited Waiver (the  Fifth Amendment ) on November 16, 2016 to further amend the Second Lien Credit Facility.  The Fifth Amendment was primarily designed to conform certain representations, warranties and covenants in the Second Lien Credit Facility to the Encina Credit Agreement and further to (i) extend the maturity date of the obligations under the Second Lien Credit Facility to the date that is three months after the maturity of the obligations to the lenders under the Encina Credit Agreement, (ii) provide for the SL Borrowers to pay the lender under the Second Lien Credit Facility, if permitted under the intercreditor agreement with the SL Agent, up to 75% of excess cash flow so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is continuing under the Encina Credit Agreement and certain other financial conditions are satisfied, and (iii) suspend compliance with all existing financial covenants in the Second Lien Credit Facility (except for the limit on annual consolidated capital expenditures of $4.0 million) until the earlier of maturity or payment in full of the obligations under the Encina Credit Agreement. 

The foregoing descriptions of the Encina Credit Agreement and the Fifth Amendment do  not purport to be complete and  are  subject to, and qualified in  their  entirety by, the full text of  such documents , which  are  filed as  Exhibits  10.3  and 10.4  to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and  are  incorporated herein by reference.

If the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings exceed the Borrowing Base ("  Overadvance  ") at any time, the excess amount shall be payable by Borrowers on demand by Agent, but all such Revolving Loans shall nevertheless constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral and entitled to all benefits of the Loan Documents.  Any funding or sufferance of an Overadvance shall not constitute a waiver of the Event of Default caused thereby. 

(c)               Term A Loan Commitments  .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make a Term A Loan to the Borrowers on the Closing Date, in an amount not to exceed such Lender's Term A Loan Commitment.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent may disburse the proceeds of any Protective Advance to a Borrower or to such other Person(s) as Agent determines in its sole discretion.  All Protective Advances shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, shall bear interest at the rate applicable to all other Revolving Loans and shall be payable within three (3) Business Days of written demand therefor.  Agent's determination that funding or permitting a Protective Advance is appropriate shall be conclusive.  Each Revolving Lender's obligation to fund its Applicable Percentage of any Protective Advance permitted hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) the failure of any conditions set forth in   Article V   hereof to be satisfied, (B) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against Agent, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (C) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (D) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

If the Borrowers fail so to reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing or payment (the "  Unreimbursed Amount  "), and the amount of such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.  In such event, the Borrower Agent shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Revolving Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in   Section 2.02   for the principal amount of Revolving Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment of all Lenders and the conditions set forth in   Section 5.02   (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice).

Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer in Dollars. 

(iii)            With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing because the conditions set forth in   Section 5.02   cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Revolving Lender's payment to Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(ii)   shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this   Section 2.03  . 

(iv)            Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.

No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 

(vi)            If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.03(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.03(c)(ii)  , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the overnight rate (determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation) from time to time in effect,   plus   any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.

All computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,   provided   that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to   Section 2.11  , bear interest for one day.  Each determination by Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

2.10          Evidence of Debt .

(a)              Loan Account  .  The Credit Extensions made by the Lenders shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by Agent (the "  Loan Account  ") in the ordinary course of business.  In addition, each Lender may record in such Lender's internal records, an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan from such Lender, each payment and prepayment of principal of any such Loan, and each payment of interest, fees and other amounts due in connection with the Obligations due to such Lender.  The accounts or records maintained by Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by Agent to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 

2.11          Payments Generally; Agent's Clawback .

(a)              General  .  All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Subject to   Section 2.16   and payments made from the Concentration Account, Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office.  All payments received by Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected on computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 

-59- 

(b)               Presumptions by Agent  . 

(i)                Funding by Lenders  .  Unless Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with   Section 2.02   and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation,   plus   any administrative, processing or similar fees charged by Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans, in each case, without penalty or premium.  If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such interest to Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Agent or as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 

(ii)               Payments by Borrower  .  Unless Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower Agent prior to the time at which any payment is due to Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 

(iii)            A notice of Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 

(c)                Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent  .  If any Lender makes available to Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this   Article II  , and such funds are not made available to the Borrowers by Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in    Article V   are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 

-60- 

(d)               Obligations of Lenders Several  .  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to   Section 11.04(c)   are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under   Section 11.04(c)   on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under   Section 11.04(c)  . 

(e)               Funding Source  .  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 

(f)                Insufficient Funds  .  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied as provided in   Section 2.05(b)  . 

2.12         Sharing of Payments by Lenders.   If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) the Loan Obligations due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Loan Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Loan Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Loan Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) the Loan Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Loan Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Loan Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Loan Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then, in each case under clauses (a) and (b) above, the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify Agent of such fact, and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Loan Obligations then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that:

(i)              if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 

(ii)             the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) the application of Cash Collateral, or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 

-61- 

(iii)            Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 

2.13            Settlement Among Lenders . 

(a)             The amount of each Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of outstanding Revolving Loans shall be computed weekly (or more frequently in Agent's discretion) and shall be adjusted upward or downward based on all Revolving Loans and repayments of Revolving Loans received by Agent as of 3:00 p.m. on the first Business Day (such date, the "  Settlement Date  ") following the end of the period specified by Agent. 

(b)             Agent shall deliver to each of the Revolving Lenders promptly after a Settlement Date a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans for the period and the amount of repayments received for the period.  As reflected on the summary statement, (i)  Agent shall transfer to each Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage of repayments, and (ii) each Revolving Lender shall transfer to Agent (as provided below) or shall transfer to each Revolving Lender, such amounts as are necessary to insure that, after giving effect to all such transfers, the Revolving Credit Outstandings of each Revolving Lender shall be equal to such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of all the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings as of such Settlement Date.  If the summary statement requires transfers to be made to Agent by the Revolving Lenders and is received prior to 1:00 p.m. on a Business Day, such transfers shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 3:00 p.m. that day; and, if received after 1:00 p.m., then no later than 3:00 p.m. on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Revolving Lender to transfer such funds is irrevocable, unconditional and without recourse to or warranty by Agent.  If and to the extent any Revolving Lender shall not have so made its transfer to Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to Agent, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to Agent, equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation   plus   any reasonable administrative, processing, or similar fees charged by Agent in connection with the foregoing. 

2.14         Nature and Extent of Each Borrower's Liability .

(a)               Joint and Several Liability  .  Each Borrower agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for all Obligations except Excluded Swap Obligations and all agreements under the Loan Documents.  Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligations hereunder constitute a continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection, that such obligations shall not be discharged until the Facility Termination Date, and that such obligations are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of (i) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability, subordination or any future modification of, or change in, any Obligations or Loan Document, or any other document, instrument or agreement to which any Borrower is or may become a party or be bound; (ii) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this Section) or any other Loan Document, or any waiver, consent or indulgence of any kind by Agent or any Lender with respect thereto; (iii) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect a Lien or to preserve rights against, any security or guaranty for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by Agent or any Lender in respect thereof (including the release of any security or guaranty); (iv) the insolvency of any Borrower; (v) any election by Agent or any Lender in proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws for the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (vi) any borrowing or grant of a Lien by any other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; (vii) the disallowance of any claims of Agent or any Lender against any Borrower for the repayment of any Obligations under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; or (viii) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, except full payment in cash or Cash Collateralization of all Obligations on the Facility Termination Date. 

-62- 

(b)              Waivers  . 

(i)              Each Borrower expressly waives all rights that it may have now or in the future under any statute, at common law, in equity or otherwise, to compel Agent or any Lender to marshal assets or to proceed against any Borrower, other Person or security for the payment or performance of any Obligations before, or as a condition to, proceeding against such Borrower.  Each Borrower waives all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor other than full payment of all Obligations.  It is agreed among each Borrower, Agent and each Lender that the provisions of this   Section 2.12   are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents and that, but for such provisions, Agent and the Lenders would decline to make Loans and issue Letters of Credit.  Each Borrower acknowledges that its guaranty pursuant to this   Section   is necessary to the conduct and promotion of its business, and can be expected to benefit such business. 

(ii)             Agent and the Lenders may, in their discretion, pursue such rights and remedies as they deem appropriate, including realization upon Collateral by judicial foreclosure or nonjudicial sale or enforcement, without affecting any rights and remedies under this   Section 2.12  .  If, in taking any action in connection with the exercise of any rights or remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any other rights or remedies, including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or other Person, whether because of any Applicable Laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or otherwise, each Borrower consents to such action and waives any claim based upon it, even if the action may result in loss of any rights of subrogation that such Borrower might otherwise have had.  Any election of remedies that results in denial or impairment of the right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations.  Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any security for the Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower's rights of subrogation against any other Person.  Agent may bid all or a portion of the Obligations at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale, and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent but shall be credited against the Obligations.  The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent or any other Person is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral, and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this   Section 2.12  , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale. 

(c)               Extent of Liability; Contribution  . 

(i)              Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Borrower's liability under this   Section 2.12   shall be limited to the greater of (i) all amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable, as described below, and (ii) such Borrower's Allocable Amount. 

-63- 

(ii)             If any Borrower makes a payment under this   Section 2.12   of any Obligations (other than amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable) (a "  Guarantor Payment  ") that, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments previously or concurrently made by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount that such Borrower would otherwise have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payments in the same proportion that such Borrower's Allocable Amount bore to the total Allocable Amounts of all Borrowers, then such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and to be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.  The "  Allocable Amount  " for any Borrower shall be the maximum amount that could then be recovered from such Borrower under this   Section 2.12   without rendering such payment voidable under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state fraudulent transfer or conveyance act, or similar statute or common law. 

(iii)            Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP when its guaranty of or grant of a Lien as security for a Swap Obligation becomes effective hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP's obligations and undertakings under this   Section 2.12   voidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer or conveyance act).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP under this   Section   shall remain in full force and effect until Payment in Full of the Obligations.  Each Loan Party intends this   Section   to constitute, and this   Section   shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a "keepwell, support or other agreement" for the benefit of, each Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. 

(d)               Direct Liability; Separate Borrowing Availability  .  Nothing contained in this   Section 2.12   shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay Loans made directly or indirectly to that Borrower (including Loans advanced to any other Borrower and then re-loaned or otherwise transferred to, or for the benefit of, such Borrower), L/C Obligations relating to Letters of Credit issued to support such Borrower's business, and all accrued interest, fees, expenses and other related Obligations with respect thereto, for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable for all purposes hereunder. 

(e)               Joint Enterprise  .  Each Borrower has requested that Agent and the Lenders make this credit facility available to Borrowers on a combined basis, in order to finance Borrowers' business most efficiently and economically.  The Borrowers' business is a mutual and collective enterprise, and the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent upon the successful performance of the integrated group.  The Borrowers believe that consolidation of their credit facility will enhance the borrowing power of each Borrower and ease administration of the facility, all to their mutual advantage.  The Borrowers acknowledge that Agent's and the Lenders' willingness to extend credit and to administer the Collateral on a combined basis hereunder is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at Borrowers' request. 

(f)               Subordination  .  Each Loan Party hereby subordinates any claims, including any rights at law or in equity to payment, subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off, that it may have at any time against any other Loan Party, howsoever arising, to the full payment in cash or Cash Collateralization of all Obligations on the Facility Termination Date. 

-64- 

(g)              Borrower Agent.  

(i)              Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and designates CCP ("  Borrower Agent  ") as its representative and agent and attorney-in-fact for all purposes under the Loan Documents, including requests for Credit Extensions, designation of interest rates, delivery or receipt of communications, preparation and delivery of Borrowing Base and financial reports, receipt and payment of Obligations, requests for waivers, amendments or other accommodations, actions under the Loan Documents (including in respect of compliance with covenants), and all other dealings with Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender. 

(ii)             Each other Loan Party hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the Borrower Agent as its agent and attorney-in-fact to receive statements on account and all other notices from Agent and the Lenders with respect to the Obligations or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

(iii)            Any notice, election, representation, warranty, agreement or undertaking by or on behalf of any Loan Party by the Borrower Agent shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Loan Party and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Loan Party to the same extent as if made directly by such Loan Party. 

(iv)            The Borrower Agent hereby accepts the appointment by each Loan Party hereunder to act as its agent and attorney-in-fact. 

(v)            Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any notice or communication (including any notice of borrowing) delivered by Borrower Agent on behalf of any Borrower or other Loan Party.  Agent and the Lenders may give any notice to or communication with a Borrower or other Loan Party hereunder to Borrower Agent on behalf of such Borrower or Loan Party.  Each of Agent, L/C Issuer and each Lender shall have the right, in its discretion, to deal exclusively with Borrower Agent for any or all purposes under the Loan Documents.  Each Borrower and each other Loan Party agrees that any notice, election, communication, representation, agreement or undertaking made on its behalf by Borrower Agent shall be binding upon and enforceable against it. 

2.15             Cash Collateral . 

(a)               Certain Credit Support Events  .  If (i) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, or (ii) the Borrowers shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following any request by Agent, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount. 

(b)              Grant of Security Interest  .  The Borrowers hereby grant to (and subjects to the control of) Agent and agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to   Section 2.13(c)  .  If at any time Agent determines that Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by Agent, pay or provide to Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.  All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Agent. 

-65- 

(c)               Application  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans, shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 

2.16            Defaulting Lenders and Substitution of Lenders . 

(a)               Adjustments  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 

(i)                Waivers and Amendments  .  Such Defaulting Lender's right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" and   Section 11.01  . 

(ii)               Reallocation of Payments  .  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to   Article IX   or otherwise) or received by Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 11.08   shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Agent as follows:   first  , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Agent hereunder;   second  , if such Defaulting Lender is a Revolving Lender, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;   third  , if such Defaulting Lender is a Revolving Lender, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer's and Agent's Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with   Section 2.15  ;   fourth  , as the Borrower Agent may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists) to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Agent;   fifth  , if so determined by Agent and the Borrower Agent, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender's potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) if such Defaulting Lender is a Revolving Lender, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer's and Agent's future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit and Protective Advances;   sixth  , in the case of a Defaulting Lender under any Facility, to the payment of any obligations owing to the other Lenders under such Facility (in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, including the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender) as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender under such Facility (in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, including the L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender) against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   seventh  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   eighth  , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided   that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in   Section 5.02   were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders under the applicable Facility on a pro rata basis (and ratably among all applicable Facilities computed in accordance with the Defaulting Lenders' respective funding deficiencies) prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender under the applicable Facility until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans and Protective Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to   Section 2.16(a)(iv)  .  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this   Section 2.16(a)(ii)   shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 

-66- 

(iii)              Certain Fees  .  No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Unused Fee payable pursuant to   Section 2.09(a)   for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  Each Defaulting Lender which is a Revolving Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to   Section 2.15  .  With respect to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this clause (iii), the Borrowers shall (A) pay to each non-Defaulting Lender which is a Revolving Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender's participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer's Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 

(iv)              Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender's participation in L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans and Protective Advances shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders which are Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in   Section 5.02   are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower Agent shall have otherwise notified Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Outstandings of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender's increased exposure following such reallocation. 

(b)               Defaulting Lender Cure  .  If the Borrower, Agent and, in the case that a Defaulting Lender is a Revolving Lender, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit, Swing Line Loans and Protective Advances to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to   Section 2.16(a)(iv)  ), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.

(c)               Substitution of Lender.    In the event (a) the Borrowers receive a claim from any Lender for compensation under   Section 3.01   or   3.04   hereof, (b) the Borrowers receive notice from any Lender of any illegality pursuant to   Section 3.02   hereof, (c) any Lender is then a Defaulting Lender or such Lender is a Subsidiary or Affiliate of a Person who after the Closing Date has been deemed insolvent or becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or a receiver or conservator has been appointed for any such Person, or (d) a Lender fails to consent to an amendment or waiver as a Non-Consenting Lender the effectiveness of which requires the consent of such Lender at a time when the Required Lenders have approved such amendment or waiver (any such Lender referred to in clause (a), (b), (c), or (d) above being hereinafter referred to as an "  Affected Lender  "), the Borrower may, in addition to any other rights the Borrower may have hereunder or under applicable law, require, at its reasonable expense, any such Affected Lender to assign, at par, without recourse, all of its interest, rights, and obligations hereunder (including all of its Commitments and the Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit and other amounts at any time owing to it hereunder and the other Loan Documents) to an Eligible Assignee specified by the Borrower Agent,  provided,  that (i) such assignment shall not conflict with or violate any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other governmental authority, (ii) the Borrower shall have paid to the Affected Lender all monies other than such principal owing to it hereunder, (iii) the assignment is entered into in accordance with, and subject to the consents required by,   Section 11.06   hereof (provided any assignment fees (unless waived) and reasonable reimbursable expenses due thereunder shall be paid by the Borrowers) and such Affected Lender is paid such principal owing to it hereunder and (iv) in the case of an Affected Lender, described in the preceding clause (d), the Eligible Assignee specified by the Borrower consents to such amendment or waiver.  If the Affected Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver the applicable Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such substitution, the Affected Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this   Section 2.16(c)  .

(b)              Borrowing Procedures  .  Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower Agent's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and Agent, which may be given by telephone.  Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day.  Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Agent.  Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will (i) deliver notice to the Borrower Agent and Agent as to whether it will or will not make such Swing Line Loan available to the Borrowers and, if agreeing to make such Swing Line Loan, (ii) confirm with Agent (by telephone or in writing) that Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.  Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of   Section 2.17(a)  , or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in   ARTICLE V   is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender may, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower Agent at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower Agent on the books of the Swing Line Lender in Same Day Funds. 

(c)               Refinancing of Swing Line Loans  . 

(i)              The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, but no less frequently than weekly, may request, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Revolving Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of   Section 2.02   without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in   Section 5.02  .  The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower Agent with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to Agent.  Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to Agent in Same Day Funds (and Agent may apply cash collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at Agent's Office not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to   Section 2.17(c)(ii)  , each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to the Borrowers in such amount.  Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. 

(ii)             If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with   Section 2.17(c)(i)  , the request for Revolving Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Lender's payment to Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17(c)(i)   shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 

-69- 

(iii)            If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.17(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.17(c)(i)  , the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable overnight rate (determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation) from time to time in effect,   plus   any administrative processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(iv)            Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.17(c)   shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided  ,   however  , that each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.17(c)   is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 5.02  .  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 

(v)             All refinancings and fundings under this   Section 2.17(c)   shall be in addition to and without duplication of the settlement procedures and obligations under   Section 2.13  . 

(d)              Repayment of Participations  .  At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Lender's risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 

(e)              Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender  .  The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrowers for interest on the Swing Line Loans.  Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or risk participation pursuant to this   Section 2.17   to refinance such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 

(f)               Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender  .  The Borrowers shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.

If, however, applicable Laws require the Loan Parties to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by the Borrower Agent, Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to   subsection (d)   below.

(b)               Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers  .  Without limiting the provisions of   subsection (a)   above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Borrower Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Borrower Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Borrower Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in   Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A)  ,   (ii)(B)   and   (ii)(D)   below) shall not be required if in the applicable Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 

(ii)             Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,

(C)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Borrower Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Borrower Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Borrower Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

(D)            if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable) such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Borrower Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Borrower Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) any such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Borrower Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Borrower Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

(f)             Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 

(g)              Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  If Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section  , it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by any Loan Party under this   Section   with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),   provided   that each Loan Party, upon the request of Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to any Loan Party (  plus   any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in the event Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Loan Parties shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, such Lender shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until Agent is advised in writing by such Lender it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Loan Parties shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

3.03          Inability to Determine Rates .  If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and an interest period of one (1) month of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one (1) month with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one (1) month with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower Agent and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower Agent may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(ii)             subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit, or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by   Section 3.01   and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or 

(iii)            impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

If, however, the insurance policies do not provide waiver of subrogation rights against such parties, as required above, then the Loan Parties hereby agree, to the extent permitted by law, to waive their right of recovery, if any, against the Credit Parties and their agents and employees.  The designation of any form, type or amount of insurance coverage by the any Credit Party under this   Section 7.07   shall in no event be deemed a representation, warranty or advice by such Credit Party that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of the business of the Loan Parties or the protection of their properties.

In such case, Agent shall have the right to receive all Condemnation Awards and Insurance Proceeds, and may deduct therefrom any and all of its expenses incurred at any time incurred in connection therewith.

Each Borrower agrees to diligently assert its rights and remedies with respect to each such claim and to promptly pursue the settlement and compromise of each such claim subject to Agent's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  If, prior to the receipt by Agent of any Condemnation Award or Insurance Proceeds, any Real Estate shall have been sold pursuant to the provisions of a Mortgage, Agent shall have the right to receive such funds.  If any Condemnation Awards or Insurance Proceeds are paid to a Borrower, that Borrower shall receive the same in trust for Agent.  Within five (5) days after Borrower's receipt of any Condemnation Awards or Insurance Proceeds, such Borrower shall deliver such awards or proceeds to Agent in the form in which they were received, together with any endorsements or documents that may be necessary to effectively negotiate or transfer the same to Agent.  Each Borrower agrees to execute and deliver from time to time, upon the request of Agent, such further instruments or documents as may be requested by Agent to confirm the grant and assignment to Agent of any Condemnation Awards or Insurance Proceeds.

Net Cash Proceeds may be utilized for the restoration of such Real Estate only if no Default shall exist and only if in the reasonable judgment of Agent (i) there has been no material adverse change in the financial viability of the improvements on such Real Estate, (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds, together with other funds deposited with Agent for that purpose, are sufficient to pay the cost of the restoration pursuant to a budget and plans and specifications approved by Agent, (iii) the restoration can be completed prior to the Maturity Date and prior to the date required by any purchase and sale agreement or by any Lease, and (iv) following restoration, such Real Estate will have a fair market value at least equal to its fair market value immediately prior to the Event of Loss.  Otherwise, Net Cash Proceeds shall be utilized for payment of the Obligations in such order and in such proportions as determined by Agent in its sole discretion. 

(b)            If Net Cash Proceeds are to be utilized for the restoration of such Real Estate, (i) the Borrowers shall, at their sole cost and expense, promptly commence and diligently and continuously perform to completion the restoration in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all Laws and the requirements of the Permitted Liens, whether or not the Borrowers shall have satisfied the requirements of this   Section 7.08(b)   in order to cause the Net Cash Proceeds to be made available for such restoration and whether or not such insurance proceeds on account of the Casualty shall be sufficient for such purpose, and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds, together with any other funds deposited with Agent for that purpose, must be deposited in a an account maintained by Agent solely for the purposes described in this   Section 7.08   ("  Borrower's Deposit Account  "), which shall be a non-interest-bearing account.  Subject to the terms of this   Section 7.08  , Agent shall have the exclusive right to manage and control all funds in the Borrower's Deposit Account, but Agent shall have no fiduciary duty with respect to such funds.  Prior to the advance by Agent of any funds so deposited and the commencement of such restoration, the Borrowers shall take all steps necessary to avoid the imposition of any mechanics' liens on the Real Estate or the improvements thereon.  Thereafter, Agent will advance the deposited funds from time to time to the Borrowers for the payment of costs of restoration of the Real Estate upon presentation of evidence by the Borrowers acceptable to Agent that such portion of the restoration has been completed satisfactorily and Lien-free.  If at any time Agent reasonably determines that there is a deficiency in the funds available in the Borrower's Deposit Account to complete the restoration as contemplated, then the Borrowers shall promptly deposit in the Borrower's Deposit Account additional funds equal to the amount of the deficiency.  Any account fees and charges may be deducted from the balance, if any, in the Borrower's Deposit Account.

(c)            Each Borrower grants to Agent (for itself and on behalf of the Credit Parties) a security interest in the Borrower's Deposit Account and all funds hereafter deposited to such deposit account, and any proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations.  Such security interest shall be governed by the UCC, and Agent shall have available to it all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party thereunder.  The Borrower's Deposit Account may be established and held in such name or names as Agent shall deem appropriate, including in the name of Agent.  Each Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints Agent and any officer or agent of Agent its true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with full power of substitution to open the Borrower's Deposit Account and to do any and every act that Borrower might do on its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this Section, provided, however, Agent shall not exercise such power (other than the power to open the Borrower's Deposit Account) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  To the extent permitted by Law, each Borrower hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.  It is understood and agreed that this power of attorney, which shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest, cannot be revoked.

If consent of the Borrower Agent is provided, Agent shall give at least ten (10) Business Days' advance notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower Agent, to appoint a successor, which shall be an Eligible Assignee.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above;   provided   that if Agent shall notify the Borrower Agent and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall not become effective in accordance with such notice and the retiring Agent shall not be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

(c)                       Register  .  Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes) (in such capacity, subject to   Section 11.17  ), shall maintain at Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and Loan Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "  Register  ").

(d)                      Participations  .  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or Agent, sell participations to any Eligible Assignee (each, a "  Participant  ") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Credit Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans) owing to it);   provided   that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrowers, Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) no Participant shall be granted any right to consent to any amendment, except to the extent any of the same pertain to (1) reducing the aggregate principal amount of, or interest rate on, or fees applicable to, any Loan or (2) extending the final stated maturity of any Loan or the stated maturity of any portion of any payment of principal of, or interest of fees applicable to, any of the Loans;   provided   that the rights described in this subclause (2) shall not be deemed to include the right to consent to any amendment with respect to or which has the effect of requiring any mandatory prepayment of any portion of any Loan or any amendment or waiver of any Default. 

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided  , that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to   Section 11.01   that affects such Participant.  Subject to   subsection (c)   of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 3.01  , and   3.04   to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   subsection (b)   of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 11.08   as though it were the Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.13   as though it were a Lender.

A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Sections 3.01,     3.04   or   3.05   than the Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower Agent's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were the Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.01   unless the Borrower Agent is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with   Section 3.01(g)   as though it were the Lender. 

(f)                       Pledges by Lenders  .  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;   provided  , that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  Each Loan Party agrees to execute all agreements, instruments and documents reasonably requested by such Lender in connection with any such assignment.

For purposes of this   Section  , "  Information  " means all information received from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary relating to a Loan Party or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to any Credit Party on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by a Loan Party or any Subsidiary,   provided   that, in the case of information received from a Loan Party or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, any information not marked "PUBLIC" at the time of delivery will be deemed to be confidential; provided, that any information marked "PUBLIC may also be marked "Confidential".  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this   Section   shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

-136-

(vi)            In the event any cash payments made pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) are less than the amount of quarterly accrued interest at the PIK Interest Rate on the Term Loans for such prior quarterly period computed pursuant to   Section 2.07(a)(i)   and   (ii)   hereof, such cash payments shall be applied to (a) first, accrued interest for such period on the Priority Term Loan A until such amount is paid in full, and (b) second, accrued interest for such period on the Existing Term Loan.

The accounts or records maintained by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.

2.12            Nature and Extent of Each Borrower s Liability . 

(a)               Joint and Several Liability  .  Each Borrower agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for all Obligations and all agreements under the Loan Documents.  Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligations hereunder constitute a continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection, that such obligations shall not be discharged until the Termination Date, and that such obligations are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of (i) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability, subordination or any future modification of, or change in, any Obligations or Loan Document, or any other document, instrument or agreement to which any Borrower is or may become a party or be bound; (ii) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this Section) or any other Loan Document, or any waiver, consent or indulgence of any kind by the Agent with respect thereto; (iii) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect a Lien or to preserve rights against, any security or guaranty for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by the Agent in respect thereof (including the release of any security or guaranty); (iv) the insolvency of any Borrower; (v) any election by the Agent in proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws for the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (vi) any borrowing or grant of a Lien by any other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; (vii) the disallowance of any claims of the Agent against any Borrower for the repayment of any Obligations under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; or (viii) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, except full payment in cash of all Obligations on the Termination Date. 

(b)               Waivers  . 

(i)              Each Borrower expressly waives all rights that it may have now or in the future under any statute, at common law, in equity or otherwise, to compel the Credit Parties to marshal assets or to proceed against any Borrower, other Person or security for the payment or performance of any Obligations before, or as a condition to, proceeding against such Borrower.  Each Borrower waives all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor other than full payment of all Obligations.  It is agreed among each Borrower, the Credit Parties that the provisions of this   Section 2.12   are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents and that, but for such provisions, the Credit Parties would decline to make Loans.  Each Borrower acknowledges that its guaranty pursuant to this   Section 2.12   is necessary to the conduct and promotion of its business, and can be expected to benefit such business. 

(ii)             The Credit Parties may, in their discretion, pursue such rights and remedies as they deem appropriate, including realization upon Collateral by judicial foreclosure or nonjudicial sale or enforcement, without affecting any rights and remedies under this   Section 2.12  .  If, in taking any action in connection with the exercise of any rights or remedies, the Credit Parties shall forfeit any other rights or remedies, including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or other Person, whether because of any Applicable Laws pertaining to  election of remedies  or otherwise, each Borrower consents to such action and waives any claim based upon it, even if the action may result in loss of any rights of subrogation that such Borrower might otherwise have had.  Any election of remedies that results in denial or impairment of the right of the Credit Parties to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower s obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations.  Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any security for the Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower s rights of subrogation against any other Person.  The Credit Parties may bid all or a portion of the Obligations at any foreclosure or trustee s sale or at any private sale, and the amount of such bid need not be paid by the Credit Parties but shall be credited against the Obligations.  The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether the Credit Parties or any other Person is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral, and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this   Section 2.12  , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which the Credit Parties might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale. 

39 

(c)               Extent of Liability; Contribution  . 

(i)              Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Borrower s liability under this   Section 2.12   shall be limited to the greater of (i) all amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable, as described below, and (ii) such Borrower s Allocable Amount. 

(ii)             If any Borrower makes a payment under this   Section 2.12   of any Obligations (other than amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable) (a    Guarantor Payment   ) that, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments previously or concurrently made by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount that such Borrower would otherwise have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payments in the same proportion that such Borrower s Allocable Amount bore to the total Allocable Amounts of all Borrowers, then such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and to be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.  The    Allocable Amount    for any Borrower shall be the maximum amount that could then be recovered from such Borrower under this   Section 2.12   without rendering such payment voidable under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state fraudulent transfer or conveyance act, or similar statute or common law. 

(d)               Direct Liability  .  Nothing contained in this   Section 2.12   shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay Loans made directly or indirectly to that Borrower and all accrued interest, fees, expenses and other related Obligations with respect thereto, for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable for all purposes hereunder. 

(e)               Joint Enterprise  .  Each Borrower has requested that the Lenders make this credit facility available to Borrowers on a combined basis, in order to finance Borrowers  business most efficiently and economically.  The Borrowers  business is a mutual and collective enterprise, and the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent upon the successful performance of the integrated group.  The Borrowers believe that consolidation of their credit facility will enhance the borrowing power of each Borrower and ease administration of the facility, all to their mutual advantage.  The Borrowers acknowledge that the Lender s willingness to extend credit and to administer the Collateral on a combined basis hereunder is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at Borrowers  request. 

(f)                Subordination  .  Each Loan Party hereby subordinates any claims, including any rights at law or in equity to payment, subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off, that it may have at any time against any other Loan Party, howsoever arising, to the full payment in cash of all Obligations on the Termination Date. 

40 

(g)              Borrower Agent.  

(i)              Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and designates CCP (   Borrower Agent   ) as its representative and agent and attorney-in-fact for all purposes under the Loan Documents, including requests for Credit Extensions, designation of interest rates, delivery or receipt of communications, preparation and delivery of financial reports, receipt and payment of Obligations, requests for waivers, amendments or other accommodations, actions under the Loan Documents (including in respect of compliance with covenants), and all other dealings with the Agent. 

(ii)             Each other Loan Party hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the Borrower Agent as its agent and attorney-in-fact to receive statements on account and all other notices from the Agent with respect to the Obligations or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

If, however, the insurance policies do not provide waiver of subrogation rights against such parties, as required above, then the Loan Parties hereby agree, to the extent permitted by law, to waive their right of recovery, if any, against the Credit Parties and their agents and employees.  The designation of any form, type or amount of insurance coverage by the any Credit Party under this   Section 7.07   shall in no event be deemed a representation, warranty or advice by such Credit Party that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of the business of the Loan Parties or the protection of their properties.

(i)              The Agent is authorized, at its sole and absolute option, to commence, appear in and prosecute, in its own or any Borrower s name, any action or proceeding relating to any Event of Loss, and to make proof of loss for and to settle or compromise any claim in connection therewith.  In such case, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agent shall have the right to receive all Condemnation Awards and Insurance Proceeds, and may deduct therefrom any and all of its expenses incurred at any time incurred in connection therewith.  However, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Borrowers are diligently pursuing their rights and remedies with respect to any claim arising from such Event of Loss, the Agent will obtain the Borrower Agent s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before making proof of loss for or settling or compromising such claim.  Each Borrower agrees to diligently assert its rights and remedies with respect to each such claim and to promptly pursue the settlement and compromise of each such claim subject to the Agent s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  If, prior to the receipt by the Agent of any Condemnation Award or Insurance Proceeds, any Real Estate shall have been sold pursuant to the provisions of a Mortgage, the Agent shall have the right to receive such funds.  If any Condemnation Awards or Insurance Proceeds are paid to a Borrower, that Borrower shall receive the same in trust for the Agent.  Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, within five (5) days after Borrower s receipt of any Condemnation Awards or Insurance Proceeds, such Borrower shall deliver such awards or proceeds to the Agent in the form in which they were received, together with any endorsements or documents that may be necessary to effectively negotiate or transfer the same to the Agent.  Each Borrower agrees to execute and deliver from time to time, upon the request of the Agent, such further instruments or documents as may be requested by the Agent to confirm the grant and assignment to Agent of any Condemnation Awards or Insurance Proceeds. 

7.08            Utilization of Net Proceeds . 

(a)             Net Cash Proceeds arising from any Event of Loss with respect to any Real Estate must be utilized either for payment of the Obligations or for the restoration of such Real Estate.  Net Cash Proceeds may be utilized for the restoration of such Real Estate only if no Default shall exist and only if in the reasonable judgment of the Agent (i) there has been no material adverse change in the financial viability of the improvements on such Real Estate, (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds, together with other funds deposited with the Agent for that purpose, are sufficient to pay the cost of the restoration pursuant to a budget and plans and specifications approved by the Agent, (iii) the restoration can be completed prior to the Maturity Date and prior to the date required by any purchase and sale agreement or by any Lease, and (iv) following restoration, such Real Estate will have a fair market value at least equal to its fair market value immediately prior to the Event of Loss.  Otherwise, Net Cash Proceeds shall be utilized for payment of the Obligations in such order and in such proportions as determined by the Agent in its sole discretion. 

(b)             If Net Cash Proceeds are to be utilized for the restoration of such Real Estate, (i) the Borrowers shall, at their sole cost and expense, promptly commence and diligently and continuously perform to completion the restoration in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all Laws and the requirements of the Permitted Liens, whether or not the Borrowers shall have satisfied the requirements of this   Section 7.08   in order to cause the Net Cash Proceeds to be made available for such restoration and whether or not such insurance proceeds on account of the Casualty shall be sufficient for such purpose, and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds, together with any other funds deposited with the Agent for that purpose, must be deposited in an account maintained by the First Lien Agent that is subject to a Control Agreement or, upon Payment in Full of First Lien Priority Debt, in an account maintained by the Agent that is subject to a Control Agreement, solely for the purposes described in this   Section 7.08   (   Borrower s Deposit Account   ), which shall be a non-interest-bearing account.  Subject to the terms of   Section 4.08   and this   Section 7.08  , the Agent shall have the exclusive right to manage and control all funds in the Borrower s Deposit Account, but the Agent shall have no fiduciary duty with respect to such funds.  Prior to the advance by the Agent of any funds so deposited and the commencement of such restoration, the Borrowers shall take all steps necessary to avoid the imposition of any mechanics  liens on the Real Estate or the improvements thereon.  Thereafter, the Agent will advance the deposited funds from time to time to the Borrowers for the payment of costs of restoration of the Real Estate upon presentation of evidence by the Borrowers acceptable to the Agent that such portion of the restoration has been completed satisfactorily and Lien-free.  If at any time the Agent reasonably determines that there is a deficiency in the funds available in the Borrower s Deposit Account to complete the restoration as contemplated, then the Borrowers shall promptly deposit in the Borrower s Deposit Account additional funds equal to the amount of the deficiency.  Any account fees and charges may be deducted from the balance, if any, in the Borrower s Deposit Account. 

70 

(c)             Each Borrower grants to Agent, on behalf of the Credit Parties, a security interest in the Borrower s Deposit Account and all funds hereafter deposited to such deposit account, and any proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations.  Such security interest shall be governed by the UCC, and the Agent shall have available to it all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party thereunder.  The Borrower s Deposit Account may be established and held in such name or names as the Agent shall deem appropriate, including in the name of the Agent.  Each Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints the Agent and any officer or agent of the Agent its true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with full power of substitution to open the Borrower s Deposit Account and to do any and every act that Borrower might do on its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this   Section 7.08  ;   provided  ,   however  , the Agent shall not exercise such power (other than the power to open the Borrower s Deposit Account) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  To the extent permitted by Law, each Borrower hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.  It is understood and agreed that this power of attorney, which shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest, cannot be revoked.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any enforceable term of any promissory note, contract, agreement, permit, lease, license (including any licenses of any Intellectual Property) or other General Intangible included as a part of the Collateral, other than Accounts, requires the consent of the Person obligated on such promissory note or any Person (other than the applicable obligor) obligated on such lease, contract or agreement, or which has issued such permit or license or other General Intangible, other than Accounts, for the assignment or transfer thereof or the enforcement of such Lien not to give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination or other material remedy thereunder, then the receipt of any such necessary consent shall be a condition to any exercise of remedies against such Collateral under this   Section 9.04   (but not to the creation, attachment or perfection of the Lien of the Agent for the benefit of the Credit Parties as provided herein). 

9.05            Joint and Several .  Each obligation and liability of each Borrower to the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, the Obligations, are the joint and several obligations of each Borrower, and the Credit Parties may proceed directly against any Borrower, or all Borrowers, or any Guarantor, or any Collateral, or all of the foregoing, or any one of the foregoing or any combination of the foregoing, without first proceeding against Borrower or any Collateral, or without joining all Persons liable or potentially liable for any portion of the Obligations in one action.  Each Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable as primary obligor and not merely as surety for repayment of all Obligations arising under the Loan Documents.  Such joint and several liability shall apply to each Borrower regardless of whether any Loan was only requested by or on behalf of or made to any other Borrower or the proceeds of any Loan were used only by or on behalf of any other Borrower or any indemnification obligation or any other obligation arose only as a result of the action of any other Borrower.  If any Borrower makes a payment in respect of the Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, it shall have the rights of contribution described in this Section below and under applicable common law against the other Borrower or Borrowers;   provided   that such Borrower shall not exercise its right of contribution until all of the Obligations are Paid in Full;   provided  ,   however  , that Agent, for the benefit of the Credit Parties, is hereby granted a Lien in such right of contribution and may enforce such right upon the occurrence and during the continuance of Event of Default.  It is the intent of each Borrower and Lender that each Borrower s maximum obligation to repay the Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (the    Loan Obligation Limit   ) shall not exceed the greater of (i) the amount actually borrowed or received directly or indirectly by such Borrower with respect thereto and (ii) the amount which is $1.00 less than the amount which, if recorded by such Borrower as a liability, would render such Borrower not Solvent.  To the extent that any Borrower makes a payment on any of the Obligations (a    Loan Obligation Payment   ), such Borrower (the    Entitled Borrower   ) is entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and reimbursement by, each other Borrower (a    Contributing Borrower   ) in the amount of the Contribution Obligation of such Contributing Borrower hereunder.  The    Contribution Obligation    of a Contributing Borrower with respect to the Loan Obligation Payment of an Entitled Borrower is an amount equal to the greater of (1) the lesser of (x) such Contributing Borrower s Loan Obligation Limit at the time the Loan Obligation Payment is made and (y) such Contributing Borrower s Allocable Share of the Loan Obligation Payment, and (2) the amount of all proceeds from the Obligations actually received by such Contributing Borrower or applied by the recipient thereof directly or indirectly for the benefit of such Contributing Borrower, less the sum of any repayments thereof and any Loan Obligation Payments made by such Contributing Borrower prior to the time the applicable Loan Obligation Payment is made.  The    Allocable Share    of a Contributing Borrower is a fraction, the numerator of which is such Contributing Borrower s Loan Obligation Limit at the time the applicable Loan Obligation Payment is made and the denominator of which is the sum of the Loan Obligation Limits of all of the Contributing Borrowers (plus a similarly computed amount for any Guarantor which has a similar obligation to make a contribution) as of such time.

(b)             shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law; and 

(c)             shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Loan Parties or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

10.04          Reliance by Agent .  The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including, but not limited to, any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.

(ii)             Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Term Loan assigned. 

(iii)            Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment other than (x) the consent of the Agent shall be required for assignments in respect of the Term Loan if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender and (y) if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the consent of the Borrowers shall be required if such assignment is to a Competitor. 

(iv)            Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500,   provided  ,   however  , that the Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. 

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this   Section 11.06  , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 3.01  ,   3.04  and   11.04   with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Upon request, the Borrowers (at their expense) shall execute and deliver a Term Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with   Section 11.06(d)  .

102 

(c)               Register  .  The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the principal amounts and interest of the Term Loan (and any Term Note) owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Loan Parties, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any assignment or other transfer in whole or in part of interests in this Agreement or the Term Loan (or Term Note) shall be effective only by registration in the Register. The appointment of a Registrar and maintenance of a Register is intended to result in this Agreement and the Term Loan (and Term Note) being at all times in  registered form  within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.871-14(c) and Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent therewith.  To avoid any doubt, the provisions of this   Sections 11.06(c)   and   11.06(d)   shall apply to any Term Note (to the same extent applicable to a Term Loan) and to any transfer, assignment or participation of rights thereunder. 

(d)               Participations  .  The Lenders may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower sell participations to any Person (other than, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to a Competitor without the prior written consent of the Borrower) (each, a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of the Lenders  rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (i) the Lenders  obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Lenders shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrowers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) no Participant shall be granted any right to consent to any amendment, except to the extent any of the same pertain to (1) reducing the aggregate principal amount of, or interest rate on, or fees applicable to, any Loan or (2) extending the final stated maturity of any Loan or the stated maturity of any portion of any payment of principal of, or interest of fees applicable to, any of the Loans;   provided   that the rights described in this subclause (2) shall not be deemed to include the right to consent to any amendment with respect to or which has the effect of requiring any mandatory prepayment of any portion of any Loan or any amendment or waiver of any Default. 

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement.  Subject to   subsection (c)   of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 3.01  , and   3.04   to the same extent as if it were such Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   subsection (b)   of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 11.08   as though it were such Lender.

(e)               Limitations upon Participant Rights  .  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Sections 3.01,     3.04   or   3.05   than a Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower Agent s prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.01   unless the Borrower Agent is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with   Section 3.01(g)   as though it were a Lender. 

103 

11.07          Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality .
