NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS (LOSS)    
  Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT II, Inc. (the  Company ) was organized in Maryland on   September 28, 2012  .  The Company offered up to   100,000,000   shares of common stock in its primary initial public offering for   $10   per share, with volume discounts available to investors who purchased   $1.0   million or more of shares through the same participating broker-dealer.  Discounts were also available for other categories of investors. The Company is also offering up to   10,000,000   shares pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan at a purchase price equal to   $8.56   per share (  $9.50   per share prior to March 31, 2016).  The Company has adopted a fiscal year ending December 31.  On   February 6, 2014  , the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) declared effective the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-11, as amended (Commission File No. 333-184476) (the  Registration Statement ), relating to the offering of up to   110,000,000   shares of the Company s common stock, including shares offered pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan. The primary portion of the offering closed on   February 10, 2016  . 
  Resource Real Estate Opportunity Advisor II, LLC (the "Advisor ) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Resource Real Estate, Inc. (the "Sponsor") and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ( RAI ), operating in the real estate, financial fund management and commercial finance sectors. The Advisor acts as the Company's external advisor and manages the Company's day-to-day operations and its portfolio of real estate investments and provides asset-management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on the Company's behalf, all subject to the supervision of the Company's Board of Directors.  On   October 9, 2012  , the Advisor contributed   $200,000   to the Company in exchange for   20,000   shares of common stock.  On   December 20, 2013  , the Advisor received   50,000   shares of convertible stock in exchange for   5,000   shares of the Company s common stock.  The Advisor purchased an additional   117,778   shares of common stock in 2014 for   $1.1 million  . 
    
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III Capital Partners, LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate 
  services company engaged in a broad range of activities. C-III controls our Advisor and Resource Securities, Inc., ( Resource 
  Securities ), the Company's dealer manager, and Resource Real Estate Opportunity Manager II, LLC, the Company's property manager; C-III also controls all of the shares of common stock held by RAI. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   58,479,988   shares, including the additional shares purchased by the Advisor and shares issued through the distribution reinvestment plan (but excluding shares issued through stock distributions), have been issued in connection with the Company's public offering resulting in gross offering proceeds of   $575.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued   2,673,691   shares for   $24.1 million   pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan. 
  The Company s objective is to take advantage of the Sponsor's dedicated multifamily investing and lending platforms to invest in multifamily assets across the entire spectrum of investments in order to provide stockholders with growing cash flow and increasing asset values. The Company s targeted portfolio will consist, at the time of acquisition, of commercial real estate assets, principally (i) underperforming multifamily rental properties which the Company will renovate and stabilize in order to increase rents, (ii) distressed real estate owned by financial institutions, usually as a result of foreclosure, and non-performing or distressed loans, including first- and second-priority mortgage loans and other loans which the Company will resolve, and (iii) performing loans, including first- and second-priority mortgage loans and other loans the Company originates or purchases either directly or with a co-investor or joint venture partner.  
  The Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As such, to maintain its REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute at least 90% of its net income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders as well as comply with certain other requirements. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent that it annually distributes at least 100% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. The Company also operates its business in a manner that is intended to permit it to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Real Estate Investments 
  The Company records acquired real estate at fair value on its acquisition date. The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life.  The Company's estimated useful lives of its assets by class are as follows:

      Tenant improvements

      Lease intangibles 
    Remaining term of related lease 

As   four   of the Company's multifamily properties are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,   two   properties are located in Portland, Oregon,   two   properties are located in  the Atlanta area and   two   properties are located in the Denver area, our portfolio is currently particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in these real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for multifamily rentals resulting from the local business climate, could negatively affect our liquidity and adversely affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations. 
  Impairment of Long Lived Assets 
  When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.  This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.  These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.  
  If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, the Company allocates the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings, fixtures and improvements, identified intangible lease assets, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, as applicable, the value of in-place leases, the value of tenant relationships, and liabilities, based in each case on their fair values. 
  Fair value estimates are based on information obtained from a number of sources, including information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities. In addition, the Company may obtain independent appraisal reports. The information in the appraisal reports, along with the aforementioned information available to the Company's management, is used in allocating the purchase price. The independent appraisers have no involvement in management's allocation decisions other than providing market information. 
  The Company records above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.  The Company amortizes any capitalized above-market or below-market lease values as an increase or reduction to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases.  
  The Company measures the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant.  Management s estimates of value are expected to be made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors to be considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. 
  In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs have not already been incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall relationship with that respective tenant.  Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the Company s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. 
  The Company amortizes the value of in-place leases to expense over the remaining term of the underlying leases.  The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does amortization periods for the intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and relationship intangibles related to that customer would be charged to expense in that period.   
  The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to current market rental rates, discount rates and other variables.  These estimates are subject to change until all information is finalized, which is generally within   one year   of the acquisition date.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company recognizes minimum rent, including rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and includes amounts expected to be received in later years in deferred rents.  The Company records property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred. 
  The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement associated with the property.  If the criteria for profit recognition under the full-accrual method are not met, the Company defers the gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the percentage-of-completion, reduced profit, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the appropriate criteria are met. 
  The future minimum rental payments to be received from noncancelable operating leases are   $33.2 million   and   $250,588   for the 12-month periods ending   September 30  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively, and   none   thereafter. 
  Tenant Receivables 
  The Company makes estimates of the collectability of its tenant receivables related to base rents, including straight-line rentals, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income.  The Company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historic bad debts, tenant creditworthiness, current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, the Company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable.  In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed   one year  .  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were allowances for uncollectible accounts of   $14,103   and   $194  , respectively. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the Company will generally not be subject to corporate U.S. federal or state income tax to the extent that it makes qualifying distributions to its stockholders, and provided it satisfies on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, the REIT requirements including certain asset, income, distribution and stock ownership tests. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, it will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which it lost its REIT qualification. Accordingly, the Company s failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders. 
  The dividends paid deduction of a REIT for qualifying dividends to its stockholders is computed using the Company s taxable income as opposed to net income reported on the financial statements. Taxable income, generally, will differ from net income reported on the financial statements because the determination of taxable income is based on tax provisions and not financial accounting principles.

The Company may elect to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). In general, the Company s TRSs may hold assets and engage in activities that the Company cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business.  A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. 
  While a TRS may generate net income, a TRS can declare dividends to the Company which will be included in the Company s taxable income and necessitate a distribution to its stockholders. Conversely, if the Company retains earnings at a TRS level, no distribution is required and the Company can increase book equity of the consolidated entity. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no TRSs. 
  Earnings Per Share 
    Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted to common stock. Due to reported losses for the current periods presented, the convertible shares (discussed in Note 11) are not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they would be anti-dilutive. All common shares and per common share information in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively for the effect of one   0.625%   stock distribution issued on   July 14, 2014  , one   1.00%   stock distribution issued   October 15, 2014  , one   0.83333%   stock distribution issued on   January 15, 2015  , one   0.5%   stock distribution issued on   April 15, 2015  , and one   0.5%   stock distribution issued on   July 15, 2015  .  
  Correction of an Immaterial Error 
    During the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company made an adjustment  to correct an immaterial error related to the accrual of real estate taxes. As a result of this error, the Company increased accounts payable and accrued expenses and rental properties by   $832,283  , respectively. The adjustment impacts the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Note 5- Rental Properties, net and Note 6 - Acquisitions as of   December 31, 2015  . This correction had no impact of earnings or cash flows. 
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  The Company incurred organizational, accounting, and offering costs in pursuit of its financing. Organization and offering costs (other than selling commissions and dealer-manager fees) of the Company were initially paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company. Organization costs were expensed as incurred and included all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the formation of the Company, including, but not limited to, legal fees and other costs to incorporate the Company.  
  Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement between the Company and the Advisor dated January 9, 2014, as amended (the  Advisory Agreement ), the Company is obligated to reimburse the Advisor for organizational and offering costs it incurred on the Company's behalf, but only to the extent that such reimbursements did not cause organizational and offering expenses (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fees) to exceed    2.5%   of the gross offering proceeds raised in the offering, when recorded by the Company. The primary portion of the offering closed on   February 10, 2016  , at which point total organizational and offering costs incurred did not exceed   2.5%   of the gross offering proceeds raised in the offering. 
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $11.2 million   for the payment of offering costs consisting of accounting, advertising, allocated payroll, due diligence, marketing, legal and similar costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor had incurred   $7.2 million   of these costs on behalf of the Company. A portion of these costs was charged to equity upon the sale of each share of common stock sold under the public offering. Similarly, a portion of the proceeds received from the sales of shares in the Company's public offering was paid to the Advisor to reimburse it for the amount incurred on behalf of the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had reimbursed all   $7.2 million   of deferred offering costs to the Advisor.   
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items". The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. On

January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-01 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis", which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. ASU 2015-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. The Company applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and adjusted the balance sheet of each individual period presented to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. This guidance was effective and was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified   $2.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs at   December 31, 2015   from assets to liabilities as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable. 
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments", which eliminates the requirement to retroactively revise comparative financial information for prior periods presented in financial statements due to changes in provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in subsequent periods.  Upon adoption, disclosure of the amounts recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date are required.   ASU 2015-16 was effective and adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
             
     Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective 
    
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." Under the new guidance, an entity should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
    In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases", which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions and requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments", which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  The guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the Company's consolidated cash flows.

  NOTE 11 - EQUITY    
  Preferred Stock 
  The Company s charter authorizes the Company to issue   10,000,000   shares of its   $0.01   par value preferred stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding. 
  Convertible Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   50,000   shares of   $0.01   par value convertible stock outstanding, which are owned by the Advisor and affiliated persons. The convertible stock will convert into shares of the Company s common stock upon the occurrence of (a) the Company having paid distributions to common stockholders that in the aggregate equal   100%   of the price at which the Company originally sold the shares plus an amount sufficient to produce a   7%   cumulative, non-compounded annual return on the shares at that price; or (b) if the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange and, on or after the 31st trading day following the listing, the Company s value based on the average trading price of its common stock since the listing, plus prior distributions, combine to meet the same   7%   return threshold. 
  Each of these   two   events is a  Triggering Event.   Upon a Triggering Event, the Company's convertible stock will, unless its advisory agreement has been terminated or not renewed on account of a material breach by its Advisor, generally be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to 1/50,000 of the quotient of:  
           (A) 
    the lesser of 
     (i)      25%   of the amount, if any, by which  
           (1) 
    the value of the Company as of the date of the event triggering the conversion plus the total distributions paid to its stockholders through such date on the then-outstanding shares of its common stock exceeds 
              (2) 
    the sum of the aggregate issue price of those outstanding shares plus a   10%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the issue price of those outstanding shares as of the date of the event triggering the conversion, or  
     (ii)      15%   of the amount, if any, by which  
           (1) 
    the value of the Company as of the date of the event triggering the conversion plus the total distributions paid to its stockholders through such date on the then-outstanding shares of its common stock exceeds  
              (2) 
    the sum of the aggregate issue price of those outstanding shares plus a   6%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the issue price of those outstanding shares as of the date of the event triggering the conversion, divided by 
              (B) 
    the value of the Company divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, in each case, as of the date of the event triggering the conversion.

Redemptions 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company redeemed shares as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

(1) 
    All purchases of equity securities by the Company in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were made pursuant to the Company's share redemption program. 
              (2) 
    The Company currently limits the dollar value and number of shares that may be repurchased under the program, as discussed below. 
     All redemption requests tendered during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were honored during that period. 
  The Company will not redeem in excess of   5%   of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the   12  -month period immediately prior to the effective date of redemption.  Generally, the cash available for redemption will be limited to proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan plus, if the Company had positive operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year,   1%   of all operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year.  These limitations apply to all redemptions, including redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or confinement to a long-term care facility.   
    
  The Company's board of directors, in its sole discretion, may suspend, terminate or amend the Company's share redemption program without stockholder approval upon   30   days' notice if it determines that such suspension, termination or amendment is in the Company's best interest. The Company's board may also reduce the number of shares purchased under the share redemption program if it determines the funds otherwise available to fund the Company's share redemption program are needed for other

On   September 30, 2016  , the Board of Directors approved distributions in an amount of   $0.00164384    per share of common stock for stockholders of record each day in the period from   September 30, 2016   through and including   December 29, 2016  , payable on   October 31, 2016  ,   November 30, 2016   and   December 30, 2016  . 
   
  NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE MEASURES AND DISCLOSURES    
  In analyzing the fair value of its investments accounted for on a fair value basis, the Company follows the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.  The fair value of cash, tenant receivables and accounts payable, approximate their carrying value due to their short nature.  The hierarchy followed defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
    Level 1 -   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.

  RESOURCE REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY REIT II, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

Level 2 -   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability. 
    Level 3 -   Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment.  The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.  However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare. 
  The fair value of rental properties is usually estimated based on information obtained from a number of sources, including information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities.  The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings, fixtures and improvements, and identified intangible lease assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, as applicable, the value of in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values.     
    
  Derivatives (interest rate caps) which are reported at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are valued by a third party pricing agent using an income approach with models that use, as their primary inputs, readily observable market parameters. This valuation process considers factors including interest rate yield curves, time value, credit and volatility factors (Level 2). 
    
  The following table presents information about the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and 
  indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value as follows (in thousands): 

Interest rate caps are included in Prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The cancelable swap is included in Derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet. 
  The outstanding balance and estimated fair value of the Company s mortgage notes payable are as follows (in thousands):

The fair value of the mortgage notes payable with fixed interest rates was estimated using rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 3). The fair values of   eight   of the mortgage notes payable with variable interest rates equals the carrying amounts because the variable interest rate of each credit facility is considered a market rate (Level 3). 
   
  NOTE 13 - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings. 
  As a condition of the Company s mortgage loans, from time to time the Company may be required to enter into certain derivative transactions as may be required by the lender.  These transactions would generally be in line with the Company s own risk management objectives and also serve to protect the lender. 
  Interest Rate Caps 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company entered into interest rate caps that were designated as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows, indexed to London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), associated with existing variable-rate loan agreements.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not record any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings.  
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional   $46,846   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 
  Cancelable swaps 
    To manage its exposure to interest rate movements, the Company has also entered into a cancelable interest rate swap    that was not designated as a hedging instrument. Interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives (dollars in thousands):

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features  
  The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain provisions where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements, was   $300,070  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If

the Company had breached any of these provisions at   September 30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $300,070  . 
   
  NOTE 14 - OPERATING EXPENSE LIMITATION    
  As required under the Company's charter, the Advisor must reimburse the Company the amount by which the aggregate total operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters then ended exceed the greater of   2%   of the average invested assets or   25%   of net income, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.   Average invested assets  means the average monthly book value of assets invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in and loans secured by real estate during the 12-month period before deducting depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves.   Total operating expenses  means all expenses paid or incurred by the Company, as determined under GAAP, that are in any way related to operations, including advisory fees, but excluding (a) the expenses of raising capital such as organization and offering expenses, legal, audit, accounting, underwriting, brokerage, listing, registration and other fees, printing and other such expenses and taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, distribution, transfer, registration and stock exchange listing of stock; (b) interest payments; (c) taxes; (d) non-cash expenditures such as depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves; (e) reasonable incentive fees based on the gain in the sale of assets; and (f) acquisition fees, acquisition expenses (including expenses relating to potential investments that do not close), disposition fees on the resale of property and other expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition and ownership of real estate interests, loans or other property (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair and improvement of property). Operating expenses for the four quarters ended   September 30, 2016   did not exceed the charter imposed limitation.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, RRE Opportunity OP II, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and to their subsidiaries. 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expects,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   project,   should,   will  and  would  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may be required under applicable law.   
  Overview 
  We are a Maryland corporation that invests in multifamily assets across the entire spectrum of investments in order to provide investors with growing cash flow and increasing asset values.   Our targeted portfolio will consist, at the time of acquisition, of commercial real estate assets, principally (i) underperforming multifamily rental properties which we will renovate and stabilize in order to increase rents, (ii) distressed real estate owned by financial institutions, usually as a result of foreclosure, and non-performing or distressed loans, including first- and second-priority mortgage loans and other loans which we will resolve, and (iii) performing loans, including first- and second-priority mortgage loans and other loans we originate or purchase either directly or with a co-investor or joint venture partner. We believe multiple opportunities exist within the multifamily industry today and will continue to present themselves over the next few years to real estate investors who possess the following characteristics: (i) extensive experience in multifamily investing, (ii) strong management platforms specializing in operational and financial performance optimization, (iii) financial sophistication allowing them to benefit from complex opportunities and (iv) the overall scale and breadth of a national real estate platform in both the equity and debt markets. We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forego a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. Thus, to the extent that Resource Real Estate Opportunity Advisor II, LLC, our external advisor, or the Advisor, presents us with investment opportunities that allow us to meet the requirements to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code, and to maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our portfolio composition may vary from what we initially expect. 
  We commenced the public offering of our common stock in February 2014 and terminated the primary portion of the offering in February 2016. We describe this offering in  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  below. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  We were formed on   September 28, 2012  .  We commenced active real estate operations on June 4, 2014 with the acquisition of our first multi-family property.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   14   multifamily properties. Our management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable, or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting our targeted portfolio, the multifamily residential housing industry and real estate generally, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the operation of such assets or those that we expect to acquire.

Three   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table sets forth the results of our operations (in thousands): 

Revenues.    Rental income increased by   $11.3 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is due to the acquisition of   seven   additional properties since   September 30, 2015  .  
  Expenses.    Our operating expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were from the ongoing operations of our business and the ownership of   14   operating properties.  
  Acquisition costs decreased by   $3.0 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , as we did not purchase any properties during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , while we acquired   three   multifamily properties during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   with a purchase price of   $92.3 million  . 
  Management fees increased by   $2.0 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to the increase in the asset management fees paid to the Advisor related to the ownership of   seven   additional properties since   September 30, 2015  . The asset management fee is equal to one-twelfth of 1.0% of the cost of each asset, without deduction for deprecation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves.

Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table sets forth the results of our operations (in thousands): 

Revenues.    Rental income increased by   $29.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is due to the acquisition of   seven   additional properties since   September 30, 2015  .  
  Expenses.    Our operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were from the ongoing operations of our business and the ownership of   14   operating properties.  
  Acquisition costs increased by   $1.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the acquisition of   four   multifamily properties during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with an aggregate purchase price of   $268.8 million   versus the acquisition of   five   multifamily properties during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   with an aggregate purchase price of   $171.6 million  . 
  Management fees increased by   $5.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to the increase in the asset management fee paid to the Advisor related to the ownership of   seven   additional properties since   September 30, 2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  From February 2014 to February 2016, we offered in our public offering up to   $1.0 billion   in shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at   $10   per share. At the termination of the primary offering, we had raised  $556.2 million   in gross proceed. We also offered and continue to offer up to   $95.0 million   in shares of our common stock to be issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan under which our stockholders may elect to have distributions reinvested in additional shares at   $8.56   per share (  $9.50   per share prior to   March 31, 2016  ).  
  We derive the capital required to purchase real estate investments and conduct our operations from the  remaining proceeds of our public offering from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, from proceeds from the sale of assets and from any undistributed funds from our operations.  
  We intend to allocate funds as necessary to aid our objective of preserving value for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If such allocations and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investment in one or more properties, debt investments or other assets we may hold. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access additional funds when we need them or upon acceptable terms. 
  We may seek to obtain REIT-level financing through a line of credit from third-party financial institutions or other commercial lenders.  Our assets will serve as collateral for this type of debt incurred to acquire real estate investments.  In addition to debt financing at the REIT-level, we have financed, and may continue to finance, the acquisition costs of individual real estate investments, as well as the acquisition costs of all or a group of real estate investments acquired by us, by causing our subsidiaries to borrow directly from third-party financial institutions or other commercial lenders.  Under these circumstances, our Advisor anticipates that certain properties will serve as collateral for the debt we incur to acquire those particular properties and that we will seek to obtain nonrecourse financing for the acquisition of the properties.  However, there is no guarantee that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining financing arrangements on a property-by-property basis and that the loans would be nonrecourse to us.  Finally, we may also obtain seller financing with respect to specific assets that we acquire.  
  Capital Expenditures     
  We deployed a total of   $22.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for capital expenditures. The properties in which we deployed the most capital during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are listed separately and the capital expenditures made on all other properties are aggregated in "All other properties" below (in thousands):

As four of our multifamily properties are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, two of our properties are located in  the Atlanta area, two of our properties are located in Portland, Oregon and two of our properties are located in the Denver area, our portfolio is currently particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in these real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for multifamily rentals resulting from the local business climate, could negatively affect our liquidity and adversely affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations. 
  Organization and Offering Costs     
  Our Advisor advanced funds to us for certain organization and offering costs.  We reimbursed the Advisor for all of the expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor or its affiliates on our behalf or in connection with the services provided to us in relation to our public offering.  This included all organization and offering costs other than selling commissions and dealer  manager fees, but only to the extent that such reimbursement would not have caused organizational and offering expenses (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) to exceed 2.5% of gross offering proceeds as of the date of such reimbursement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor advanced a total of   $7.2 million   for organization and offering costs and received   $7.2 million   in reimbursements.     
  Acquisition and Asset Management Costs       
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make payments to our Advisor. During our acquisition stage, we expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments.  In addition, we expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor for the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us.  We describe these payments in more detail in Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Operating Expenses 
  Under our charter, our Advisor must reimburse us the amount by which our aggregate total operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters then ended exceed the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.   Average invested assets  means the average monthly book value of our assets invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in and loans secured by real estate during the 12-month period before deducting depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves.   Total operating expenses  means all expenses paid or incurred by us, as determined under GAAP, that are in any way related to our operation, including advisory fees, but excluding (a) the expenses of raising capital such as organization and offering expenses, legal, audit, accounting, underwriting, brokerage, listing, registration and other fees, printing and other such expenses and taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, distribution, transfer, registration and stock exchange listing of our stock; (b) interest payments; (c) taxes; (d) non-cash expenditures such as depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves; (e) reasonable incentive fees based on the gain in the sale of our assets; and (f) acquisition fees, acquisition expenses (including expenses relating to potential investments that we do not close), disposition fees on the resale of property and other expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition and ownership of real estate interests, loans or other property (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair and improvement of property). Operating expenses for the four quarters ended   September 30, 2016   did not exceed the charter imposed limitation.

Distributions declared, distributions paid and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were as follows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands, except per share data):

On   September 30, 2016  , our Board of Directors approved distributions in an amount of   $0.00164384    per share of common stock for stockholders of record each day in the period from   September 30, 2016   through and including   December 29, 2016  , payable on   October 31, 2016  ,   November 30, 2016   and   December 30, 2016  . 
   
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  Funds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance.  We use FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts to be net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains (or losses) from sales of property (including deemed sales and settlements of pre-existing relationships), plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets, and after related adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and subsidiaries and noncontrolling interests.  We believe that FFO is helpful to our investors and our management as a measure of operating performance because it excludes real estate-related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and extraordinary items, and as a result, when compared year to year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which are not immediately apparent from net income.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate and intangibles diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient.  As a result, our management believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, is helpful for our investors in understanding our performance.  Factors that impact FFO include start-up costs, fixed costs, delays in buying assets, lower yields on cash held in accounts, income from portfolio properties and other portfolio assets, interest rates on acquisition financing and operating expenses.  In addition, FFO will be affected by the types of investments in our targeted portfolio which will consist of, but are not limited to, commercial real estate assets, principally  (i) underperforming multifamily rental properties which we will renovate and stabilize in order to increase rents, (ii) distressed real estate owned by financial institutions, usually as a result of foreclosure, and non-performing or distressed loans, including first- and second-priority mortgage loans and other loans which we will resolve, and (iii) performing loans, including first- and second-priority mortgage loans and other loans we originate or purchase either directly or with a co-investor or joint venture partner. 
  Since FFO was promulgated, GAAP has adopted several new accounting pronouncements, such that management and many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of FFO alone to be insufficient. Accordingly, in addition to FFO, we use modified funds from operations, or MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, or IPA.  MFFO excludes from FFO the following items: 
           (1) 
    acquisition fees and expenses; 
              (2) 
    straight-line rent amounts, both income and expense; 
              (3) 
    amortization of above- or below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; 
              (4) 
    amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments; 
              (5) 
    impairment charges; 
              (6) 
    gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; 
              (7) 
    gains or losses on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivatives holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our operations; 
              (8) 
    gains or losses related to fair-value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, including interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives; 
              (9) 
    gains or losses related to consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; 
              (10) 
    gains or losses related to contingent purchase price adjustments; and 
              (11) 
    adjustments related to the above items for unconsolidated entities in the application of equity accounting. 
     We believe that MFFO is helpful in assisting management assess the sustainability of operating performance     in future periods and, in particular, after our acquisition stage is complete, primarily because it excludes acquisition expenses that affect property operations only in the period in which the property is acquired.  Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of acquisition expenses is the most significant adjustment to us at the present time, as we are currently in our  acquisition stage.  Thus, MFFO provides helpful information relevant to evaluating our operating performance in periods in which there is no acquisition activity.     
  As explained below, management s evaluation of our operating performance excludes the items considered in the calculation based on the following economic considerations.  Many of the adjustments in arriving at MFFO are not applicable to us.  Nevertheless, we explain below the reasons for each of the adjustments made in arriving at our MFFO definition:

     (Back to Index)  

Acquisition expenses.   In evaluating investments in real estate, including both business combinations and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, management s investment models and analysis differentiate costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Prior to 2009, acquisition costs for both of these types of investments were capitalized under GAAP; however, beginning in 2009, acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed.  Both of these acquisition costs have been and will continue to be funded from the proceeds of our offering and debt proceeds, and not from operations.  We believe by excluding expensed acquisition costs, MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.  Acquisition expenses include those paid to our Advisor or third parties. 
                
    Adjustments for straight-line rents and amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments  .  In the proper application of GAAP, rental receipts and discounts and premiums on debt investments are allocated to periods using various systematic methodologies. This application will result in income recognition that could be significantly different than underlying contract terms. By adjusting for these items, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance. 
                
    Adjustments for amortization of above or below market intangible lease assets  .  Similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangibles diminishes predictably over time and that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since real estate values and market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate. 
                
    Impairment charges, gains or losses related to fair-value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and gains or losses related to contingent purchase price adjustments  .  Each of these items relates to a fair value adjustment, which is based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions and specific performance of the holding which may not be directly attributable to current operating performance.  As these gains or losses relate to underlying long-term assets and liabilities, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information by focusing on the changes in our core operating fundamentals rather than changes that may reflect anticipated gains or losses. In particular, because GAAP impairment charges are not allowed to be reversed if the underlying fair values improve or because the timing of impairment charges may lag the onset of certain operating consequences, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information related to current consequences, benefits and sustainability related to rental rate, occupancy and other core operating fundamentals. 
                
    Adjustment for gains or losses related to early extinguishment of hedges, debt, consolidation or deconsolidation and contingent purchase price  .  Similar to extraordinary items excluded from FFO, these adjustments are not related to continuing operations.  By excluding these items, management believes that MFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods and to other real estate operators. 
     By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that also assists investors and analysts in the assessment of the sustainability of our operating performance after our acquisition stage is completed.  We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the real estate industry.  MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our acquisition stage is completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities or as affected by other MFFO adjustments.  However, investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our acquisition stage is completed, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance and the reported book value of our common stock and stockholders  equity during the periods in which properties are acquired. 
  Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), nor as an indication of our liquidity, nor are any of these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to fund distributions.  In particular, as we are currently in the acquisition phase of our life cycle, acquisition costs and other adjustments that are increases to MFFO are, and may continue to be, a significant use of cash.  Accordingly, FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.  Our FFO and MFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs.

The following section presents our calculation of FFO and MFFO and provides additional information related to our operations (in thousands, except per share amounts). As a result of the timing of the commencement of our initial public offering and our active real estate operations and the general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with these events. FFO and MFFO are not relevant to a discussion comparing operations for the two periods presented.  We expect revenues and expenses to increase in future periods as we acquire additional investments.

PART II.                      OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  All securities sold by us during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were sold in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). 
  Use of Proceeds 
  On   February 6, 2014  , our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-184476), covering a public offering of up to   100,000,000   shares of common stock in our primary offering and   10,000,000   shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan, was declared effective under the Securities Act. We retained Resource Securities, an affiliate of our advisor, as the dealer manager for our offering. We offered 100,000,000 shares of common stock in our primary offering at an aggregate offering price of up to $1.0 billion, or   $10   per share with discounts available to certain categories of purchasers. The   10,000,000   shares offered under our distribution reinvestment plan were initially offered at an offering price of $  9.50   per share, which price changed to $8.56 per share on March 31,2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , our advisor has incurred costs on our behalf of approximately   $7.2 million  . We terminated the primary portion of our initial public offering on February 6, 2016. We continue to offer shares to our existing stockholders pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. 
    
  A total of   58.7 million   shares, including shares purchased by our Advisor, were issued in connection with our public offering resulting in gross offering proceeds of   $579.9 million  . From the commencement of our public offering through   September 30, 2016  , we incurred selling commissions, dealer manager fees, other underwriting compensation and other organization and offering costs in the amounts set forth below.  We generally paid selling commissions and dealer manager fees to our affiliated dealer manager, Resource Securities, for the sale of shares in our primary offering and Resource Securities reallowed all selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers. In addition, we reimburse our Advisor and Resource Securities for certain organizational and offering costs (in thousands).     

The net offering proceeds to us from the primary portion of our public offering, after deducting the total expenses incurred as described above, were approximately   $525.8 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have used the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering and debt financing to acquire approximately   $510.0 million   in real estate investments.  Of the amount used for the purchase of these investments, approximately   $11.2 million   was paid to our Advisor as acquisition and advisory fees and acquisition expense reimbursements. 
  Share Redemption Program  
  Our board of directors has adopted a share redemption program that may enable stockholders to sell their shares to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations of the program.  In its sole discretion, our board of directors could choose to amend, suspend or terminate the program upon 30 days  notice without stockholder approval.  Except for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or confinement to a long-term care facility and prior to the time we established a net asset value ("NAV") per share of our common stock, the purchase price for shares redeemed under the redemption program was as follows:     
             
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least one year, 92.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least two years, 95.0% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least three years, 97.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; and 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least four years, 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us. 
     
   48 
   (Back to Index)  

     (Back to Index)  

The purchase price per share for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death or qualifying disability or confinement to a long-term care facility, will be equal to the average issue price per share of the stockholder s shares. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, until we established an NAV per share, shares received as a stock distribution were redeemed at a purchase price of $0 . In addition, the purchase price per share will be adjusted for any stock combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to the shares of common stock and reduced by the aggregate amount of net sale or refinance proceeds per share, if any, distributed to the redeeming stockholder prior to the redemption date. 
  In connection with the approval by our board of directors of an estimated value per share of our common stock of $9.01 on March 29, 2016, the price at which shares are now redeemed under our share redemption program is as follows: 

For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least one year, 92.5% of our estimated value per share, or $8.33; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least two years, 95.0% of our estimated share value, or $8.56; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least three years, 97.5% of our estimated share value, or $8.78; and 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least four years, 100% of our estimated share value, or $9.01. 
     We will not redeem in excess of 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the 12-month period immediately prior to the effective date of redemption.  Generally, the cash available for redemption will be limited to proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan plus, if we had positive operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year, 1% of all operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year.  These limitations apply to all redemptions, including redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or confinement to a long-term care facility.       
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not redeem or repurchase any of our shares.

  $37,300,000.00                                April 14, 2016 

1.      Payment of Principal and Interest     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, RRE CANTERWOOD HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "  Maker  "), hereby promises to pay to the order of ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, an Illinois insurance company, and any subsequent holder of this Note ("  Holder  " or "  Holders  ") in the manner hereinafter provided, the principal amount of THIRTY-SEVEN MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($37,300,000.00) together with interest on the outstanding principal balance from the date of the initial disbursement (for purposes of this Note, "disbursement" means the date funds are wire transferred from Holder's account) of all or a part of the principal of this Note ("  Disbursement Date  ") until maturity at the rate of three and eighty-nine hundredths percent  (3.89%) per annum ("  Contract Rate  ") as follows: 
    
  (a)    on the Disbursement Date, interest only, in advance, accruing from the Disbursement Date to the last day of April, 2016, both inclusive; and thereafter 
    
  (b)    interest only, in arrears, in consecutive equal installments of ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FOURTEEN and 17/100ths DOLLARS  ($  120,914.17  ) on the first day of June, 2016 and on the first day of each month thereafter until May 1, 2019, both inclusive (the    I/O Period    and thereafter 
  (c)      in arrears, on the first day of June, 2019 and on the first day of each month thereafter until this Note matures, principal and interest in consecutive equal installments of ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTEEN and 62/100ths DOLLARS ($  175,718.62  ), which amount is calculated using an amortization period of three hundred sixty (360) months (the payments described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 1 shall each hereinafter be referred to as "  Monthly Payment  "); and 
  (d)    on May 1, 2023 (the "  Maturity Date  "), the entire unpaid principal amount and any interest accrued but remaining unpaid and all other sums due under this Note. 
    
  Except for the interest payable under paragraph (a) above, interest shall be payable in arrears and calculated on the basis of a 360 day year containing twelve 30 day months.  All such payments on account of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall be first applied to interest accrued on the unpaid principal amount and the remainder toward reduction of the unpaid principal amount. 
    
  2.      Payment Information     All payments required to be made hereunder shall be made during regular business hours to Holder at its office, c/o Allstate Investments, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Division, Allstate Plaza South, Suite G5C, 3075 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois  60062, Attention: Servicing Manager, with sufficient information to identify the source and application of such payment to Holder's Loan No. 123564, or at such other place as Holder may from time to time designate in writing.  All payments shall be made in currency of United States of America without presentment or surrender of this Note.  Payments to Holder shall be made by transferring immediately available federal funds by bank wire or interbank transfer for the account of Holder.  Any payment of principal or interest received after 1:00 p.m., Chicago time, shall be deemed to have been received by Holder on the next business day and shall bear interest accordingly.  If and so long as Holder directs Maker to make payments to a servicing agent, then payments may be made by check.  Payments made by check will not be deemed made until good funds for such check are received by Holder or the servicing agent. 
    
  3.      Security For Note    The payment of the Note and all other sums due Holder is secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Contracts, Security Agreement, and Fixture Filing ("  Deed of Trust  "), of even date herewith, granted by Maker to the Public Trustee of Boulder County, Colorado, as trustee, for the benefit of Holder, covering certain real property, the improvements thereon and certain personal property situated in the County of Boulder, State of Colorado and described in the Deed of Trust ("  Property  "), and those certain instruments of indebtedness and security described as "Related Agreements" in the Deed of Trust.  Except as otherwise defined herein, all of the defined terms contained in the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements are hereby incorporated herein by express reference. 
    
  4.      Late Charges       If any Monthly Payment required under the Note is not paid in full on or before the fourth day after such payment is due, Maker acknowledges that the Holder will incur extra expenses for the handling of the delinquent payment and servicing the indebtedness evidenced hereby, and that the exact amount of these extra expenses is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain, but that a charge of five percent (5%) of the amount of the delinquent payment ("  Late Charge  ") would be a fair approximation of the expense so incurred by Holder.  If applicable law requires a lesser charge, however, then the maximum charge permitted by such law may be charged by Holder for said purpose.  Therefore, Maker shall, in such event, without further notice, and without prejudice to the right of Holder to collect any other amounts provided to be paid hereunder or under the Deed of Trust, the Related Agreements or any other instrument executed for purposes of further securing payment of the obligations evidenced by this Note, or to declare an Event of Default as defined below, pay to Holder immediately upon demand the Late Charge to compensate Holder for expenses incurred in handling delinquent payments. 
    
  5.      Interest Payable Upon Default     If there occurs an Event of Default, under the Note or the Deed of Trust or under any Related Agreement, then the unpaid principal amount of the Note, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest at the Contract Rate plus five percent (5%) per annum compounded monthly ("  Default Rate  ") from the date of expiration of any applicable cure or grace period until such time, if any, as the Event of Default is cured and the Deed of Trust and the Note are reinstated as permitted by applicable law, or otherwise until such time as the unpaid principal amount of the Note and all other indebtedness evidenced by the Note are fully repaid, whichever is earlier. 
    
  6.      Events of Default     An "Event of Default" shall exist under this Note: 
    
  (a)    in the event Maker shall fail to make any payment due under the Note, other than the final payment and Prepayment Premium (as defined herein), on or before the fourth day after such payment is due; 
    
  (b)    in the event Maker shall fail to make the final payment or the Prepayment Premium when such payment is due; or 
    
  (c)    [intentionally omitted]; or 
    
  (d)    if there shall exist an Event of Default under the Deed of Trust or any of the Related Agreements. 
    
  7.      Additional Payments     The additional payments called for under Paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be in addition to, and shall in no way limit, any other rights and remedies provided for in the Note, the Deed of Trust, any Related Agreements, or otherwise provided by law. 
    
  8.      Payment of Taxes and Expenses 
    
  (a)    Maker further promises to pay to Holder, immediately upon written notice from Holder:  (i)  all recordation, transfer, stamp, documentary or other fees or taxes levied on Holder (exclusive of Holder's income taxes) by reason of the making or recording of this Note, the Deed of Trust or any of the Related Agreements, and  (ii)  all intangible property taxes levied upon any Holder of this Note or mortgagee under the Deed of Trust or secured party under the Related Agreements. 
    
  (b)    Maker further promises to pay to Holder, immediately upon written notice from Holder, all actual costs, expenses, disbursements, escrow fees, title charges and reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Holder and its counsel in connection with:  (i)  the collection, attempted collection, or negotiation and documentation of any settlement or workout of any payment due hereunder, and  (ii)  any suit or proceeding whatsoever in regard to this Note or the protection or enforcement of the lien of any instrument securing this Note, including, without limitation, in any bankruptcy proceeding or judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceeding.  It is the intent of the parties that Maker pay all expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Holder as a result of Holder's entering into the loan transaction evidenced by this Note. 
    
  9.      Prepayment     (a) Maker is prohibited from prepaying this Note until May 1, 2018 (the "  No-Prepayment Period  ").  Subsequent to the No-Prepayment Period until May 1, 2019, at any time with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Holder, specifying the date of prepayment, Maker will have the privilege of prepaying the outstanding principal amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest, any other sums secured by the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements, and a prepayment premium ("  Prepayment Premium  ") equal to the greater of: 
    
  (a)  one percent (1%) of the principal amount prepaid, or 
    
  (b)  the yield maintenance payment calculated as follows: 
    
  If the Prevailing Interest Rate is less than the Contract Rate, the yield maintenance payment shall be the remainder of  (x) minus  (y)  where  "(x)"  is the present value of all unpaid installments of principal and interest due under this Note from the date of prepayment to and including the original maturity date of this Note, discounted at the Prevailing Interest Rate, and  "(y)"  is the outstanding principal balance of this Note as of the prepayment date.  The term "Prevailing Interest Rate" as used herein shall mean the yield to maturity on a United States Treasury Bond or Treasury Note, without call options,  selected by Holder having a maturity date as near as possible to the original maturity date of this Note and an "ask" price, as close as possible to par as published two weeks prior to the specified date of prepayment in   The Wall Street Journal   (including WSJ.com or other similar on-line versions thereof) or in another similar publication of comparable reliability and institutional acceptance  or available from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( Current Yield ), less the Basis Point Adjustment as computed in accordance with   Exhibit A   attached hereto to convert the monthly payments to a semi-annual equivalent. 
    
  Subsequent to May 1, 2019 until May 1, 2022, at any time with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Holder, specifying the date of prepayment, Maker shall have the privilege of prepaying the outstanding principal amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest, any other sums secured by the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements a Prepayment Premium equal to one percent (1%) of the principal amount prepaid.  No Prepayment Premium shall be due on the principal balance prepaid within the twelve (12) month period prior to the original Maturity Date of this Note.   
    
  (c)    Written notice of Maker's election to make a prepayment in full of this Note shall be given in the manner provided for notices under the Deed of Trust.  Partial prepayment of the outstanding principal amount of this Note shall not be permitted except in accordance with the terms of the Deed of Trust.  In the event of such a permitted partial prepayment, if any, the Prepayment Premium calculated in this Paragraph 9 shall be due, such Prepayment Premium shall be prorated based on the amount of the partial prepayment relative to the then current outstanding principal balance of this Note. 
    
  (d)    Maker acknowledges that Holder: 
    
           (i) 
    has advanced the amounts evidenced by this Note with the expectation that such amounts would be outstanding for a period at least equal to the No-Prepayment Period; 
       
           (ii) 
    would not have been willing to advance such amounts on these terms for a shorter period of time; 
       
           (iii) 
    in making the Loan evidenced by this Note, is relying on Maker's creditworthiness and its agreement to pay in strict accordance with the terms set forth in the Note; and 
       
           (iv) 
    would not make the Loan without full and complete assurance by Maker of its agreement not to prepay all or a part of the principal of this Note except as expressly permitted herein and in the Deed of Trust.  Maker has been advised and acknowledges that Holder is relying on the receipt of payments under this Note to, among other things, match and support its obligations under contracts entered into by Holder with third parties and that in the event of a prepayment, Holder could suffer loss and additional expenses which are extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain.  Accordingly, it is the express intent of Maker and Holder that  (A)  Maker shall have no right to prepay this Note during the No-Prepayment Period,  (B)  any prepayment of this Note during the No-Prepayment Period shall only occur in the event Holder accelerates payment under this Note or as otherwise permitted by or required under the Deed of Trust, (C)  any prepayment described in the foregoing clause (D) shall (unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Deed of Trust) require the payment of a Prepayment Premium calculated as provided for hereinabove; and  (E)  to the extent permitted by applicable law, Maker has waived, and hereby waives, any right to prepay this Note except as expressly provided in the Deed of Trust or this Note.  In the event, notwithstanding the foregoing express intent of Maker and Holder and the express waiver by Maker of any right to prepay this Note, that the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located permits the Maker to prepay this Note during the No-Prepayment Period, then the Prepayment Premium described in clause (C) above shall be paid to Holder as a condition to any such prepayment. 
       
  (e)    Maker expressly acknowledges that, pursuant to the provisions of this Note and except as otherwise provided in this Note or the Deed of Trust, Maker has no right to prepay this Note in whole or in part.  In the event any prepayment is required or expressly permitted, Maker shall be liable for the payment of the Prepayment Premium unless expressly stated otherwise herein or in the Deed of Trust.  Furthermore, Maker waives any rights it may have under any applicable state laws as they relate to any prepayment restrictions contained in this Paragraph 9 or otherwise contained in this Note and expressly acknowledges that Holder has made the Loan in reliance upon such agreements and waiver of Maker and that Holder would not have made the Loan without such agreements and waiver of Maker.  Maker acknowledges that specific weight has been given to the consideration given for such agreements, which consideration is the granting of the Loan. 
    
  10.      Evasion of Prepayment Premium       Maker acknowledges that in the event of an acceleration of payment of this Note following an Event of Default by Maker, a tender of payment of an amount necessary to satisfy the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby, but not including the Prepayment Premium, made at any time by Maker, its successors or assigns or by anyone on behalf of Maker, shall be presumed to be and conclusively deemed to constitute a deliberate evasion of the prepayment provisions hereof and shall constitute a prepayment hereunder and shall therefore be subject to the Prepayment Premium as calculated in accordance with this Note with the date of prepayment being deemed the date of occurrence of the foreclosure sale or the tender of payment of the amount necessary to pay the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby in full, including the Prepayment Premium. 
    
  11.      Maker's Covenants       Maker agrees that: 
    
  (a)    this instrument and the rights and obligations of all parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located; 
    
  (b)    the obligation evidenced by this Note is an exempted transaction under the Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.  1601,   et     seq.  (1982); 
    
  (c)    said obligation constitutes a business loan for the purpose of the application of any laws that distinguish between consumer loans and business loans and that have as their purpose the protection of consumers in the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located; 
    
  (d)    at the option of the Holder, the United States District Court for the district in which the Property is located and any court of competent jurisdiction of the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located shall have jurisdiction in any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to any act taken or omitted hereunder or the enforcement of this Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements and Maker shall not assert in any such action, suit or other proceeding that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of the action, suit or other proceeding is improper; 
    
  (e)    it hereby waives any objections to venue; and 
    
  (f)    it hereby waives its right to a trial by jury. 
    
  12.      Severability       The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision of this Note comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions.  However, if any provision or any portion of any provision contained in this Note is held by a court of law to be invalid, illegal, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written in any respect, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that such portion or provision shall be given force to the fullest possible extent that it is legal, valid and enforceable, that the remainder of the Note shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion or provision was not contained therein, and the rights, obligations and interests of Maker and Holder under the remainder of this Note shall continue in full force and effect. 
    
  13.      Usury Laws     It is the intention of Maker and Holder to conform strictly to the usury laws now or hereafter in force in the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located, and any interest payable under this Note, the Deed of Trust, or any Related Agreement shall be subject to reduction to an amount not to exceed the maximum non-usurious amount for commercial loans allowed under the usury laws of the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located as now or hereafter construed by the courts having jurisdiction over such matters.  In the event such interest (whether designated as interest, service charges, points, or otherwise) does exceed the maximum legal rate, it shall be 
    
  (a)    canceled automatically to the extent that such interest exceeds the maximum legal rate; 
    
  (b)    if already paid, at the option of the Holder, either be rebated to Maker or credited on the principal amount of the Note; or 
    
  (c)    if the Note has been prepaid in full, then such excess shall be rebated to Maker. 
    
  14.      Acceleration     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Holder shall have the right, without demand or notice, to declare the entire principal amount of the Note and/or any Future Advance (as defined in the Deed of Trust) then outstanding, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other sums payable under the Note, which shall include the Prepayment Premium (calculated as provided for in Paragraph 9 hereinabove), the Deed of Trust or any note evidencing any Future Advance, to be immediately due and payable and, notwithstanding the stated maturity in the Note or any note evidencing any Future Advance, all such sums declared due and payable shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.  During the existence of such Event of Default, Holder may apply payments received on any amounts due under the Note, the Deed of Trust, any Related Agreement or any note evidencing any Future Advance as Holder may determine in its sole discretion. 
    
  15.      Waivers by Maker       As to this Note, the Deed of Trust, the Related Agreements and any other instruments securing the indebtedness, Maker and all guarantors, sureties and endorsers, severally waive all applicable exemption rights, whether under any state constitution, homestead laws or otherwise, and also severally waive diligence, valuation and appraisement, presentment for payment, protest and demand, notice of protest, demand and dishonor and diligence in collection and nonpayment of this Note and, to the extent permitted by law, all other notices in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default, or enforcement of the payment of this Note (except notice of default specifically provided for in the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements).  To the extent permitted by law, Maker further waives all benefit that might accrue to Maker by virtue of any present or future laws exempting the Property, or any other property, real or personal, or the proceeds arising from any sale of any such property, from attachment, levy, or sale under execution, or providing for any stay of execution to be issued on any judgment recovered on this Note or in any action to foreclose the Deed of Trust, injunction against sale pursuant to power of sale, exemption from civil process or extension of time for payment.  Maker agrees that any real estate that may be levied upon pursuant to a judgment obtained by virtue of this Note, or any writ of execution issued thereon, may be sold upon any such writ in whole or in part in any order desired by Holder. 
    
  16.      Maker Not Released     No delay or omission of Holder to exercise any of its rights and remedies under the Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreements at any time following the happening of an Event of Default shall constitute a waiver of the right of Holder to exercise such rights and remedies at a later time by reason of such Event of Default or by reason of any subsequently occurring Event of Default.  The acceptance by Holder of payment of any sum payable hereunder after the due date of such payment shall not be a waiver of Holder s right to either require prompt payment when due of all other sums payable hereunder or to declare a default for failure to make prompt payment. This Note, or any payment hereunder, may be extended from time to time by agreement in writing between Maker and Holder without in any other way affecting the liability and obligations of Maker and endorsers, if any. 
    
  17.      Nonrecourse     Except as otherwise set forth in this section, Holder's recourse under the Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements shall be limited to and satisfied from the Property and the proceeds thereof, the rents and all other income arising therefrom, the other assets of Maker arising out of the Property which are given as collateral for the Loan, and any other collateral given in writing to Holder as security for repayment of the Loan (all of the foregoing are collectively referred to as the ("  Loan Collateral  ").  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence: 
    
  (a)    Holder may, in accordance with the terms of the Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreement:  (i)  foreclose the lien and security title of the Deed of Trust, (ii) take appropriate action to enforce this Note, the Deed of Trust and any Related Agreements to realize upon and/or protect the Loan Collateral, (iii) name Maker as a party defendant in any action brought under this Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreement so long as the exercise of any remedy is limited to the Loan Collateral, (iv) pursue all of its rights and remedies against any guarantor i  ncluding any guarantor of the Loan   or any surety or master tenant, whether or not such guarantor or surety or master tenant is a partner, member or other owner of Maker, and (v) pursue all of its rights and remedies against Maker and the indemnitors under that certain Environmental Indemnity Agreement of even date herewith; 
    
  (b)    Holder may seek damages or other monetary relief to the extent of actual monetary loss, or any other remedy at law or in equity (provided that the monetary relief shall remain limited to Holder s actual monetary losses, including Holder s costs and expenses in pursuing equitable remedies as set forth in the Deed of Trust, for example, quiet title actions, injunctive relief to prevent waste, and defense of claims alleging invalidity of title or enforceability of the Loan Documents) against Maker and the indemnitors/guarantors (the "  Nonrecourse Exception Guarantor(s)  ") under that certain Nonrecourse Exception Indemnity and Guaranty Agreement of even date herewith (the    Nonrecourse Exception Indemnity Agreement   ) by reason of or in connection with:  (i)  the failure of Maker to pay to Holder, upon demand, all rents, issues and profits of the Property to which Holder is entitled pursuant to this Note, the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements following an Event of Default,  (ii)  any waste of the Property or any willful act or omission by Maker which damages or materially reduces the value of the Property,  (iii)  the failure to apply all rents, issues and profits from the Property to the payment of operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance, lender-required capital repair items, property management fees and the payment of sums due and owing under this Note, the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements prior to any other expenditure or distribution by Maker,  (iv)  the failure to account for and to turn over security deposits (and interest required by law or agreement to be paid thereon) or prepaid rents   or lease termination payments   following the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreements that has not been cured in the applicable cure period, (v)  the failure to timely pay real estate taxes or any regular or special assessments affecting the Property,  except to the extent sufficient funds are in the real estate tax escrow to pay taxes in full when due, (vi)  the failure to account for and to turn over real estate tax accruals, if any, following the occurrence of a default under this Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreements,  (vii)  the failure to maintain casualty and liability insurance as required under the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements or to apply insurance proceeds or condemnation awards relating to the Property or other Loan Collateral in the manner required under applicable provisions of this Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreements,  (viii)  any modification, termination or cancellation of any lease of all or any portion of the Property without Holder's prior written consent, if and to the extent such consent is required under the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements and if and to the extent such modification, termination or cancellation has a material adverse effect on the value of the Property,  (ix)  an uncured default by Maker under any Lease of all or any portion of the Property,  or  (x) failure to pay costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorney s fees and transfer taxes, incurred by Holder in connection with the enforcement of this Note, the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure; and 
    
  (c)    Maker and the Nonrecourse Exception Guarantor(s) shall be personally liable for payment of the entire indebtedness evidenced by this Note and the costs of performing all other obligations of Maker under this Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements (   Full Recourse Obligations   ) only in the event that one of the following occurs:  (i)  fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact made by Maker or the Nonrecourse Exception Guarantor(s) in connection with this Note, the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements or any request for any action or consent by Holder under the Loan Documents,  (ii)  a Transfer of any interest in the Maker or all or any portion of the Property or any interest therein in violation of the terms of this Note, the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements,   (iii) the incurrence by Maker of any indebtedness in violation of the terms of the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreement (whether secured or unsecured, direct or contingent), other than unsecured debt or routine trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with the operation of the Property, (iv) any attempt by Maker to delay or enjoin the enforcement of any remedies provided to Lender under the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreement, raise defenses or counterclaims in connection with any such enforcement action, or otherwise object to any actions taken by Holder to exercise any remedies under this Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreement,  (v) if any petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement pursuant to federal bankruptcy law or any similar federal or state law,  shall be filed by, consented to, or acquiesced in by Maker or any Nonrecourse Exception Guarantor(s),  or (vi)  any action is taken by Maker, any general partner of Maker, or any Nonrecourse Exception Guarantor(s) to oppose any motion by Holder for relief from the automatic stay in connection with any bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement filed by, consented to, or acquiesced by Maker.  
    
  In addition, Maker and the Nonrecourse Exception Guarantor(s) shall be responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by Holder in connection with the collection of any amounts for which Maker and the Nonrecourse Exception  Guarantor(s) are personally liable under this section, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs, filing fees, and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. 
    
  18.      Successors and Assigns     The provisions of this Note shall be binding upon Maker and its legal representatives, successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of any Holder and its successors and assigns.  In the event Maker is composed of more than one party, obligations arising from this Note are and shall be joint and several as to each such party. 
    
  19.      Remedies Cumulative     The remedies of Holder as provided in this Note, or in the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements, and the warranties contained herein or therein shall be cumulative and concurrent, may be pursued singly, successively or together at the sole discretion of Holder, may be exercised as often as occasion for their exercise shall occur and in no event shall the failure to exercise any such right or remedy be construed as a waiver or release of such right or remedy.  No remedy under this Note, conferred upon or reserved to Holder is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy provided in this Note, the Deed of Trust or the Related Agreements or provided by law, but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under the Deed of Trust or any of the Related Agreements or hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

  21.      No Oral Modification     This Note may not be modified or discharged orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, modification or discharge is sought. 
    
  22.      Time     Time is of the essence with regard to the performance of the obligations of Maker in this Note and each and every term, covenant and condition herein by or applicable to Maker. 
    
  23.      Captions     The captions and headings of the paragraphs of this Note are for convenience only and are not to be used to interpret, define or limit the provisions hereof. 
    
  24.      Transfer of Note     Holder may, at any time without notice: (i) sell, transfer or assign this Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements, and any or all servicing rights with respect to this Note, or (ii) grant participations in this Note or (iii) issue mortgage pass-through certificates or other securities (   Securitizations   ) evidencing a beneficial interest in this Note.  In connection with any such sale, transfer, or assignment, Holder shall have the right from time to time to sever this Note (and any other note(s) evidencing this Loan) into one or more separate promissory notes in such denominations as Holder determines in its sole discretion, which promissory notes may be included in separate sales or Securitizations undertaken by Holder.  In conjunction with any such action, Holder may redefine the Contract Rate and amortization schedule; provided, however, (a) if Holder redefines the Contract Rate, the initial weighted average of the interest rates contained in the severed promissory notes taken in the aggregate shall equal the Contract Rate, and (b) if Holder redefines the amortization schedule, the amortization of the severed promissory notes taken in the aggregate shall require no more amortization to be paid under such severed notes as was required under this Note, initially executed and delivered by Maker.  Subject to the foregoing, each severed promissory note, and the Loan evidenced thereby, shall be upon all of the terms and provisions contained in this Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements, and Maker shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of Holder to accomplish the foregoing, including, without limitation, execution and prompt delivery to Holder of a severance agreement and such other documents as Holder shall reasonably require.  Maker hereby appoints Holder its attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (which shall be deemed coupled with an interest and irrevocable until the Loan is paid in full and the Deed of Trust is discharged of record) to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance; provided, however, Holder shall not make or execute any such documents under such power until five days after written notice has been given to Maker by Holder of Holder s intent to exercise its rights under such power. Maker s failure to deliver any of the documents requested by Holder hereunder within such five day period after such notice by Holder shall, at Holder s option, constitute an Event of Default hereunder if Holder cannot make or execute such documents pursuant to the power of attorney granted herein.  Holder may forward to any prospective purchaser or any rating agency all documents and information Holder now has or may acquire, as Holder determines necessary or desirable, including, without limitation, financial information regarding Maker, its general partners, shareholders, members or other principals. 
    
  25.      Replacement Note     Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Maker of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to Maker or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Note, Maker will execute and deliver to Holder in lieu thereof, a replacement note dated as of the date of this Note, identical in form and substance to this Note and upon such execution and delivery all references in the Deed of Trust to this Note shall be deemed to refer to such replacement note.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Maker has caused this Promissory Note to be duly executed under seal on the date first above written.

  PROMISSORY NOTE 
    
  $40,200,000.00                                April 14, 2016 

1.      Payment of Principal and Interest     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, RRE FOX RIDGE HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "  Maker  "), hereby promises to pay to the order of ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, an Illinois insurance company, and any subsequent holder of this Note ("  Holder  " or "  Holders  ") in the manner hereinafter provided, the principal amount of FORTY MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($40,200,000.00) together with interest on the outstanding principal balance from the date of the initial disbursement (for purposes of this Note, "disbursement" means the date funds are wire transferred from Holder's account) of all or a part of the principal of this Note ("  Disbursement Date  ") until maturity at the rate of three and eighty-nine hundredths percent  (3.89%) per annum ("  Contract Rate  ") as follows: 
    
  (a)    on the Disbursement Date, interest only, in advance, accruing from the Disbursement Date to the last day of April, 2016, both inclusive; and thereafter 
    
  (b)    interest only, in arrears, in consecutive equal installments of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN and NO/100ths DOLLARS ($  130,315.00  ) on the first day of June, 2016 and on the first day of each month thereafter until May 1, 2019, both inclusive (the    I/O Period    and thereafter 
  (c)      in arrears, on the first day of June, 2019 and on the first day of each month thereafter until this Note matures, principal and interest in consecutive equal installments of ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY and 38/100ths DOLLARS ($  189,380.38  ), which amount is calculated using an amortization period of three hundred sixty (360) months (the payments described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 1 shall each hereinafter be referred to as "  Monthly Payment  "); and 
  (d)    on May 1, 2023 (the "  Maturity Date  "), the entire unpaid principal amount and any interest accrued but remaining unpaid and all other sums due under this Note. 
    
  Except for the interest payable under paragraph (a) above, interest shall be payable in arrears and calculated on the basis of a 360 day year containing twelve 30 day months.  All such payments on account of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall be first applied to interest accrued on the unpaid principal amount and the remainder toward reduction of the unpaid principal amount. 
    
  2.      Payment Information     All payments required to be made hereunder shall be made during regular business hours to Holder at its office, c/o Allstate Investments, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Division, Allstate Plaza South, Suite G5C, 3075 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois  60062, Attention: Servicing Manager, with sufficient information to identify the source and application of such payment to Holder's Loan No. 123565, or at such other place as Holder may from time to time designate in writing.  All payments shall be made in currency of United States of America without presentment or surrender of this Note.  Payments to Holder shall be made by transferring immediately available federal funds by bank wire or interbank transfer for the account of Holder.  Any payment of principal or interest received after 1:00 p.m., Chicago time, shall be deemed to have been received by Holder on the next business day and shall bear interest accordingly.  If and so long as Holder directs Maker to make payments to a servicing agent, then payments may be made by check.  Payments made by check will not be deemed made until good funds for such check are received by Holder or the servicing agent. 
    
  3.      Security For Note    The payment of the Note and all other sums due Holder is secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Contracts, Security Agreement, and Fixture Filing ("  Deed of Trust  "), of even date herewith, granted by Maker to the Public Trustee of Arapahoe County, Colorado, as trustee, for the benefit of Holder, covering certain real property, the improvements thereon and certain personal property situated in the County of Arapahoe, State of Colorado and described in the Deed of Trust ("  Property  "), and those certain instruments of indebtedness and security described as "Related Agreements" in the Deed of Trust.  Except as otherwise defined herein, all of the defined terms contained in the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements are hereby incorporated herein by express reference. 
    
  4.      Late Charges       If any Monthly Payment required under the Note is not paid in full on or before the fourth day after such payment is due, Maker acknowledges that the Holder will incur extra expenses for the handling of the delinquent payment and servicing the indebtedness evidenced hereby, and that the exact amount of these extra expenses is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain, but that a charge of five percent (5%) of the amount of the delinquent payment ("  Late Charge  ") would be a fair approximation of the expense so incurred by Holder.  If applicable law requires a lesser charge, however, then the maximum charge permitted by such law may be charged by Holder for said purpose.  Therefore, Maker shall, in such event, without further notice, and without prejudice to the right of Holder to collect any other amounts provided to be paid hereunder or under the Deed of Trust, the Related Agreements or any other instrument executed for purposes of further securing payment of the obligations evidenced by this Note, or to declare an Event of Default as defined below, pay to Holder immediately upon demand the Late Charge to compensate Holder for expenses incurred in handling delinquent payments. 
    
  5.      Interest Payable Upon Default     If there occurs an Event of Default, under the Note or the Deed of Trust or under any Related Agreement, then the unpaid principal amount of the Note, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest at the Contract Rate plus five percent (5%) per annum compounded monthly ("  Default Rate  ") from the date of expiration of any applicable cure or grace period until such time, if any, as the Event of Default is cured and the Deed of Trust and the Note are reinstated as permitted by applicable law, or otherwise until such time as the unpaid principal amount of the Note and all other indebtedness evidenced by the Note are fully repaid, whichever is earlier. 
    
  6.      Events of Default     An "Event of Default" shall exist under this Note: 
    
  (a)    in the event Maker shall fail to make any payment due under the Note, other than the final payment and Prepayment Premium (as defined herein), on or before the fourth day after such payment is due; 
    
  (b)    in the event Maker shall fail to make the final payment or the Prepayment Premium when such payment is due; or 
    
  (c)    [intentionally omitted]; or 
    
  (d)    if there shall exist an Event of Default under the Deed of Trust or any of the Related Agreements. 
    
  7.      Additional Payments     The additional payments called for under Paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be in addition to, and shall in no way limit, any other rights and remedies provided for in the Note, the Deed of Trust, any Related Agreements, or otherwise provided by law. 
    
  8.      Payment of Taxes and Expenses 
    
  (a)    Maker further promises to pay to Holder, immediately upon written notice from Holder:  (i)  all recordation, transfer, stamp, documentary or other fees or taxes levied on Holder (exclusive of Holder's income taxes) by reason of the making or recording of this Note, the Deed of Trust or any of the Related Agreements, and  (ii)  all intangible property taxes levied upon any Holder of this Note or mortgagee under the Deed of Trust or secured party under the Related Agreements. 
    
  (b)    Maker further promises to pay to Holder, immediately upon written notice from Holder, all actual costs, expenses, disbursements, escrow fees, title charges and reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Holder and its counsel in connection with:  (i)  the collection, attempted collection, or negotiation and documentation of any settlement or workout of any payment due hereunder, and  (ii)  any suit or proceeding whatsoever in regard to this Note or the protection or enforcement of the lien of any instrument securing this Note, including, without limitation, in any bankruptcy proceeding or judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceeding.  It is the intent of the parties that Maker pay all expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Holder as a result of Holder's entering into the loan transaction evidenced by this Note. 
    
  9.      Prepayment     (a) Maker is prohibited from prepaying this Note until May 1, 2018 (the "  No-Prepayment Period  ").  Subsequent to the No-Prepayment Period until May 1, 2019, at any time with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Holder, specifying the date of prepayment, Maker will have the privilege of prepaying the outstanding principal amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest, any other sums secured by the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements, and a prepayment premium ("  Prepayment Premium  ") equal to the greater of: 
    
  (a)  one percent (1%) of the principal amount prepaid, or 
    
  (b)  the yield maintenance payment calculated as follows: 
    
  If the Prevailing Interest Rate is less than the Contract Rate, the yield maintenance payment shall be the remainder of  (x) minus  (y)  where  "(x)"  is the present value of all unpaid installments of principal and interest due under this Note from the date of prepayment to and including the original maturity date of this Note, discounted at the Prevailing Interest Rate, and  "(y)"  is the outstanding principal balance of this Note as of the prepayment date.  The term "Prevailing Interest Rate" as used herein shall mean the yield to maturity on a United States Treasury Bond or Treasury Note, without call options,  selected by Holder having a maturity date as near as possible to the original maturity date of this Note and an "ask" price, as close as possible to par as published two weeks prior to the specified date of prepayment in   The Wall Street Journal   (including WSJ.com or other similar on-line versions thereof) or in another similar publication of comparable reliability and institutional acceptance  or available from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( Current Yield ), less the Basis Point Adjustment as computed in accordance with   Exhibit A   attached hereto to convert the monthly payments to a semi-annual equivalent. 
    
  Subsequent to May 1, 2019 until May 1, 2022, at any time with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Holder, specifying the date of prepayment, Maker shall have the privilege of prepaying the outstanding principal amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest, any other sums secured by the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements a Prepayment Premium equal to one percent (1%) of the principal amount prepaid.  No Prepayment Premium shall be due on the principal balance prepaid within the twelve (12) month period prior to the original Maturity Date of this Note.   
    
  (c)    Written notice of Maker's election to make a prepayment in full of this Note shall be given in the manner provided for notices under the Deed of Trust.  Partial prepayment of the outstanding principal amount of this Note shall not be permitted except in accordance with the terms of the Deed of Trust.  In the event of such a permitted partial prepayment, if any, the Prepayment Premium calculated in this Paragraph 9 shall be due, such Prepayment Premium shall be prorated based on the amount of the partial prepayment relative to the then current outstanding principal balance of this Note. 
    
  (d)    Maker acknowledges that Holder: 
    
           (i) 
    has advanced the amounts evidenced by this Note with the expectation that such amounts would be outstanding for a period at least equal to the No-Prepayment Period; 
       
           (ii) 
    would not have been willing to advance such amounts on these terms for a shorter period of time; 
       
           (iii) 
    in making the Loan evidenced by this Note, is relying on Maker's creditworthiness and its agreement to pay in strict accordance with the terms set forth in the Note; and 
       
           (iv) 
    would not make the Loan without full and complete assurance by Maker of its agreement not to prepay all or a part of the principal of this Note except as expressly permitted herein and in the Deed of Trust.  Maker has been advised and acknowledges that Holder is relying on the receipt of payments under this Note to, among other things, match and support its obligations under contracts entered into by Holder with third parties and that in the event of a prepayment, Holder could suffer loss and additional expenses which are extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain.  Accordingly, it is the express intent of Maker and Holder that  (A)  Maker shall have no right to prepay this Note during the No-Prepayment Period,  (B)  any prepayment of this Note during the No-Prepayment Period shall only occur in the event Holder accelerates payment under this Note or as otherwise permitted by or required under the Deed of Trust, (C)  any prepayment described in the foregoing clause (D) shall (unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Deed of Trust) require the payment of a Prepayment Premium calculated as provided for hereinabove; and  (E)  to the extent permitted by applicable law, Maker has waived, and hereby waives, any right to prepay this Note except as expressly provided in the Deed of Trust or this Note.  In the event, notwithstanding the foregoing express intent of Maker and Holder and the express waiver by Maker of any right to prepay this Note, that the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located permits the Maker to prepay this Note during the No-Prepayment Period, then the Prepayment Premium described in clause (C) above shall be paid to Holder as a condition to any such prepayment. 
       
  (e)    Maker expressly acknowledges that, pursuant to the provisions of this Note and except as otherwise provided in this Note or the Deed of Trust, Maker has no right to prepay this Note in whole or in part.  In the event any prepayment is required or expressly permitted, Maker shall be liable for the payment of the Prepayment Premium unless expressly stated otherwise herein or in the Deed of Trust.  Furthermore, Maker waives any rights it may have under any applicable state laws as they relate to any prepayment restrictions contained in this Paragraph 9 or otherwise contained in this Note and expressly acknowledges that Holder has made the Loan in reliance upon such agreements and waiver of Maker and that Holder would not have made the Loan without such agreements and waiver of Maker.  Maker acknowledges that specific weight has been given to the consideration given for such agreements, which consideration is the granting of the Loan. 
    
  10.      Evasion of Prepayment Premium       Maker acknowledges that in the event of an acceleration of payment of this Note following an Event of Default by Maker, a tender of payment of an amount necessary to satisfy the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby, but not including the Prepayment Premium, made at any time by Maker, its successors or assigns or by anyone on behalf of Maker, shall be presumed to be and conclusively deemed to constitute a deliberate evasion of the prepayment provisions hereof and shall constitute a prepayment hereunder and shall therefore be subject to the Prepayment Premium as calculated in accordance with this Note with the date of prepayment being deemed the date of occurrence of the foreclosure sale or the tender of payment of the amount necessary to pay the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby in full, including the Prepayment Premium. 
    
  11.      Maker's Covenants       Maker agrees that: 
    
  (a)    this instrument and the rights and obligations of all parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located; 
    
  (b)    the obligation evidenced by this Note is an exempted transaction under the Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.  1601,   et     seq.  (1982); 
    
  (c)    said obligation constitutes a business loan for the purpose of the application of any laws that distinguish between consumer loans and business loans and that have as their purpose the protection of consumers in the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located; 
    
  (d)    at the option of the Holder, the United States District Court for the district in which the Property is located and any court of competent jurisdiction of the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located shall have jurisdiction in any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to any act taken or omitted hereunder or the enforcement of this Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements and Maker shall not assert in any such action, suit or other proceeding that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of the action, suit or other proceeding is improper; 
    
  (e)    it hereby waives any objections to venue; and 
    
  (f)    it hereby waives its right to a trial by jury. 
    
  12.      Severability       The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision of this Note comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions.  However, if any provision or any portion of any provision contained in this Note is held by a court of law to be invalid, illegal, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written in any respect, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that such portion or provision shall be given force to the fullest possible extent that it is legal, valid and enforceable, that the remainder of the Note shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion or provision was not contained therein, and the rights, obligations and interests of Maker and Holder under the remainder of this Note shall continue in full force and effect. 
    
  13.      Usury Laws     It is the intention of Maker and Holder to conform strictly to the usury laws now or hereafter in force in the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located, and any interest payable under this Note, the Deed of Trust, or any Related Agreement shall be subject to reduction to an amount not to exceed the maximum non-usurious amount for commercial loans allowed under the usury laws of the state or commonwealth in which the Property is located as now or hereafter construed by the courts having jurisdiction over such matters.  In the event such interest (whether designated as interest, service charges, points, or otherwise) does exceed the maximum legal rate, it shall be 
    
  (a)    canceled automatically to the extent that such interest exceeds the maximum legal rate; 
    
  (b)    if already paid, at the option of the Holder, either be rebated to Maker or credited on the principal amount of the Note; or 
    
  (c)    if the Note has been prepaid in full, then such excess shall be rebated to Maker. 
    
  14.      Acceleration     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Holder shall have the right, without demand or notice, to declare the entire principal amount of the Note and/or any Future Advance (as defined in the Deed of Trust) then outstanding, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other sums payable under the Note, which shall include the Prepayment Premium (calculated as provided for in Paragraph 9 hereinabove), the Deed of Trust or any note evidencing any Future Advance, to be immediately due and payable and, notwithstanding the stated maturity in the Note or any note evidencing any Future Advance, all such sums declared due and payable shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.  During the existence of such Event of Default, Holder may apply payments received on any amounts due under the Note, the Deed of Trust, any Related Agreement or any note evidencing any Future Advance as Holder may determine in its sole discretion. 
    
  15.      Waivers by Maker       As to this Note, the Deed of Trust, the Related Agreements and any other instruments securing the indebtedness, Maker and all guarantors, sureties and endorsers, severally waive all applicable exemption rights, whether under any state constitution, homestead laws or otherwise, and also severally waive diligence, valuation and appraisement, presentment for payment, protest and demand, notice of protest, demand and dishonor and diligence in collection and nonpayment of this Note and, to the extent permitted by law, all other notices in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default, or enforcement of the payment of this Note (except notice of default specifically provided for in the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements).  To the extent permitted by law, Maker further waives all benefit that might accrue to Maker by virtue of any present or future laws exempting the Property, or any other property, real or personal, or the proceeds arising from any sale of any such property, from attachment, levy, or sale under execution, or providing for any stay of execution to be issued on any judgment recovered on this Note or in any action to foreclose the Deed of Trust, injunction against sale pursuant to power of sale, exemption from civil process or extension of time for payment.  Maker agrees that any real estate that may be levied upon pursuant to a judgment obtained by virtue of this Note, or any writ of execution issued thereon, may be sold upon any such writ in whole or in part in any order desired by Holder. 
    
  16.      Maker Not Released     No delay or omission of Holder to exercise any of its rights and remedies under the Note, the Deed of Trust or any Related Agreements at any time following the happening of an Event of Default shall constitute a waiver of the right of Holder to exercise such rights and remedies at a later time by reason of such Event of Default or by reason of any subsequently occurring Event of Default.  The acceptance by Holder of payment of any sum payable hereunder after the due date of such payment shall not be a waiver of Holder s right to either require prompt payment when due of all other sums payable hereunder or to declare a default for failure to make prompt payment. This Note, or any payment hereunder, may be extended from time to time by agreement in writing between Maker and Holder without in any other way affecting the liability and obligations of Maker and endorsers, if any. 
    
  17.      Nonrecourse     Except as otherwise set forth in this section, Holder's recourse under the Note, the Deed of Trust and the Related Agreements shall be limited to and satisfied from the Property and the proceeds thereof, the rents and all other income arising therefrom, the other assets of Maker arising out of the Property which are given as collateral for the Loan, and any other collateral given in writing to Holder as security for repayment of the Loan (all of the foregoing are collectively referred to as the ("  Loan Collateral  ").  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence:

In connection with any such sale, transfer, or assignment, Holder shall have the right from time to time to sever this Note (and any other note(s) evidencing this Loan) into one or more separate promissory notes in such denominations as Holder determines in its sole discretion, which promissory notes may be included in separate sales or Securitizations undertaken by Holder.

Maker s failure to deliver any of the documents requested by Holder hereunder within such five day period after such notice by Holder shall, at Holder s option, constitute an Event of Default hereunder if Holder cannot make or execute such documents pursuant to the power of attorney granted herein.

  (b)        Purchaser shall have until the expiration of the Due Diligence Period to conduct its Due Diligence and, in Purchaser's sole discretion, to determine whether the Property is acceptable to Purchaser.  Purchaser may, for any or no reason, terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to Seller on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period.  If Purchaser does not timely give notice of termination as aforesaid, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the condition precedent set forth in this   Section 3.2(b)   shall be deemed satisfied and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  In the event Purchaser s written notice to Seller under this   Section 3.2(b)   indicates that Purchaser will not proceed with the purchase of the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate, the Refundable Portion shall be returned to Purchaser and the balance of the Non-Refundable Portion being held in escrow shall be disbursed to Seller and neither party shall have any further obligations to the other party hereunder, except for the Surviving Obligations; provided, however, the entire Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser in the event Purchaser terminates this Agreement in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) as a result of (i) a material or adverse environmental matter disclosed in the Updated Phase I that was not disclosed in the Seller s Phase I, (ii) any material adverse matter revealed by the Amended Survey not shown on the Existing survey, or (iii) Buyer s zoning report on the Property determines that the current unit density of the Property is not permitted pursuant to applicable zoning laws (each a    Refundable Condition   ).

If Purchaser does not timely give notice requesting termination of a Service Contract, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the assumption of such Service Contract.  Purchaser shall assume all other Service Contracts listed on   Schedule 2   (other than the excluded service agreements).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no obligation to assume any Service Contract that is not assignable without the other party s consent where such consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing Date. 
  (d)        Purchaser shall have the right to conduct, at its sole cost and expense, any inspections, studies or tests that Purchaser deems appropriate in determining the condition of the Property, including obtaining an updated Phase I environmental report (the    Updated Phase I   ), provided, however, Purchaser is not permitted to perform any sampling, boring, drilling or other physically intrusive testing into the structures or ground comprising the Property, including, without limitation, a Phase II environmental assessment, without (i) submitting to Seller the scope and specifications for such testing; and (ii) obtaining the prior written consent of Seller for such testing, which consent may be withheld in Seller s sole and absolute discretion. 
  (e)        Prior to Closing, Purchaser agrees and covenants with Seller not to disclose to any third party (other than lenders, accountants, attorneys and other professionals and consultants in connection with the transaction contemplated herein) without Seller's prior written consent, unless Purchaser is obligated by law to make such disclosure, any of the reports or any other documentation or information obtained by Purchaser which relates to the Property or Seller in any way, all of which shall be used by Purchaser and its agents solely in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby.  In the event that this Agreement is terminated, Purchaser agrees that all such information will continue to be held in strict confidence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser s indemnification obligations under this Section 3.2(f) shall not extend to any preexisting conditions merely found to exist by Purchaser or any condition caused by any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Parties.  In the event that the Property is disturbed or altered in any way as a result of such activities, Purchaser shall promptly restore the Property to substantially the same condition existing prior to the commencement of such activities which disturbed or altered the Property.  Furthermore, Purchaser agrees to maintain and cause any of its representatives or agents conducting any Due Diligence to maintain and have in effect commercial general liability insurance with (i) limits of not less than Two Million and 00/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence for personal injury, including bodily injury and death, and property damage, (ii) Holland Breckenridge Apartment Homes, LLC, Holland 191 II, LLC, Holland Partner Group Management, Inc. and Heitman Capital Management, LLC named as additional insured parties, and (iii) waiver of subrogation.

  (h)        Sections 3.2(e) and 3.2(f)   and such other provisions in this Agreement designated as expressly surviving the termination hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement (collectively, the "  Surviving Obligations  "). 
  3.3        Title and Survey  .  Seller has, at Seller s sole cost and expense, obtained and delivered to Purchaser for Purchaser's review a commitment for an ALTA owner's policy of title insurance along with a copy of each instrument listed as an exception thereon (the "  Title Commitment  ") on the Real Property issued by the Title Company and the Existing Survey.  During the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser shall have the right to obtain, at its sole cost and expense, any desired endorsements to the Title Commitment which are available.  Seller has, at Purchaser s cost and expense, obtained and delivered to Purchaser for Purchaser s review the Amended Survey.  Purchaser shall have until the date which is two (2) business days prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (such date being referred to as the "  Title Review Date  ") for examination of Title Commitment, the Existing Survey and the Amended Survey and the making of any objections thereto, said objections to be made in writing and delivered to Seller on or before the Title Review Date.  If Purchaser shall fail to make any objections on or before the Title Review Date, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted all exceptions to the Title Commitment and the form and substance of the Existing Survey and the Amended Survey and all matters shown thereon; all such exceptions and matters and any exceptions or matters caused by or through Purchaser shall be included in the term "Permitted Exceptions" as used herein.  If Purchaser makes any objections to the Title Commitment, the Existing Survey or the Amended Survey on or before the Title Review Date, then Seller shall have until the second (2   nd   ) business day after the Title Review Date to notify Purchase in writing if it agrees to cure (by removal, endorsement or otherwise) such objections on or before the Closing Date.  If no such notice from Seller concerning such election is received by Purchaser by such date, then Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to cure any such objections.  If Seller is unable or unwilling to cure such objections, then Purchaser may as its only option, elect to either:  (y) waive such objection(s) and consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement without adjustment to the Purchase Price; or (z) within five (5) days of Seller s notice or failure to transmit a notice as noted in the preceding sentence, send Seller a written notice to terminate this Agreement (and failure of Purchaser to send such written notice shall constitute a waiver of such right to terminate), in which event the Refundable Portion shall be returned to Purchaser and the balance of the Non-Refundable Portion being held in escrow shall be disbursed to Seller and neither party shall have any further obligations to the other party except for the Surviving Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a condition to Closing Seller shall cause any and all mortgages and related documents executed by or through Seller encumbering the Property and any and all monetary liens on or against the Property to be removed (or, in the case of monetary liens other than the liens of Seller s mortgage financing, insured over by the Title Company) as of the Closing Date.

Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims and costs (including reasonable attorney fees, court costs and litigation expenses) which Purchaser received credits pursuant to this Section 5.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SELLER WILL SUFFER DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASER'S DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S LOSS IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASER'S DEFAULT.  THUS, SELLER SHALL ACCEPT AND RETAIN THE EARNEST MONEY AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES BUT NOT AS A PENALTY.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS   SECTION 17.5  , SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SHALL CONSTITUTE SELLER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

  20.        Rule 3-14 Compliance  .  Seller shall from the date of this Agreement on or up to forty-five days after Closing provide to Purchaser (at Purchaser s expense) copies of, or shall provide Purchaser reasonable access to, such factual information as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, and in the possession or control of Seller, or its property manager or accountants, necessary to enable Purchaser's auditor to conduct an audit, in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X, of the income statements of the Property for the year to date of the year in which Closing occurs plus the one (1) immediately preceding calendar year.  Purchaser shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs associated with this audit.  Seller shall up to forty-five days after the Closing reasonably cooperate (at no cost to Seller) with Purchaser s auditor in the conduct of such audit, which will include responding to verbal requests for information regarding internal controls and follow-up questions on the financial information provided to the Purchaser.  In addition, on or up to forty-five days after Closing, Seller agrees to provide to Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser, if requested by such auditor, historical financial statements for the Property, including (without limitation) income and balance sheet data for the Property.  Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Purchaser or its designated independent or other auditor may audit Seller s operating statements of the Property, at Purchaser s expense, and Seller shall on or within forty-five (45) days of Closing provide such documentation as Purchaser or its auditor may reasonably request in order to complete such audit, and (ii) Seller shall on or before Closing furnish to Purchaser such financial and other information as may be reasonably required by Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser to make any required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other governmental authority.  Seller shall maintain its records for use under this   Section 20   for a period of not less than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section shall survive Closing for a period of ninety (90) days.  Seller s obligation to deliver to Purchaser its records for use under this   Section 20   shall be an ongoing condition to Closing for Purchaser s benefit until Closing.

  NON-FOREIGN AFFIDAVIT 
    
  Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person.    For U.S. tax purposes (including Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity.  Holland Breckenridge Apartment Homes, LLC, the owner of the property, is a disregarded entity.  Therefore, Holland 191 II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (   Transferor   ), is the owner for U.S. tax purposes.  T  o inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Transferor, the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of the Transferor: 
           1. 
    Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign estate, or foreign person (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and the Income Tax Regulations promulgated thereunder); 
     2.      Transferor is not a  disregarded entity as defined in IRS Regulation 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii). 
    Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by the transferee and that any false statement contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both. 
  Under penalties of perjury the undersigned declares that it has examined this certification and to the best of its knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete, and it further declares that it has authority to sign this document on behalf of Transferor.

If Purchaser does not so terminate this Agreement within three business days after expiration of the Response Period, Purchaser will be deemed to have waived the objection to the Noted Exception and the transaction shall proceed without reduction in the Purchase Price; provided that if Seller notified Purchaser during the Response Period that Seller would use commercially reasonable efforts to cure any Noted Exception, but Seller fails to cure such Noted Exception by the Closing Date, then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice given to Seller prior to Closing, in which case the entire Deposit, other than the Independent Consideration which shall be delivered to Seller, shall be returned by Title Company to Purchaser.  All title exceptions and survey matters existing as of the date of this Agreement to which Purchaser does not object by the end of the Due Diligence Period as provided above, any Noted Exceptions to which Purchaser objects but subsequently waives the objection, and any title exceptions arising after the end of the Due Diligence Period that are caused by Purchaser or to which Purchaser consents, are collectively called the    Permitted Exceptions  ;  provided that in no event shall any deed of trust or other security interest against the Property, any lien not caused by Purchaser which may be satisfied by the payment of money or any voluntary lien be a Permitted Exception, and Seller shall be obligated to cause all such deeds of trust, security interests and liens to be satisfied and released at or prior to Closing (collectively, the    Monetary Liens   ).  The Leases will be Permitted Exceptions, whether or not exceptions therefor are set forth in Schedule B of the Title Commitment.  After the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser may, prior to Closing, notify Seller in writing of any objection to any update to the Title Commitment or the Survey first arising after the date of the Survey (with respect to survey matters) or the Title Commitment (with respect to title matters) (each a    New Encumbrance   ) but not later than three business days after receipt of the update to the Title Commitment or Survey giving rise to such objection.  If Purchaser does not object to any New Encumbrance as herein provided, such New Encumbrance shall be deemed approved by Purchaser and shall become a Permitted Exception.  In the event that Purchaser gives written notice of objection to any New Encumbrance, Seller shall have the same obligation or options to cure (but shall make such election within three business days or receipt of written notice from Purchaser) and Purchaser shall have the same options to waive its objections or to terminate this Agreement, all as set forth above.

Seller shall execute at Closing an affidavit in customary form required by Title Company to delete the exceptions as to parties in possession, unrecorded liens, broker s liens and similar matters.  The Title Policy may be delivered after the Closing if, at the Closing, Title Company issues a currently effective, duly executed  marked-up  Title Commitment and irrevocably commits in writing to issue the Title Policy consistent with the  marked-up  Title Commitment promptly after the Closing Date.   
    
  3.4      Title and Survey Costs  .  The base premium for the Title Policy shall be paid by Seller as well as the cost of any release fees or endorsements related to Monetary Liens.
