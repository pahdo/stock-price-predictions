1  .   Basis of presentation 
  As used herein, the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our  means Toys  R  Us, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders  Deficit   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , have been prepared by us in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim reporting, and in accordance with the requirements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Our interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and are subject to year-end adjustments.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements include all known adjustments (which consist primarily of normal, recurring accruals, estimates and assumptions that impact the financial statements) necessary to present fairly the financial position at the balance sheet dates and the results of operations for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks then ended.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   January 30, 2016  , presented herein, has been derived from our audited balance sheet included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  , but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  .  The results of operations for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full year. 
  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ).  ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  Under the previous practice, debt issuance costs were recognized as an asset.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15  Interest - Imputed Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ), which clarifies that the guidance in ASU 2015-03 does not apply to line-of-credit arrangements.  The Company has retrospectively adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, effective January 31, 2016.  We revised the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs from Other assets to a deduction from the carrying amount of   Long-term debt   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and revised the presentation of the carrying amounts of individual debt liabilities in Note   2   entitled    Short-term borrowings and long-term debt  .   The amounts of debt issuance costs that were reclassified as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   totaled   $44 million  ,   $58 million   and   $80 million  , respectively. 
  Distribution to Noncontrolling Interest 
  During the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , Toys (Labuan) Holding Limited ( Asia JV ) made a   $40 million   distribution,   $28 million   of which was paid to our subsidiary and   $12 million   was paid to Asia JV s minority interest partner.

2  .   Short-term borrowings and long-term debt 
  A summary of the Company s consolidated Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   is outlined in the table below.  The balances below do not include the impact of the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ( CMBS ) and mezzanine financing and subsequent redemption of the Propco II Notes (as defined below) which were completed subsequent to   October 29, 2016  .

(5) 
    Represents obligations of Toys  R  Us Property Company II, LLC ( TRU Propco II ).  TRU Propco II is a single-purpose entity and is a separate entity from the Company.  The assets and credit of TRU Propco II and its direct parent   Giraffe Junior Holdings, LLC     ( Giraffe Junior )   are not available to satisfy the debts or other obligations of the Company or any affiliate. 
              (6) 
    On November 3, 2016, we completed   $512 million   of CMBS financing and   $88 million   of mezzanine financing.  The proceeds and a   $51 million   rent prepayment from   Toys  R  Us       Delaware, Inc. ( Toys-Delaware ) to TRU Propco II in conjunction with an amendment to the   master lease agreement, along with cash on hand were used to redeem the aggregate principal amount of   $725 million   of   8.500%   senior secured notes due 2017 of TRU Propco II (the  Propco II Notes ).  TRU Propco II entered into a mortgage loan agreement (the  Mortgage Loan Agreement ), providing for a floating-rate loan (the  Propco II Mortgage Loan ) in the initial principal amount of   $512 million  .    Additionally, Giraffe Junior, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the owner of   100%   of the equity interest in TRU Propco II, entered into a mezzanine loan agreement (the  Mezzanine Loan Agreement ) providing for a fixed-rate loan (the  Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan ) in the initial principal amount of   $88 million  .    The impact of these transactions is not reflected in the balances presented, as the transactions occurred after fiscal quarter-end.  For further details, refer to the    Subsequent Events    below.

              (10) 
    We may maintain derivative instruments on certain of our long-term debt.  Refer to Note 3 entitled  Derivative instruments and hedging activities  for further details. 
     The Parent Company is a holding company and conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which have incurred their own indebtedness.  Our credit facilities, loan agreements and indentures contain customary covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: 
             
    incur certain additional indebtedness; 
                
    transfer money between the Parent Company and our various subsidiaries; 
                
    pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions with respect to our or our subsidiaries  capital stock or make other restricted payments; 
                
    issue stock of subsidiaries; 
                
    make certain investments, loans or advances; 
                
    transfer and sell certain assets; 
                
    create or permit liens on assets; 
                
    consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; 
                
    enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and 
                
    amend certain documents. 
     The amount of total net assets that were subject to such restrictions was   $34 million   as of   October 29, 2016  .  Our agreements also contain various and customary events of default with respect to the indebtedness, including, without limitation, the failure to pay interest or principal when the same is due under the agreements, cross default and cross acceleration provisions, the failure of representations and warranties contained in the agreements to be true and certain insolvency events.  If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the principal amounts outstanding thereunder, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owed thereunder, may be declared immediately due and payable by the lenders. 
  We are dependent on the borrowings provided by the lenders to support our working capital needs, capital expenditures and to service debt.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we have funds available to finance our operations under our   $1.85 billion   secured revolving credit facility ( ABL Facility ) through   March 2019  , subject to an earlier springing maturity, our   two   Toys-Japan unsecured credit lines through   June 2017   and   June 2018   and our European and Australian asset-based revolving credit facility ( European ABL Facility ) through   December 2020  .  In addition, Asia JV and Toys-Japan have uncommitted lines of credit due on demand. 
  Asia JV uncommitted lines of credit, due on demand (  $7 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) 
  Asia JV has several uncommitted unsecured lines of credit with various financial institutions with total availability of HK  $274 million   (  $35 million   at   October 29, 2016  ).  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had   $7 million   of borrowings, which has been included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and   $5 million   of bank  
  
    8 

guarantees issued under these facilities.  The remaining availability under these facilities was   $23 million  .  The average interest rate on the drawn borrowings was   1.15%   and   1.55%   at   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Toys-Japan unsecured credit lines, expire fiscals 2017-2018 (  $8 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) 
  Toys-Japan currently has an agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which includes   two   unsecured loan commitment lines of credit,  Tranche 1A  due fiscal 2017 and Tranche 2.  On June 30, 2016, Toys-Japan entered into an agreement to refinance and combine its Tranche 1B and Tranche 2 committed credit lines due fiscal 2016 into   a   new Tranche 2 committed credit line, expiring on   June 29, 2018  .  Tranche 2 is available in amounts of up to    9.45 billion   (  $90 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) and bears an interest rate of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus   0.80%   per annum.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $4 million   under Tranche 2, with   $86 million   of remaining availability.  We paid fees of   $2 million   to refinance Tranche 2, which are capitalized as deferred debt issuance costs and amortized over the term of the agreement.  Tranche 1A is available in amounts of up to    9.45 billion   (  $90 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) and expires on June 30, 2017.  As of   October 29, 2016   we had outstanding borrowings of   $4 million   under Tranche 1A, with   $86 million   of remaining availability. 
  Additionally, Toys-Japan has   two   uncommitted lines of credit with    1.0 billion   and    0.5 billion   of total availability, respectively.  At   October 29, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding borrowings under these uncommitted lines of credit with a total of    1.5 billion   (  $14 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) of incremental availability. 
  $1.85 billion   secured revolving credit facility, expires fiscal 2019 (  $1,018 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) 
  Under our ABL Facility which expires on March 21, 2019 subject to an earlier springing maturity, we had outstanding borrowings of   $1,018 million  , a total of   $97 million   of outstanding letters of credit and excess availability of   $735 million   as of   October 29, 2016  .  We are subject to a minimum excess availability covenant of   $125 million  , with remaining availability of   $610 million   in excess of the covenant at   October 29, 2016  .  Availability is determined pursuant to a borrowing base, consisting of specified percentages of eligible inventory and credit card receivables and certain Canadian real estate less any applicable availability reserves, and generally peaks in the third quarter of our fiscal year. 
  European and Australian asset-based revolving credit facility, expires fiscal 2020 (  $92 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) 
  The European ABL Facility, as amended, provides for a   five  -year    138 million   (  $168 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility which expires on   December 18, 2020  .  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $92 million  , with   $59 million   of remaining availability under the European ABL Facility. 
  Senior unsecured term loan facility, due fiscal 2019 (  $873 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) 
  The senior unsecured term loan facility due fiscal 2019 (the  Propco I Term Loan Facility ) requires TRU Propco I to prepay outstanding term loans with   25%   of TRU Propco I s annual excess cash flow (as defined in the Propco I Term Loan Facility), subject to the rights of the lenders to decline such prepayment.  As a result, TRU Propco I made a prepayment of   $28 million   on May 13, 2016. 
  In addition, the Propco I Term Loan Facility requires TRU Propco I to prepay outstanding term loans at specified times, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights, in connection with certain asset sales in an amount equal to   65%   of the appraised value (as defined in the Propco I Term Loan Facility) of the real property disposed of in such sale.  As a result, on July 29, 2016, TRU Propco I made a prepayment of   $13 million  . 
  12.000%   Taj senior secured notes, due fiscal 2021 ($  577 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) 
  On August 16, 2016, we, along with our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary TRU Taj LLC ( TRU Taj ) and TRU Taj Finance, Inc. (together with TRU Taj, the  Taj Note Issuers ) completed the offers to exchange the Parent Company s 2017 Notes and 2018 Notes for newly issued Taj Notes and, in the case of the 2017 Notes,   $110 million   in cash (the  Exchange Offers ).  
  Pursuant to the Exchange Offers, aggregate principal amounts of   $345 million   and   $192 million   of the 2017 Notes and 2018 Notes, respectively, were accepted for payment and subsequently canceled.  The Taj Note Issuers issued   $407 million   in aggregate principal amount of Taj Notes and paid   $110 million   in cash consideration, a majority of which was funded by borrowings from the ABL Facility that Toys-Delaware used to settle certain intercompany payables with the Parent Company.  An additional   $34 million   of Taj Notes were issued in concurrent private placements, of which   $26 million   were issued for cash, with the remainder issued as payment to certain noteholders in connection with the Exchange Offers.  Altogether,   $441 million   of Taj Notes were issued, and aggregate principal amounts of   $105 million   and   $208 million   of 2017 Notes and 2018 Notes, respectively, remained outstanding.  The Taj Notes bear an interest rate of   12%   per annum and will mature on August 15, 2021.  Interest is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2017.  
  
    9 

Additionally, on August 26, 2016, the Taj Note Issuers issued an additional   $142 million   of Taj Notes in a private placement.  A portion of the net cash proceeds of   $136 million   from the private placement was used to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of   $105 million   of 2017 Notes, at a redemption price of   102.594%  , plus accrued and unpaid interest.  The remaining net cash proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of other indebtedness of the Company or TRU Taj.  As a result of the Exchange Offers, we expensed   $19 million   of debt issuance costs which was recorded in interest expense.  In addition, we capitalized   $6 million   of net transaction fees and discounts which are being amortized over the term of the Taj Notes into interest expense.  
  Prior to the consummation of the Exchange Offers, the Company and its subsidiaries effected certain internal corporate reorganization transactions, including the formation of the following entities as wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of Toys  R  Us Europe LLC ( Toys Europe ): TRU Taj Holdings 1, LLC, TRU Taj Holdings 2 Limited, TRU Taj Holdings 3, LLC, TRU Taj, TRU (Japan) Holdings Parent Ltd and TRU Taj (Spain) Holdings, LLC.  Prior to, or substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Exchange Offers, the Company and Toys Europe transfered equity interests in certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries to TRU Taj or to subsidiaries of TRU Taj.  Such transferred subsidiaries comprised (i) the Japan, Europe and Australia operations of the Company, (ii) TRU Asia, LLC, which is the indirect parent company of the Company s ownership interest in the Asia JV, and (iii) Wayne Real Estate Parent Company LLC and its subsidiaries. 
  The obligations under the Taj Notes are guaranteed by the Parent Company, certain parent companies of TRU Taj and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of TRU Taj, including certain obligors of the European ABL Facility.  The direct and guaranteed obligations under the Taj Notes (other than the guarantee by the Parent Company) are secured by the pledge of equity interests of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company, including (i) a first priority pledge by an indirect parent company of TRU Taj, (ii) certain first-priority pledges by intermediate holding companies of equity interests of the subsidiaries comprising the Company s Europe operations and (iii) certain second-priority pledges of certain of the equity interests currently pledged in favor of the collateral agent under the European ABL Facility. 
  At any time prior to February 15, 2018, the Taj Note Issuers may redeem all or a part of the Taj Notes at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Taj Notes redeemed, plus a  make-whole  premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  Prior to February 15, 2018, the Taj Note Issuers may redeem during each   twelve  -month period commencing on August 16, 2016 up to   10%   of the aggregate principal outstanding amount of the Taj Notes at their option, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to   103%   of the principal amount of the Taj Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; provided that if less than   10%   of the aggregate principal amount of the Taj Notes are redeemed during the first   twelve  -month period after the issue date, unused amounts may be carried over, but in no event will more than   15%   of the aggregate principal amount of the Taj Notes issued on or after the issue date be redeemed as described in this paragraph. 
  On and after February 15, 2018, the Taj Note Issuers may redeem the Taj Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Taj Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  If certain change of control events occur, the Taj Note Issuers must offer to purchase the Taj Notes at   101%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding the purchase date.  In addition, if the Company or its restricted subsidiaries (including TRU Taj and its restricted subsidiaries) sells assets or incurs certain types of indebtedness, under certain circumstances the Taj Note Issuers must offer to repurchase the Taj Notes at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding the repurchase date on the terms set forth in the indenture. 
  The Taj Notes were issued under an indenture containing covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s and the Taj Notes Issuers  ability and the ability of their respective restricted subsidiaries to incur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons, issue redeemable stock and preferred stock, prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt, make loans and investments, incur certain liens, impose limitations on dividends, loans or asset transfers from subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of its assets to another person and enter into transactions with affiliates (including Toys-Delaware).  These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. 
  The indenture also contains certain events of default (with certain grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to TRU Taj or any guarantor, all outstanding Taj Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.  If any other type of event of default occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least   30%   in principal amount of the then outstanding Taj Notes may declare all such Taj Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subsequent Events 
  On November 3, 2016, we completed   $512 million   of CMBS financing and   $88 million   of mezzanine financing.  The proceeds and a   $51 million   rent prepayment from   Toys-Delaware to TRU Propco II in conjunction with an amendment to the   master lease agreement, along with cash on hand were used to redeem the aggregate principal amount of   $725 million   of Propco II Notes.  TRU Propco II entered into the Mortgage Loan Agreement, providing for the Propco II Mortgage Loan in the initial principal amount of   $512 million  .  The Propco II Mortgage Loan has a   three  -year initial term expiring on November 9, 2019, and may be extended for   two     one  -year terms at the option of TRU Propco II, subject to certain conditions, including meeting certain ratios at the time of the extension and, in the case of the second extension option, payment of an extension fee.  If the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan described below is outstanding, TRU Propco II may only exercise the extension options on the Propco II Mortgage Loan if the term of the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan is also extended.  
  The Propco II Mortgage Loan has been divided into   six   separate components, designated as  Loan Component A  through  Loan Component F,  having payment priority in the order of their alphabetical designation, such that amortization payments, voluntary prepayments and other payments of principal will first be applied to the outstanding principal amount of Loan Component A before being applied to the other loan components.  TRU Propco II will pay interest on each loan component monthly at a per annum rate equal to the sum of the spread applicable to such loan component, plus   one  -month U.S. London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) (subject to a   0%   LIBOR floor).  The initial weighted average spread of the loan components is approximately   4.88%   assuming no principal prepayments or other reduction of the principal balances.   
  TRU Propco II is also required to make monthly repayments according to the amortization schedule in the Mortgage Loan Agreement in amounts between   $6 million   and   $7 million   per year.  The Propco II Mortgage Loan may be prepaid at any time, subject during the   first     eighteen   months of the term to a yield maintenance premium if the aggregate principal balance of the Propco II Mortgage Loan that has been prepaid exceeds a threshold amount.  Any voluntary prepayment must be accompanied by a simultaneous and pro-rata prepayment of the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan.  
  The Propco II Mortgage Loan is secured by, among other things, first mortgage liens on TRU Propco II s fee simple or leasehold interests in its retail properties (the  Propco II Properties ).  The Propco II Properties are leased from TRU Propco II to Toys-Delaware pursuant to an amended and restated master lease agreement, providing for approximately   $67 million   of master lease rent per year.  
  The Mortgage Loan Agreement requires TRU Propco II to enter into, and maintain in effect, an interest rate cap agreement through the initial term of the Propco II Mortgage Loan and any extension.  TRU Propco II has entered into an interest rate cap agreement with an initial notional amount of   $512 million  , capping LIBOR at   2.50%  .  For additional information on the interest rate cap, refer to the Subsequent Event disclosure in   Note   3   entitled    Derivative instruments and hedging activities   . 
  The Mortgage Loan Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default customary for mortgage loans funded in connection with a CMBS financing. 
  The Parent Company has guaranteed the payment and performance of liabilities of TRU Propco II under the Mortgage Loan Agreement for damages resulting from certain breaches or actions, including, but not limited to, certain intentional abuses or destruction of the Propco II Properties, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct, misappropriation or intentional misapplication of funds, the failure of TRU Propco II to remain a single-purpose entity and certain other violations of the Mortgage Loan Agreement and related loan documents.  In addition, the Parent Company and TRU Propco II have indemnified the lenders and certain other indemnified parties from and against certain environmental losses, liabilities and remediation and other costs with respect to the Propco II Properties. 
  Substantially concurrent with the closing of the Propco II Mortgage Loan, the Propco II Mortgage Loan was assigned to TRU Trust 2016-TOYS (the  Trust ), which is currently the sole lender of record.  The Trust is a New York common law trust, which issued the commercial mortgage pass-through certificates sold to investors under the CMBS facility (the  Certificates ).  The Trust is not an affiliate of the Parent Company or any of its affiliates.  The Certificates, which represent beneficial interests in the Trust, are not securities issued by, or obligations of, the Parent Company or any of its affiliates. 
  Additionally, as noted above, on November 3, 2016, Giraffe Junior, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company and the owner of   100%   of the equity interest in TRU Propco II, entered into the Mezzanine Loan Agreement providing for the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan in the initial principal amount of   $88 million  .  The Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan has a   three  -year initial term expiring on November 9, 2019, and may be extended for   two     one  -year terms at the option of Giraffe Junior, subject to certain conditions substantially similar to the conditions to extending the Propco II Mortgage Loan under the Mortgage Loan Agreement.  If the Propco II Mortgage Loan is outstanding, Giraffe Junior may only exercise the extension options if the Propco II Mortgage Loan is also extended. 
  
    11 

The Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan accrues interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to   12.50%  .  There are   no   amortization payments.  The Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan is secured by a first priority pledge of all of Giraffe Junior s ownership interests in TRU Propco II, together with certain accounts and other related collateral of Giraffe Junior, pursuant to a pledge and security agreement.  
  The Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, subject during the   first     eighteen   months of the term to a yield maintenance premium if the aggregate principal balance of the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan that has been prepaid exceeds a threshold amount.  Any voluntary prepayment must be accompanied by a simultaneous and pro-rata prepayment of the TRU Propco II Mortgage Loan.  The Mezzanine Loan Agreement also provides for mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances, including prepayment on each monthly payment date of all amounts remaining in the cash management account following payment of monthly debt service and required reserves under the Propco II Mortgage Loan and Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan. 
  The Mezzanine Loan Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default customary for mezzanine loans of its type. 
  The Parent Company has guaranteed the payment and performance of certain liabilities of Giraffe Junior under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement.  The terms of the guaranty for the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan are substantially similar to the terms of the guaranty for the TRU Propco II Mortgage Loan.  In addition, the Parent Company and Giraffe Junior have indemnified the lenders under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement and certain other indemnified parties from and against certain environmental losses, liabilities and remediation and other costs with respect to the Propco II Properties. 

3  .   Derivative instruments and hedging activities 
  We are exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  We regularly evaluate our exposure and enter into derivative financial instruments to economically manage these risks.  We record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets measured at estimated fair value and we do not offset assets and liabilities with the same counterparty.  We recognize the changes in fair value as unrealized gains and losses.  The recognition of these gains or losses depends on our intended use of the derivatives and the resulting designation.  In certain defined conditions, we may designate a derivative as a hedge for a particular exposure. 
  Interest Rate Contracts 
  As of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , we had   one   interest rate cap designated as a cash flow hedge with a maturity date of   February 27, 2018  .  As of   October 31, 2015  , we had   two   interest rate caps and   one   interest rate swap designated as cash flow hedges.  No material ineffectiveness was recorded for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  We expect to reclassify a net loss of less than   $1 million   over the next   12 months   to Interest expense from   Accumulated other comprehensive loss  . 
  Subsequent Event 
  On   October 31, 2016  , in connection with the Propco II Mortgage Loan,   TRU Propco II   entered into an interest rate cap agreement maturing on   November 15, 2019  , capping LIBOR at   2.50%  , with an initial notional amount of   $512 million   which amortizes in conjunction with the principal of the Propco II Mortgage Loan.  
  Foreign Exchange Contracts 
  As of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we had foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) merchandise purchases of our foreign subsidiaries and our short-term, cross-currency intercompany loans with and between our foreign subsidiaries.  These derivative contracts are not designated as hedges. 
  As   of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , derivative liabilities related to agreements that contain credit-risk related contingent features had fair values of   $3 million   and   $4 million  , respectively.  As of   January 30, 2016  , there were   no   foreign exchange derivative liabilities related to agreements that contain credit-risk related contingent features.

The following table contains the notional amounts and related fair values of our derivatives included within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Refer to Note   4   entitled    Fair value measurements    for the classification of our derivative instruments within the fair value hierarchy. 

4  .   Fair value measurements 
  To determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we utilize the established fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Currently, we use derivative financial arrangements to manage a variety of risk exposures, including interest rate risk associated with our Long-term debt and foreign currency risk relating to cross-currency intercompany lending and merchandise purchases.  The valuation of our foreign currency contracts is determined using market-based foreign exchange rates, which are classified as Level 2 inputs. 
  The valuation of our interest rate contracts is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities.  We evaluate the inputs used to value our derivatives at the end of each reporting period. 
  For our interest rate contracts, we primarily use Level 2 inputs mentioned above to arrive at fair value.  Additionally, for interest rate contracts we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements taking into account the impact of any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.  We measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.  The portfolio-level adjustments are then allocated each period to the individual assets or liabilities within the portfolio. 
  The credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives (which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure) and then applying each counterparty s credit spread to the applicable exposure.  The total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using market-observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities.  The inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from our debt, which are considered unobservable inputs.  These credit valuation adjustments fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and include  
  
    14 

estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default.  For counterparties with publicly available credit information, the credit spreads over the LIBOR used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider.  Generally, significant increases (decreases) in our own credit spread in isolation would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement for these derivatives.  Based on the mixed input valuation, we classify these derivatives based on the lowest level in the fair value hierarchy that is significant to the overall fair value of the instrument. 
  Any transfer into or out of a level of the fair value hierarchy is recognized based on the value of the instruments at the end of the reporting period. 
  The table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , aggregated by level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

For the periods ended   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we had   no   derivative financial instruments within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  We evaluate the carrying value of all long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  Impairment of long-lived assets is included in Other income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The fair value measurements related to long-lived assets held and used classified as Level 3 were determined using a discounted cash flow valuation method or a relative, market-based approach based on purchase offers or appraisals we have re  ceived from third parties.  The inputs we use to calculate discounted cash flows include the projected cash flows for the asset group (generally by store location) and, when significant, a risk-adjusted rate of return we estimate would be used by a market participant in valuing the assets.  The projected cash flows are based on the Company s sales, gross margin and expense forecasts for each asset group, taking into consideration historical cash flows, as well as anticipated costs and/or proceeds from disposal.  For our market-based valuations, we use purchase offers we receive from third parties, predominantly for our properties, which are classified as Level 3 because they are not received in an organized market or observable to market participants.  Alternatively, when management commits to sell properties and no third party offers exist, we use asset appraisals conducted by external specialists with experience in real estate valuations.  These require a significant amount of judgment regarding appropriate comparable properties and their assessment of current market conditions. 
  There have been no changes in valuation technique or related inputs for long-lived assets for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  The table below presents our long-lived assets evaluated for impairment and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , aggregated by level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.  Because these assets are not measured at fair value on   a recurring basis, certain carrying amounts and fair value measurements presented in the table may reflect values at earlier measurement dates and may no longer represent their fair values at   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  As of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we did   not   have any long-lived assets classified as Level 1 or 2 within the fair value hierarchy, respectively.  

Other Financial Instruments 
  The fair values of our Long-term debt including current portion are estimated using quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and other pertinent information available to management as of the end of the respective periods.  The fair values of debt instruments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices in reasonably active markets and Level 2 instruments are valued using market prices we obtain from external third parties.  Debt instruments classified as Level 3 are not publicly traded, and therefore we are unable to obtain quoted market prices, and are generally valued using estimated spreads, a present value  
  
    16 

calculation or a cash flow analysis, as appropriate.  There have been no significant changes in valuation technique or related inputs for Long-term debt for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  The table below presents the carrying values and fair values of our Long-term debt including current portion as of   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , aggregated by level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall. 

Other financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings.  Due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities, their carrying amounts approximate fair value. 

5  .   Income taxes 
  The following table summarizes our Income tax expense and effective tax rates for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

The effective tax rates for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   were based on our forecasted effective tax rates, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented.  Our forecasted effective tax rate was   (1.7)%   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   compared to   (0.4)%   for the same period last year. 
  There were no significant discrete items that impacted our effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , our effective tax rate was impacted by a tax expense of   $1 million   related to adjustments to deferred taxes resulting from a change in statutory tax rate.  There were no significant discrete items that impacted our effective tax rate for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 

6  .   Segments 
  Our reportable segments are Toys  R  Us   Domestic ( Domestic ), which provides toy and baby product offerings in   49   states in the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam, and Toys  R  Us   International ( International ), which operates or licenses  R  Us branded retail stores in   37   foreign countries and jurisdictions with operated stores in Australia, Austria, Brunei, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom.  Our Domestic and International segments also include their respective e-commerce operations.  Segment Operating (loss) earnings excludes corporate related charges and income.  All intercompany transactions between the segments have been eliminated.  Income tax information by segment has not been included as taxes are calculated at a company-wide level and are not allocated to each segment.  Revenues from external customers are derived primarily from merchandise sales and we do not generate material sales from any single customer.

7  .   Litigation and legal proceedings 
  We are, and in the future may be, involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of business.  The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable.  Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources.  We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable, primarily for the following reasons: (i) many of the relevant legal proceedings are in preliminary stages, and until such proceedings develop further, there is often uncertainty regarding the relevant facts and circumstances at issue and potential liability; and (ii) many of these proceedings involve matters of which the outcomes are inherently difficult to predict.  However, based upon our historical experience with similar matters, we do not expect that any such additional losses would be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Sponsors provide management and advisory services to us pursuant to an advisory agreement executed at the closing of the merger transaction effective as of July 21, 2005 and amended June 10, 2008, February 1, 2009, August 29, 2014, June 1, 2015 and December 1, 2015 ( Advisory Agreement ).  The term of the Advisory Agreement is currently a   one  -year renewable term unless we or the Sponsors provide notice of termination to the other.  Management and advisory fees (the  Advisory Fees ) of   $6 million   per annum are payable on a quarterly basis.  The Advisory Agreement includes customary exculpation and indemnification provisions in favor of the Sponsors and their affiliates.  In the event that the Advisory Agreement is terminated by the Sponsors or us, the Sponsors will receive all unpaid Advisory Fees and expenses due under the Advisory Agreement with respect to periods prior to the termination date plus the net present value of the Advisory Fees that would have been payable for the remainder of the then applicable   one  -year term of the Advisory Agreement. 
  We recorded Advisory Fees of   $2 million   and   $5 million   for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively.  We recorded Advisory Fees of   $1 million   and   $6 million   for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  During each of the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , we also paid the Sponsors for out-of-pocket expenses, which were   nominal  .  During each of the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , out-of-pocket expenses paid to the Sponsors were less than   $1 million  . 
  Other Relationships and Transactions with the Sponsors  
  From time to time, we and our subsidiaries, as well as the Sponsors or their affiliates, may acquire debt or debt securities issued by us or our subsidiaries in open market transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  During the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , affiliates of KKR held debt and debt securities issued by the Company and its subsidiaries.  The interest amounts on such debt and debt securities held by related parties were   nominal   and   $1 million   during the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively.  The interest amounts on such debt and debt securities held by related parties were   $1 million   and   $6 million   during the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Additionally, under lease agreements with affiliates of Vornado, we paid an aggregate amount of   $2 million   and   $6 million   for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, with respect to less than   1%   of our operated stores, which include Toys  R  Us Express stores.  Of the aggregate amount paid, less than   $1 million   and   $1 million   for each of the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, was allocable to joint-venture parties not otherwise affiliated with Vornado. 
  Each of the Sponsors, either directly or through affiliates, has ownership interests in a broad range of companies ( Portfolio Companies ) with whom we may from time to time enter into commercial transactions in the ordinary course of business, primarily for the purchase of goods and services.  We believe that none of our transactions or arrangements with Portfolio Companies are significant enough to be considered material to the Sponsors or to our business. 

9  .   Dispositions 
  During the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , we sold intellectual property related to the FAO Schwarz brand for proceeds of   $45 million  , resulting in a net gain of   $45 million  .  During the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , we sold   a   property and certain assets, including the FAO Schwarz brand, for proceeds of   $47 million  , resulting in net gains of   $45 million  .  Net gains on sales are included in Other income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

10. Stock-based compensation 
  One-time award 
  On   September 12, 2016  , the Company amended its stock option agreement with Michael J. Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, dated October 10, 2014 pursuant to which the Company amended the vesting conditions for Mr. Short s outstanding performance-based options issued under the Toys  R  Us, Inc. 2010 Incentive Plan (the  2010 Incentive Plan ).  As a result of this amendment, these options are time-based and vested   fifty   percent on October 10, 2016 with the remaining portion vesting in equal annual installments over the subsequent   two   years.  We accounted for this modification in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ).  The modification resulted in   no   incremental expense over the remaining term of the award. 
  On July 27, 2016, the Company amended its employment agreement with Mr. Short, dated June 19, 2014, to allow Mr. Short to participate in the 2010 Incentive Plan effective September 12, 2016.  On September 12, 2016, the Company provided Mr. Short with a grant of   250,000   options under the 2010 Incentive Plan.  The options have an exercise price of   $11.00   per share with a grant date fair value of   $1 million  .  The options are scheduled to vest   fifty   percent on the   second   anniversary of the grant date with the remaining portion vesting in equal annual installments over the subsequent   two   years, subject to Mr. Short s continued employment on each such date.

  Total other comprehensive (loss) income, net of ta  x is included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss and   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders  Deficit  .    Accumulated other comprehensive loss   is reflected in   Total stockholders  deficit   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as follows: 

12  .   Recent accounting pronouncements 
  In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash  ( ASU 2016-18 ).  ASU 2016-18 provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.  Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should now be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the statements of cash flows.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  Other than the revised statement of cash flows presentation of restricted cash, the adoption of ASU 2016-16 is not expected to have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  
    20 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17  Consolidation (Topic 810), Interests Held Through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control  ( ASU 2016-17 ).  ASU 2016-17 changes how a single decision maker will consider its indirect interests when performing the primary beneficiary analysis under the variable interest entity ( VIE ) model.  Under ASU 2015-02  Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  a single decision maker was required to consider an indirect interest held by a related party under common control in its entirety.  Under ASU 2016-17, the single decision maker will consider the indirect interest on a proportionate basis.  ASU 2016-17 does not change the characteristics of a primary beneficiary in the VIE model.  The amendments of ASU 2016-17 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2016-17 is not expected to have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  ( ASU 2016-16 ).  ASU 2016-16 requires companies to account for income tax effects of intercompany transactions other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. This is a change from current GAAP, which requires companies to defer the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized (i.e. depreciation, amortization, impaired).  ASU 2016-16 will still require companies to defer the income tax effects of intercompany inventory transactions.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2016-16 is not expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the following eight specific cash flow classification issues: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (6) distributions received from equity method investees; (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  Current GAAP does not include specific guidance on these eight cash flow classification issues.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.      
  In March 201  6, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ).  Under ASU 2016-09, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ).  Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the APIC pools will be eliminated.  In addition, ASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them.  ASU 2016-09 also requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity.  Furthermore, ASU 2016-09 will increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation.  An employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation will now be allowed to withhold shares with a fair value up to the amount of taxes owed using the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee s applicable jurisdiction(s).  ASU 2016-09 requires a company to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows.  Under current GAAP, it was not specified how these cash flows should be classified.  In addition, companies will now have to elect whether to account for forfeitures on share-based payments by (1) recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or (2) estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change, as is currently required.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07  Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  ( ASU 2016-07 ).  ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement that when an investment subsequently qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held.  This ASU requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and to adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  In addition, ASU 2016-07 requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method.  The

amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  ( ASU 2016-06 ).  ASU 2016-06 clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent put or call options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related.  Under current GAAP, two divergent approaches developed.  Under the first approach, the assessment of whether contingent put or call options are clearly and closely related to the debt host only requires an analysis of the four-step decision sequence of ASC 815-15-25-42.  Under the second approach, in addition to the four-step decision sequence of ASC 815-15-2-42, some entities evaluate whether the ability to exercise the put or call options are triggered by the entities interest rates or credit risk.  ASU 2016-06 clarifies that an entity is required to assess whether the economic characteristics and risks of embedded put or call options are clearly and closely related to those of their debt hosts only in accordance with the four-step decision sequence of ASC 815-15-2-42.  An entity should not assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a put or call option is related to interest rates or credit risk of the entity.  ASU 2016-06 does not change the existing criteria for determining when bifurcation of an embedded put or call option in a debt instrument is required.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing debt instruments using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  ( ASU 2016-05 ).  ASU 2015-05 provides guidance clarifying that the novation of a derivative contract (i.e. a change in counterparty) in a hedge accounting relationship does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedge accounting relationship.  This ASU amends ASC 815 to clarify that such a change does not, in and of itself, represent a termination of the original derivative instrument or a change in the critical terms of the hedge relationship.  ASU 2016-05 allows the hedging relationship to continue uninterrupted if all of the other hedge accounting criteria are met, including the expectation that the hedge will be highly effective when the creditworthiness of the new counterpart to the derivative contract is considered.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  Entities may adopt the guidance prospectively or use a modified retrospective approach.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-05 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04  Liabilities - Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20), Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products  ( ASU 2016-04 ).  ASU 2015-04 requires entities that sell prepaid stored-value products redeemable for goods, services or cash at third-party merchants to recognize breakage (i.e. the value that is ultimately not redeemed by the consumer) in a way that is consistent with how it will be recognized under the new revenue recognition standard.  Under current GAAP, there is diversity in practice in how entities account for breakage that results when a consumer does not redeem the entire product balance.  Some entities view liabilities for prepaid stored-value products that can be redeemed only for goods or services from a third-party as nonfinancial because the issuer s obligation to the consumer will be settled by the transfer of goods or services (albeit by a third-party), not cash.  Others view these liabilities as financial, given that the issuer is ultimately obligated to transfer cash to a third-party.  This ASU clarifies that an entity s liability for prepaid stored-value products within its scope meets the definition of a financial liability.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  Entities will apply the guidance using either a modified retrospective approach or a full retrospective approach.  The adoption of ASU 2016-04 is not expected to have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ).  The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-to-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from current GAAP.  ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases (i.e. capital leases under current GAAP) and operating leases.  The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases will be substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases under current GAAP.  The accounting applied by the lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under current GAAP.  The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  An entity will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ).  ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards.  The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.  The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.  Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances.  The amendments of ASU 2014-09 were effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption prohibited.  Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. 
  Subsequent to issuing ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued the following amendments concerning the adoption and clarification of ASU 2014-09.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which deferred the effective date one year.  As a result, the amendments of ASU 2014-09 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)  ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard.  ASU 2016-08 clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.  ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP.  In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria.  Management is currently assessing the adoption methodology and the impact the adoption of these ASUs will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     As used herein, the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our  means Toys  R  Us, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires.  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to help facilitate an understanding of our historical results of operations during the periods presented and our financial condition.  This MD A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  See  Forward-Looking Statements  below. 

Our Business 
  We generate sales, earnings and cash flows by retailing a variety of toy and baby products worldwide through our omnichannel offerings     that leverage the synergies between our brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce.  Our reportable segments are Toys  R  Us   Domestic ( Domestic ), which operates     in   49   states, Pu  erto Rico and Guam, and Toys  R  Us   International ( International ), which operates or licenses stores in     37     foreign countries and jurisd  ictions.  As of   October 29, 2016  , there were   1,661   operated and   249   licensed  R  Us branded retail stores worldwide.  Our Dom  estic and International segments also include their respective e-commerce operatio  ns.  

Financial Performance 
  As discussed in more detail in this MD A, the following financial data represents an overview of our financial performance for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    For an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the Company s operating performance and a reconciliation to   Net loss attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc.  , see  Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted EBITDA . 
     Third   quarter 2016 financial highlights: 
             
    Net sales   decreased   by   $53 million   compared to the prior year period, predominantly due to a decrease in same store sales and Domestic store closures.  
                
    C  onsolidated same store sales decreased by   2.1   percentage points due to a decline in both our Domestic and International segments. 
                
    Gross margin, as a percentage of Net sales, ( Gross margin rate ) increased in our International segment and remained flat Domestically.  
                
    SG A   increased   by   $8 million   primarily due to an increase in advertising, partially offset by a reduction in occupancy costs. 
                
    Net loss attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc.   decreased by   $11 million  . 
     Year-to-date 2016 financial highlights: 
             
    Net sales   decreased   by   $70 million   compared to the prior year period, predominantly due to Domestic store closures.  
                
    Cons  olidated same store sales decreased by   0.3   percentage points driven by a decline in our Domestic segment. 
                
    Gross margin rate declined in our Domestic segment due to increased e-commerce sales, partially offset by an increase in our International segment. 
     
    24 

SG A   decreased   by   $27 million   primarily due to a reduction in occupancy costs, partially offset by an increase in advertising. 
                
    Net loss attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc.   decreased by   $29 million  . 

Same Store Sales 
  In computing same store sales, we include stores that have been open for at least 56 weeks from their  soft  opening date.  A soft opening is typically two weeks prior to the grand opening.  Express stores that have a cumulative lease term of at least two years ( Permanent Express ) and have been open for at least 56 weeks from their soft opening date are also included in the computation of same store sales. 
  Our same store sales computation includes the following: 
             
    st  ores that have b  een remodeled while remaining open; 
                
    store  s that have been relocated and/or expanded to new buildings within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes; 
                
    stores that have expanded within their current locations; and 
                
    sales from our e-com  merce businesses. 
     By measuring the year-over-year sales of merchandise in the stores that have been open for 56 weeks or more and online, we can better gauge how   the core store base and e-commerce business is performing since same store sales excludes the impact of store openings and closings, as well as foreign currency translation. 
  Various factors affect same store sales, including the number of and timing of stores we open, close, convert, relocate or expand, the number of transactions, the average transaction amount, the general retail sales environment, current local and global economic conditions, consumer preferences and buying trends, changes in sales mix among distribution channels, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise mix, competition, the timing of the release of new merchandise and our promotional events, the success of marketing programs and the cannibalization of existing store net sales by new stores.  Among other things, weather conditions, terrorism and catastrophic events can affect same store sales because they may discourage travel or require temporary store closures, thereby reducing customer traffic.  These factors have caused our same store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis and, as a result, we expect that same store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future. 
  The changes in our same stor  e sales for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   are as follows: 

Percentage of Net Sales by Product Category 

(1) 
       Consists primarily of non-product related revenues. 
     
    25 

(1) 
    Consists primarily of non-product related revenues, including licensing revenue from unaffiliated third parties. 
     From time to time, we may make revisions to our prior period Net sales by product category to conform to the current period allocation.  These revisions did not have a significant impact to our prior year disclosure. 

Store Count by Segment 

(1) 
    The net increase in International stores compared to the prior year is primarily due to 32 stores in China and Southeast Asia. 

Net Loss Attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc. 

Net loss attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc.   decreased by   $11 million   to   $156 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $167 million   for the same period last year.  The decrease was primarily due to an increase in Other income, net of   $38 million  , partially offset by a   $11 million   decline in Gross margin, a   $9 million   increase in Interest expense and an increase in SG A of   $8 million  .   
  Net loss attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc.   decreased by   $29 million   to   $377 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $406 million   for the same period last year.  The decrease was primarily due to an increase in Other income, net of   $49 million  , a reduction in SG A of   $27 million   and a decrease in Depreciation and amortization of   $13 million  , partially offset by a   $40 million   decline in Gross margin, a   $14 million   increase in Interest expense and a   $6 million   increase in Income tax expense.

Net Sales 

Net sales   decreased   by   $53 million   or   2.3%  , to   $2,278 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $2,331 million   for the same period last year.  Foreign currency translation   increased   Net sales by   $22 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  . 
  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, the   decrease   in Net sales was due to a decline in Domestic same store sales driven by a decrease in the number of transactions and Domestic store closures, including our Times Square flagship store.  Additionally contributing to the decrease was a decline in International same store sales primarily driven by a decrease in the number of transactions.  Consolidated e-commerce sales increased   9%   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year.

  Domestic 
  Net sales for our Domestic segment   decreased   by   $53 million   or   3.8%  , to   $1,349 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , primarily due to a decline in same store sales of   1.9%   and store closures. 
  The   decrease   in same store sales resulted primarily from decreases in our entertainment and baby categories.  The decline in our entertainment category was mainly due to  toys to life  video game products.  The decline in our baby category was predominantly due to infant care products and baby gear.  Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in our learning and core toy categories.  The increase in our learning category was primarily due to preschool toys and trading cards and accessories.  The increase in our core toy category was mainly due to dolls. 
  Net sales for our Dome  stic segment   decreased   by   $118 million   or   2.7%  , to   $4,184 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , primarily due to store closures and a decline in same store sales of   0.6%  .

The increase in our seasonal category was primarily due to   sports and water toys.    The increase in our core toy category was mainly due to dolls. 
  International 
  Excluding a   $22 million     increase   from foreign currency translation, International Net sales decreased for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , primarily due to a   2.5%   decrease in same store sales, driven by our Asia Pacific and Europe markets, partially offset by growth in Canada. 
  
    27 

The   decrease   in sam  e store sales resulted primarily from decreases in our entertainment and learning categories.  The decrease in our entertainment category was primarily due to video game software and systems and  toys to life  products.  The decrease in our learning category was mainly due to construction toys.  
  Net sales for our International segment   increased   by   $48 million   or   1.8%  , to   $2,695 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  Excluding a   $32 million     increase   from foreign currency translation, International Net sales improved primarily as a result of an increase in net sales from new locations and a   0.3%     increase   in same store sales driven by our Canada market. 
  The   increase   in same store sales resulted primarily from improvements in our learning and baby categories.  The increase in our learning category was mainly due to   preschool toys and board games.  The increase in our baby category was primarily due to baby gear and apparel.

Gross Margin 
  The following are reflected in  Cost of sales : 
             
    the   cost of merchandise acquired from vendors; 
                
    freight in; 
                
    provision for excess and obsolete inventory; 
                
    shipping costs to consumers; 
                
    provision for inventory shortages; and 
                
    credits and   allowances from our merchandise vendors. 
     We record the costs associated with operating our distribution networks as a part of SG A, including those costs that primarily relate to transporting merchandise from distribution centers to stores.  Therefore, our consolidated Gross margin may not be comparable to the gross margins of other retailers that include similar costs in their cost of sales. 

Gross margin   decreased   by   $11 million   to   $821 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $832 million   for the same period last year.  Foreign currency translation   increased   Gross margin by   $7 million  . 
  Gross margin rate   increased   by   0.3   percentage points for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year.  The   increase   in Gross margin rate was primarily the result of margin improvements within certain categories in our International segment.    

  Gross margin   decreased   by   $40 million   to   $2,529 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $2,569 million   for the same period last year.  Foreign currency translation   increased   Gross margin by   $9 million  . 
  Gross margin rate   decreased   by   0.2   percentage points for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year.  The   decrease   in Gross margin rate was primarily due to an increase in shipping costs from higher e-commerce sales coupled with a reduction in our free shipping purchase minimum in our Domestic segment. 
  
    28 

Domestic 
  Gross margin   decreased   by   $18 million   to   $459 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  Gross margin rate remained consistent for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year.

  The   decrease   in Gross margin rate for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   was primarily from higher shipping costs due to an increase in e-commerce sales coupled with a reduction in our free shipping purchase minimum from $49 to $19 launched in September 2015. 
  International 
  Gross margin   increased   by   $7 million   to   $362 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  Foreign currency translati  on   increased   Gross margin by   $7 million  .  Gross margin rate   increased     by   0.8   percentage points   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year. 
  The   increase   in G  ross margin rate resulted from margin rate improvements in our core toy, entertainment and baby categories.  Additionally contributing to the improvement was sales mix away from lower margin entertainment products. 
  Gro  ss margin   increased   by   $20 million   to   $1,066 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  Foreign currency translation   increased   Gross margin by   $9 million  .

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  The followin  g table p  resents expenses as a percentage of consolidated SG A: 

(1) 
    Prima  rily cons  ists of credit card fees.  
              (2) 
    Incl  udes cost  s related to website hosting, transporting merchandise from distribution centers to stores, store related supplies and signage and other corporate-related expenses. 

SG A   increased   by   $8 million   to   $835 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $827 million   for th  e same p  eriod last year.  Foreign currency translation   increased   SG A by   $6 million  .  As a percentage of Net sales, SG A   increased   by   1.2   percentage points. 
  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG A   increased   by   $2 million   primarily due to a   $8 million   increase in advertising and promotional expenses, mainly related to the   timing of our  Big Book  holiday catalog release  .  Partially offsetting the increase was a   $6 million   decrease in occupancy costs, predominantly as a result of the closure of our Times Square flagship store.

SG     A   decreased   by   $27 million   to   $2,423 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $2,450 million   for the same period last year.  Foreign currency translation   increased   SG A by   $8 million  .  As a percentage of Net sales, SG A decreased by   0.1   percentage point. 
  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG A   decreased   by   $35 million   primarily due to a   $45 million   decline in occupancy costs, predominantly as a result of the closure of our Times Square and FAO Schwarz flagship stores and a   $10 million   decrease in payroll expenses.  Partially offsetting the decrease was a   $14 million   increase in advertising and promotional expenses and a   $7 million   increase in website hosting costs. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization     decreased   by   $4 million   and   $13 million   for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively  , compared to the same periods last year.  The   decrease   for both periods was primarily due to fully depreciated assets and closed stores. 

Oth  er I  ncome, Net 
  Other income, net   includes the following: 
             
    net gains on sales; 
                
    c  redit card program income; 
                
    gift card breakage income; 
                
    impairment of long-lived assets; 
                
    foreign exchange gains and losses; and 
                
    other operating inc  ome and expenses. 

Other income, net   increased   by   $38 million   to   $59 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $21 million   for the same period last year.    Other   income, net   increased   by   $49 million   to   $114 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .    The increase in both periods was primarily due to the sale of the FAO Schwarz brand. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense   increased   by   $9 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year.  The   increase   was primarily due to an incremental $19 million of expense for debt issuance costs related to the Exchange Offers (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt), partially offset by   the change in value of foreign exchange contracts and     a reduction in deferred debt issuance costs primarily as a result of the   fiscal 2015   amendment to the advisory agreement, which waived any previously accrued and unpaid transaction fees payable to our Sponsors in connection with prior refinancings.   
  Interest expense   increased   by   $14 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to the same period last year.  The   increase   was primarily due to   an incremental $19 million of expense   for debt issuance costs related to the Exchange

Offers,   partially   offset by a reduction in deferred debt issuance costs primarily as a result of the   fiscal 2015   amendment to the advisory agreement.  
  As a result of the   Taj Notes   and CMBS and mezzanine debt refinancings in fiscal 2016, we expect that our annual net cash interest paid will decrease by approximately   $12 million  , based on LIBOR rates as of   October 29, 2016  ,   primarily due to a lower rate of interest on the Propco II Mortgage Loan   (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt)  .  

Interest Income 

Interest income   remained consistent   for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  

Income Tax Expense 
  The following table summarizes our   Income tax expense   and effective tax rates for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

The effective tax rates for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   were based on our forecasted effective tax rates, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented.  Our forecasted effective tax rate was   (1.7)%   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   compared to   (0.4)%   for the same period last year. 
  There were no significant discrete items that impacted our effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , our effective tax rate was impacted by a tax expense of   $1 million   related to adjustments to deferred taxes resulting from a change in statutory tax rate.  There were no significant discrete items that impacted our effective tax rate for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted EBITDA 
  We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.  Investors in the Company regularly request Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental analytical measure to, and in conjunction with, the Company s financial data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).  We understand that investors use Adjusted EBITDA, among other things, to assess our period-to-period operating performance and to gain insight into the manner in which management analyzes operating performance. 
  In addi  tion, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  We use the non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and measuring results against the forecast and in certain cases we use similar measures for bonus targets for certain of our employees.  Using several measures to evaluate the business allows us and investors to assess our relative performance against our competitors. 
  Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies, even in the same industry, may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.  As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance.  The Company does not, and investors should not, place undue reliance on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance.

Reconciliation of Net los  s attributable to Toys  R  Us, Inc. to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:    

(a) 
    Represents the i  ncreme  ntal compensation expense related to certain one-time awards and modifications, net of forfeitures of certain officers  awards. 
              (b) 
    Represent  s expenses associated with the transition of our U.S. e-commerce operations and other transaction costs. 
              (c) 
    Represents the unrealized loss (gain) on foreign exchange related to the re-measurement of the portion of the   Tranche A-1 loan facility   attributed to Toys-Canada. 
              (d) 
    Represents the fees expensed to our Sponsors in accordance with the advisory agreement. 
              (e) 
    Represents sales of properties and intellectual property. 
              (f) 
    Represents certain litigation expenses and settlements recorded for legal matters. 
              (g) 
    Represents property losses and insurance claims recognized. 
              (h) 
    Represents store closure costs, net of lease surrender income. 
              (i) 
    Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings (loss) before net interest income (expense), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization), as further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain income and expense items that management believes make it more difficult to assess the Company s actual operating performance including certain items which are generally non-recurring.  We have excluded the impact of such items from internal performance assessments.  We believe that excluding items such as Sponsors  management and advisory fees, asset impairment charges, severance, impact of litigation, store closure costs,   noncontrolling interest,   net gains on sales and other charg  es, helps investors compare our operating performance with our results in prior periods.  We believe it is appropriate to exclude these items as they are not related to ongoing operating performance and, therefore, limit comparability between periods and between us and similar companies. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the covenants related to our outstanding debt.  Under the $1.85 billion secured revolving credit facility ( ABL Facility ), we had outstanding borrowings of   $1,018 million  , a total of   $97  
  
    32 

million   of outstanding letters of credit and excess availability of   $735 million   as of   October 29, 2016  .  We are subject to a minimum excess availability covenant of   $125 million  , with remaining availability of   $610 million   in excess of the covenant at   October 29, 2016  .  Availability is determined pursuant to a borrowing base, consisting of specified percentages of eligible inventory among other assets, and generally peaks in the third quarter of our fiscal year.  As of   October 29, 2016  , Toys  R  Us   Delaware, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total liquidity of   $799 million  , which included cash and cash equivalents of   $189 million  .  
  Toys    R  Us   Japan, Ltd. ( Toys-Japan ) has an agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which includes two unsecured loan commitment lines of credit ( Tranche 1A  and  Tranche 2 ).  Tranche 1A is available in amounts of up to    9.45 billion   (  $90 million   at   October 29, 2016  ).  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $4 million   under Tranche 1A, with   $86 million   of remaining availability.  Tranche 2 is available in amounts of up to    9.45 billion   (  $90 million   at   October 29, 2016  ).  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $4 million   under Tranche 2, with   $86 million   of remaining availability.  As of   October 29, 2016  , Toys-Japan had total liquidity of   $187 million   under committed facilities, which included cash and cash equivalents of   $15 million  .  
  Additionally, Toys-Japan has two uncommitted lines of credit with    1.0 billion   and    0.5 billion   of total availability, respectively.  At   October 29, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding borrowings under these uncommitted lines of credit with a total of    1.5 billion   (  $14 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) of incremental availability. 
  Our European and Australian asset-based revolving credit facility as amended (the  European ABL Facility ) provides for a   five  -year    138 million   (  $168 million   at   October 29, 2016  ) asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $92 million  , with   $59 million   of remaining availability under the European ABL Facility.  As of   October 29, 2016  , Europe and Australia had total liquidity of   $122 million  , which included cash and cash equivalents of   $63 million  .  
  Toys (Labuan) Holding Limited ( Asia JV ) has several uncommitted unsecured lines of credit with various financial institutions with total availability of HK  $274 million   (  $35 million   at   October 29, 2016  ).  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had   $7 million   of borrowings and   $5 million   of bank guarantees issued under these facilities.  The remaining availability under these facilities was   $23 million  . 
  We are dependent on the borrowings provided by our lenders to support our working capital needs, capital expenditures and to service debt.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we have funds available to finance our operations under our ABL Facility through   March 2019  , subject to an earlier springing maturity, our Toys-Japan unsecured credit lines with a tranche expiring   June 2017   and a tranche expiring   June 2018   and our European ABL Facility through   December 2020  .  In addition, Asia JV and Toys-Japan have uncommitted lines of credit, which are due on demand.  If our cash flow and capital resources do not provide the necessary liquidity, it could have a significant negative effect on our results of operations. 
  In general, our primary uses of cash are providing for working capital purposes (which principally represents the purchase of inventory), servicing debt, remodeling existing stores, financing construction of new stores and paying expenses, such as payroll costs and rental expense, to operate our stores.  Our working capital needs follow a seasonal pattern, peaking in the third quarter of the year when inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter holiday selling season.  For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, peak borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and credit lines amounted to   $1,126 million  , with remaining availability of   $841 million   in excess of the ABL Facility covenant.  Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers.  We have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and credit lines. 
  Although we believe that cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash, revolving credit facilities and credit lines will be sufficient to fund ou  r expected cash flow requirements and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, financial market disruption could have a negative impact on our ability to refinance our maturing debt and available resources in the future. 

Capital Expenditures 
  A component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program.  Our capital expenditures are primarily for enhancing our e-commerce and other information technology and logistics systems, as well as improving existing stores and construction of new stores.  Capital expenditures are funded primarily through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash.

The   increase   was primarily due to higher Domestic vendor payments in fiscal 2016 for merchandise purchased in fiscal 2015 as part of our continued focus to maintain stronger in-stock positions. 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased by   $1 million   to   $128 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $129 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , primarily due to a   $35 million   increase in capital expenditures, offset by a   $35 million   increase in proceeds received from sales of assets.  
  Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
  Ne  t cash provided by financing activities increased by   $79 million   to   $910 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , compared   to   $831 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , primarily due to a   $100 million     increase   in net long-term debt borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to finance our increased purchases of merchandise inventories and to fund a portion of the TRU Taj LLC exchange offer, partially offset by a   $12 million   distribution to the Asia JV s minority interest partner in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. 

Debt 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had total indebtedness of   $5.6 billion  , of which   $4.2 billion   was secured indebtedness.  During the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , the following events occurred with respect to our debt structure: 
             
    On August 16, 2016, we, along with our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary TRU Taj LLC ( TRU Taj ) and TRU Taj Finance, Inc. (together with TRU Taj, the  Taj Note Issuers ) completed the offers to exchange the Parent Company s outstanding 10.375% senior notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ) and 7.375% senior notes due 2018 (the  2018 Notes  and, together with the 2017 Notes, the  Senior Notes ) for newly issued 12.000% senior secured notes due fiscal 2021 (the  Taj Notes ) of the Taj Note Issuers and, in the case of the 2017 Notes, $110 million in cash (the  Exchange Offers ).    An additional   $34 million   of Taj Notes were issued in concurrent private placements, of which   $26 million   were issued for cash, with the remainder issued as payment to certain noteholders in connection with the Exchange Offers.    Additionally, on August 26, 2016, the Taj Note Issuers issued an additional   $142 million   of Taj Notes in a private placement, of which a portion of the proceeds was used to redeem the remaining 2017 Notes.    As a result of  
     
    34 

these transactions, all of the 2017 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of   $450 million  , and $192 million of the 2018 Notes were exchanged or redeemed, with $208 million in principal of the 2018 Notes still outstanding.  The aggregate principal amount of Taj Notes issued was $583 million.  
   Refer to Note   2   to ou  r Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements entitled    Short-term borrowings and long-term debt    for further details regarding our debt. 
  Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by global economic and financial market conditions and other economic factors that may be outside our control.  Such refinancings may include the issuance or guarantee of debt by certain of our subsidiaries, and may be accompanied by transactions or asset transfers among certain of our subsidiaries.  Any debt issued in such transactions may be issued or guaranteed by entities that are not obligors on the debt being refinanced, and may have liens on assets that are not pledged to secure the debt being refinanced. 
  In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which may enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the covenants in our credit facilities and indentures and the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows, results of operations, economic and market conditions and other factors. 
  We and our subsidiaries, as well as the Sponsors or their affiliates, may from time to time prepay, repurchase, refinance or otherwise acquire debt or debt securities issued by us or our subsidiaries in open market transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Any such transactions, and the amounts involved, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  The amounts involved may be material.  Refer to Note   8   to our Condensed Cons  olidated Financial Statements entitled    Related party transactions    and Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements entitled  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  . 
  Subsequent Refinancings 
  On November 3, 2016, we completed the $512 million of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ( CMBS ) financing and $88 million of mezzanine financing.   The proceeds and a $51 million rent prepayment from   Toys-Delaware to Toys  R  Us Property Company II, LLC ( TRU Propco II ) in conjunction with an amendment to the   master lease agreement, along with cash on hand were used to redeem the aggregate principal amount of $725 million of 8.500% senior secured notes due 2017 of   TRU Propco II   (the  Propco II Notes ).  TRU Propco II entered into a mortgage loan agreement (the  Mortgage Loan Agreement ), providing for a floating-rate loan (the  Propco II Mortgage Loan ) in the initial principal amount of $512 million.  The Propco II Mortgage Loan has a three-year initial term expiring in November 2019, and may be extended for two one-year terms at the option of TRU Propco II, subject to certain conditions, including meeting certain ratios at the time of the extension and, in the case of the second extension option, payment of an extension fee.  If the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan described below is outstanding, TRU Propco II may only exercise the extension options on the Propco II Mortgage Loan if the term of the Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan is also extended.  
  Additionally, as noted above, on November 3, 2016, Giraffe Junior Holdings, LLC ( Giraffe Junior ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company and the owner of 100% of the equity interest in TRU Propco II, entered into a mezzanine loan agreement (the  Mezzanine Loan Agreement ) providing for a fixed-rate loan (the  Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan ) in the initial principal amount of $88 million. The Giraffe Junior Mezzanine Loan has a three-year initial term expiring in November 2019, and may be extended for two one-year terms at the option of Giraffe Junior, subject to certain conditions substantially similar to the conditions to extending the Propco II Mortgage Loan under the Mortgage Loan Agreement. If the Propco II Mortgage Loan is outstanding, Giraffe Junior may only exercise the extension options if the Propco II Mortgage Loan is also extended. 
  Refer to Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements entitled  Short-term borrowing and long-term debt  for further details on the CMBS and mezzanine financings. 

Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations consist mainly of payments related to Long-term debt and related interest, operating leases related to real estate used in the operation of our business and product purchase obligations.  Due to changes in our Long-term debt during the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016     described in Note   2   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements entitled    Short-term borrowings and long-term debt  ,  we have provided updated Short-term borrowings and long-term debt and  
  
    35 

Interest payment information.  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations associated with our Short-term borrowings and long-term debt and related Interest payments as of   October 29, 2016  .  The balances below do not include the impact of the CMBS and mezzanine financing and subsequent redemption of the $725 million Propco II Notes which were completed subsequent to   October 29, 2016  .    Refer to the    Subsequent Events    section in Note   2   entitled    Short-term borrowings and long-term debt    for further details.

              (4) 
    Interest payments for our ABL Facility, European ABL Facility and our Toys-Japan unsecured credit lines were estimated based on the average borrowings under each of the facilities for the last twelve months. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and during the applicable periods.  We base these estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   for a discussion of critical accounting policies. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-16  Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  ( ASU 2015-16 ).  ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Under the previous guidance, an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period retrospectively (i.e. as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed at the acquisition date).  That is, the acquirer must revise comparative information on the income statement and balance sheet for any prior periods affected.  Under ASU 2015-16, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments in the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earning by line item that would have been in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  ASU 2015-16 did not change the criteria for determining whether an adjustment qualifies as a measurement-period adjustment and does not change the length of the measurement period.  The Company has adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-16, effective January 31, 2016.  The adoption did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)  : Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ( ASU 2015-05 ).  Existing GAAP does not include explicit guidance about a customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.  The amendments in this ASU provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software licenses element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  As a result of the  
  
    36 

amendments, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets.    An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date; or (2) retrospectively.  The Company adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-05 as of January 31, 2016 on a prospective basis.  The adoption did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued No. ASU 2015-04,  Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets  ( ASU 2015-04 ).  For entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end, ASU 2015-04 provides a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity s fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently from year-to-year.  Under the previous practice, entities with fiscal year-ends that did not coincide with a month-end, had to adjust the fair value of the plan assets reported by the third-party service provider to reflect the fair value of plan assets as of their fiscal year.  The practical expedient should be applied consistently to all plans if an entity has more than one plan.  An entity is required to disclose the accounting policy election and the date used to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations in accordance with the amendments in this ASU.  Additional disclosures are required if a contribution or significant event caused by the entity occurs between the month-end date used to measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations and an entity s fiscal year-end.  Entities should apply the amendments in this update prospectively.  The Company adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-04, effective January 31, 2016.  The adoption did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ).  ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  Under the previous practice, debt issuance costs were recognized as a deferred charge (that is, an asset).  This ASU will create consistencies with the guidance in International Financial Reporting Standards as well as the guidance in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,  Elements of Financial Statements , which states that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15  Interest - Imputed Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ), which clarifies that the guidance in ASU 2015-03 does not apply to line-of-credit arrangements.  According to ASU 2015-15, line-of-credit arrangements will continue to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt costs ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle.  The Company has adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, effective January 31, 2016.  Other than the revised balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs from an asset to a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability and related disclosures, the adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ).  ASU 2015-02 is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  This ASU simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of consolidation models and improves current GAAP by (1) placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest; (2) reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a VIE; and (3) changing consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs.  Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  The Company adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-02, effective January 31, 2016.  The adoption did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items  ( ASU 2015-01 ).  ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items.  Under the previous practice, an entity was required to separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions.  The FASB issued this ASU as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards.  This ASU will also align more closely U.S. GAAP income statement presentation guidance with IAS 1,  Presentation of Financial Statements,  which prohibits the presentation and disclosure of extraordinary items.  The Company adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-01, effective January 31, 2016.  The adoption did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite  
  
    37 

Service Period  ( ASU 2014-12 ).  ASU 2014-12 provides specific guidance on this Topic, requiring that performance targets that affect vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.  A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in ASC Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.  This varies from the pr  evious practice, as such provisions were also accounted for as non-vesting restrictions which affect the determination of grant-date fair value and required expense recognition over the requisite service period regardless of whether the performance condition is met.  The Company adopted the amendments of ASU 2014-12 as of January 31, 2016 on a prospective basis.  The adoption did not have an impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the other reports and documents that we have filed or may in the future file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other publicly released materials and statements, both oral and written, that we have made or may make in the future, may contain  forward looking  statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,   as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such disclosures are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby.  These forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance.  All statements herein or therein that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs or expectations, are forward-looking statements.  We generally identify these statements by words or phrases, such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan,   project,   expect,   believe,   intend,   foresee,   forecast,   will,   may,   outlook  or th  e negative version of these words or other similar words or phrases.  These statements discuss, among other things, our strategy, our  Strategic Pillars,  store openings, integration and remodeling, the development, implementation and integration of our e-commerce business, the continued benefit of the  Fit for Growth  process improvements, future financial or operational performance, projected sales for certain periods, same store sales from one period to another, cost savings, results of store closings and restructurings, outcome or impact of pending or threatened litigation, domestic or international developments, amount and allocation of future capital expenditures, growth initiatives, inventory levels, cost of goods, selection and type of merchandise, marketing positions, implementation of safety standards, access to trade credit, future financings, refinancings including exchange offers, debt repayments, estimates regarding future effective tax rates, future interest payments, and other goals and targets and statements of the assumptions underlying or relating to any such statements. 
  These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, among others, the seasonality of our business, competition in t  he retail industry, changes in our product distribution mix and distribution channels, general economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we conduct our business, consumer spending patterns, birth rates, our ability to implement our strategy including implementing initiatives for season, our ability to recognize cost savings, implementation and operation of our new e-commerce platform, marketing strategies, the availability of adequate financing, ability to repatriate cash from our foreign operations, ability to distribute cash from our operating subsidiaries to their parent entities, access to trade credit, changes in consumer preferences, changes in employment legislation, our dependence on key vendors for our merchandise, political and other developments associated with our international operations, costs of goods that we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, domestic and international events affecting the delivery of toys and other products to our stores, product safety issues including product recalls, the existence of adverse litigation, changes in laws that impact our business, our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations, restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements and other risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under Item 1A entitled  RISK FACTORS  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on   March 24, 2016  , and in our other reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, we typically earn a disproportionate part of our annual operating earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal buying patterns and these buying patterns are difficult to forecast with c  ertainty.  These factors should not be construed as exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report.  We believe that all forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions when made; however, we caution that it is impossible to predict actual results or outcomes or the effects of risks, uncertainties or other factors on anticipated results or outcomes and that, accordingly, one should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of subsequent events or developments unless required by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and regulations.  Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from anticipated results or outcomes discussed in any forward-looking statement. 

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk during the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  .  For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A entitled  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  .

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including the principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
  We have ev  aluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and   procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  
    39 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     We are, and in the future may be, involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of business.  The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable.  Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources.  We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable, primarily for the following reasons: (i) many of the relevant legal proceedings are in preliminary stages, and until such proceedings develop further, there is often uncertainty regarding the relevant facts and circumstances at issue and potential liability; and (ii) many of these proceedings involve matters of which the outcomes are inherently difficult to predict.  However, based upon our historical experience with similar matters, we do not expect that any such additional losses would be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the information related to Item 1A entitled  RISK FACTORS  disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  .

Exhibit 31.1  
  CERTIFICATION  
  I, David A. Brandon, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Toys  R  Us, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting, to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
