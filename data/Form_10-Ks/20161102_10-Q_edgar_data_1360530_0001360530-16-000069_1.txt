VITAMIN SHOPPE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   
  1. Basis of Presentation 
  Vitamin Shoppe, Inc. (   VSI   ), is incorporated in the State of Delaware, and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vitamin Shoppe Industries Inc. ( Subsidiary  or  Industries  together with VSI, the  Company ), is a multi-channel specialty retailer and contract manufacturer of nutritional products. Sales of both national brands and our own brands of vitamins, minerals, herbs, specialty supplements, sports nutrition and other health and wellness products ( VMS products ) are made through VSI-operated retail stores and the internet to customers located primarily in the United States. The Company manufactures products for both sales to third parties as well as for the VSI product assortment. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   are unaudited. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 26, 2015   was derived from our audited financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 26, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2016 (the  Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K ). The results of operations for the interim periods should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for the full year.  
  The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. As used herein, the term "Fiscal Year" or "Fiscal" refers to a 52-week or 53-week period, ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year. The results for the three and   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   are each based on 13-week and 39-week periods, respectively.  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Except as noted below, the Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information. 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies and early adoption of ASU 2014-09 is permitted for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is evaluating ASU 2014-09 to determine which transition approach it will utilize and if this guidance will have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 was issued by the FASB to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 will require modified retrospective application at the beginning of our first quarter of Fiscal 2019, but permits adoption in an earlier period.  The Company is evaluating ASU 2016-02 in order to determine the impact of this guidance on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and anticipates this guidance will result in a significant increase to long-term assets and liabilities given we have a significant number of leases. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 addresses simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods

within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2016-09 is permitted. The Company has evaluated ASU 2016-09 and does not expect the impact of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  However, under certain circumstances, this guidance could have an impact on the Company s effective tax rate as changes between tax and book treatment of equity compensation will be recognized in the provision for income taxes beginning in Fiscal 2017.

4. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities

  5. Credit Arrangements 
    
  Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 
    
  On December 9, 2015, the Company issued   $143.8 million   of its   2.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the  Convertible Notes ).  The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of VSI. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2016 until their maturity date of December 1, 2020. The Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date. 
  Prior to July 1, 2020, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under certain circumstances. The Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of   25.1625   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $39.74  .  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, the Company is required to increase, in certain circumstances, the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event including customary conversion rate adjustments in connection with a  make-whole fundamental change  as defined.  Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election.  
  The Company allocated the principal amount of the Convertible Notes between its liability and equity components (see table below). The carrying amount of the liability component was determined by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument of similar credit quality and maturity that did not have the conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the embedded conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the Convertible Notes as a whole. The equity component was recorded to additional  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

paid-in capital and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes over the carrying amount of the liability component was recorded as a debt discount, and is being amortized to interest expense using an effective interest rate of   3.8%   over the term of the Convertible Notes. The Company allocated the total amount of transaction costs incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the Convertible Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as a direct deduction from the liability component of the Convertible Notes, and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through the maturity date. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component of the Convertible Notes in additional paid-in capital. 
  The Convertible Notes consist of the following components (in thousands): 

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions for which it paid an aggregate   $26.4 million  .  In addition, the Company sold warrants for which it received aggregate proceeds of   $13.0 million  .  The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution of the Company s common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes.  However, the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Company s common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant transactions, which is approximately   $52.99   at inception.  As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are recorded in stockholders  equity, are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.  
  The net proceeds from the Convertible Notes and related transactions of   $125.7 million  , net of commissions and offering costs of   $4.6 million  , were used to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock under the Company s share repurchase programs.  Refer to Note 9. Share Repurchase Programs for additional information. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  As of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  , the Company had   $6.0 million   and   $8.0 million   of borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), respectively. 
  Subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maturity date of   October 11, 2018  , the Company may borrow up to   $90.0 million  , with a Company option to increase the facility up to a total of   $150.0 million  . The availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated on the value of certain accounts receivable as well as certain inventory of the Company. The obligations thereunder are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.  Under the Revolving Credit Facility, VSI has guaranteed the Company s obligations, and Industries and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have each guaranteed the obligations of the other respective entities. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for affirmative and negative covenants affecting the Company. The Revolving Credit Facility restricts, among other things, the Company s ability to incur indebtedness, create or permit liens on the Company s assets, declare or pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, consolidate, merge or recapitalize, sell assets, make certain investments,  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

loans or other advances, enter into transactions with affiliates, change our line of business, and restricts the types of hedging activities the Company can enter into. The largest amount outstanding during both the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   $27.0 million  . The unused available line of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility at   September 24, 2016   was   $81.1 million  . 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility   accrue interest, at the Company s option, at the rate per annum based on an  alternative base rate  plus   0.25%   or   0.50%   or the adjusted Eurodollar rate plus   1.25%   or   1.50%  , in each case with the higher spread applicable in the event that the aggregate amount of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds   50%   of the borrowing base availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   1.75%   and   1.44%  , respectively. The commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the   $90.0 million   Revolving Credit Facility was   0.25%   as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  . 
  Interest expense, net for the   three and nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   consists of the following (in thousands): 

6. Stock Based Compensation 
  Equity Incentive Plans     The Company has   two   equity incentive plans that provide stock based compensation to certain directors, officers, consultants and employees of the Company; the   2006   Stock Option Plan (the  2006 Plan ) and the Vitamin Shoppe   2009   Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective April 6, 2012, (the  2009 Plan ). As of   September 24, 2016  , there were   2,077,482   shares available to grant under both plans which includes   160,010   shares currently held by the Company as treasury stock. 
  The following table summarizes restricted shares for the   2009   Plan as of   September 24, 2016   and changes during the   nine   month period then ended: 

The total intrinsic value of restricted shares vested during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , was   $2.7 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes stock options for the   2006   and   2009   Plans as of   September 24, 2016   and changes during the   nine   month period then ended:

     Table of Contents  

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   was   $0.1 million   and during the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   was   $1.0 million  . The cash received from options exercised during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   was   $0.1 million   and during the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   was   $1.3 million  . 
  Stock options granted during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   shall become vested in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date on which such equity grants were awarded. 
  The following table summarizes performance share units for the   2009   Plan as of   September 24, 2016   and changes during the   nine   month period then ended: 

Performance share units granted during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   shall become vested on December 29, 2018 if the performance criteria are achieved.  Performance share units can vest at a range of   25%   to   150%   based on the achievement of pre-established performance targets. 
  The following table summarizes restricted share units for the 2009 Plan as of   September 24, 2016   and changes during the   nine   month period then ended:  

The total intrinsic value of restricted share units vested during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , was   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. 
  Compensation expense attributable to stock based compensation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   was approximately   $1.2 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively, and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   was approximately   $1.2 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively. As of   September 24, 2016  , the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation expense for non-vested stock options, restricted shares, performance share units and restricted share  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

units to be expensed in future periods is   $8.9 million  , and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is   1.8   years. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its historical forfeiture rate since the inception of granting stock based awards. The estimated value of future forfeitures for stock options, restricted shares, performance share units and restricted share units as of   September 24, 2016   is approximately   $0.7 million  . 
  The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options during the   three and nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   was   $7.07   and   $8.21  , respectively. Stock options were not granted during the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  

Treasury Stock     As part of the Company s equity incentive plans, the Company makes required tax payments on behalf of employees as their restricted shares vest. The Company withholds the number of vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to the minimum statutory tax obligation. The shares withheld are recorded as treasury shares. During the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company purchased   39,876   shares in settlement of employees  tax obligations for a total of   $1.2 million  . The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method. These shares are available to grant under the Company s equity incentive plans.  
   
  7. Advertising Costs 
  The costs of advertising for online marketing arrangements, magazines, direct mail and radio are primarily expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was   $5.7 million   and   $5.3 million   for the three months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, and   $18.1 million   and   $16.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  8. Net Income Per Share 
  The Company s basic net income per share excludes the dilutive effect of stock options, unvested restricted shares, unvested performance share units and unvested restricted share units. It is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period divided into net income.  
  Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Stock options, unvested restricted shares, unvested performance share units and unvested restricted share units are included as potential dilutive securities for the periods applicable, using the treasury stock method to the extent dilutive.

     Table of Contents  

The components of the calculation of basic net income per common share and diluted net income per common share are as follows (in thousands except share and per share data):  

Stock options, restricted shares and performance share units for the   three months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   in the amount of   35,106   shares and   90,737   shares, respectively, have been excluded from the above calculation as they were anti-dilutive. Stock options, restricted shares and performance share units for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   in the amount of   15,088   shares and   34,803   shares, respectively, have been excluded from the above calculation as they were anti-dilutive.  
  The Company has the intent and ability to settle the principal portion of its Convertible Notes in cash, and as such, has applied the treasury stock method, which has resulted in the underlying convertible shares being anti-dilutive for the three and   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   as the Company s average stock price was less than the conversion price. Refer to Note 5. Credit Arrangements for additional information on the Convertible Notes.  
   
  9. Share Repurchase Programs 
  The Company s board of directors approved share repurchase programs that enable the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of   $300 million   of its shares of common stock from time to time over   three   year periods ending on   August 4, 2017  ,   May 5, 2018   and   November 22, 2018  , respectively. As of   September 24, 2016  ,   7,665,954   shares have been repurchased for a total of   $259.9 million  . The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock and may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing such shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company repurchased   179,648   and   1,919,132   shares, respectively, which were retired upon repurchase. The total purchase price during the   three and nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   was   $5.0 million   and   $56.0 million  , respectively, with an average repurchase price per share of   $27.83   and   $29.19  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , the Company repurchased   355,021   and   981,353   shares, respectively, which were retired upon repurchase. The total purchase price during the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   was   $12.4 million   and   $38.0 million  , respectively, with an average repurchase price per share of   $35.00   and   $38.69  , respectively. 
   
  10. Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is party to various lawsuits arising from time to time in the normal course of business, some of which are covered by insurance. Although the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

11. Segment Data 
  The Company currently operates   three   business segments, retail, direct and manufacturing. The operating segments are segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which operating results are evaluated regularly by executive management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company's management evaluates segment operating results based on several indicators. The primary key performance indicators are sales and operating income for each segment. The table below represents key financial information for each of the Company's business segments as well as corporate costs. The retail segment primarily includes the Company's retail stores. The retail segment generates revenue primarily through the sale of VMS products through Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements retail stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. The direct segment generates revenue through the sale of VMS products primarily through the Company's websites. The Company's websites offer customers online access to a full assortment of approximately   17,000   SKUs. The manufacturing segment supplies the retail and direct segments, along with various third parties, with finished products for sale. Corporate costs represent all other expenses not allocated to the retail, direct or manufacturing segments which include, but are not limited to: human resources, legal, retail management, direct management, finance, information technology, depreciation (primarily related to assets utilized by the retail and direct business segments as well as corporate assets) and amortization, and various other corporate level activity related expenses. Intercompany sales transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company s segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Fiscal   2015   Form 10-K. The Company has allocated   $165.3 million  ,   $45.3 million   and   $32.6 million   of its recorded goodwill to the retail, direct and manufacturing segments, respectively. The Company does not have identifiable assets separated by segment, with the exception of the identifiable assets of the manufacturing segment which were   $89.9 million   and   $88.4 million   as of   September 24, 2016   and December 26, 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures for the manufacturing segment for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were approximately   $1.9 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively. At   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  , long lived assets of the manufacturing segment were   $59.5 million   and   $60.4 million  , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, for the manufacturing segment during the three months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, for the manufacturing segment during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was approximately   $1.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
  The following table contains key financial information of the Company s business segments (in thousands): 

(1)   Manufacturing loss from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   includes a   $1.4 million   charge for accounts receivable for   one   wholesale customer which were deemed uncollectible.

  12. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The fair value hierarchy requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. 
     The Company s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and its Revolving Credit Facility.  The Company believes that the recorded values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their nature and respective durations. 
  The Company's financial instruments also include its Convertible Notes (in thousands): 

The fair value of the Convertible Notes was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the trading price of the Company s Convertible Notes, when available, the Company s stock price and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to the Company (Level 1 or 2). 
  Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, that is, the assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of impairment. These measures of fair value, and related inputs, are considered Level 2 or 3 measures under the fair value hierarchy.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as part of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
  Company Overview  
  We are a multi-channel specialty retailer and contract manufacturer of vitamins, minerals, herbs, specialty supplements, sports nutrition and other health and wellness products. As of   September 24, 2016  , we operated   774   stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and also sold our products directly to consumers through the internet, primarily at www.vitaminshoppe.com. We market approximately 880 nationally recognized brands as well as our own brands, which include The Vitamin Shoppe , BodyTech , True Athlete , Mytrition , plnt , ProBioCare , Next Step  and Betancourt Nutrition . We believe we offer one of the largest varieties of products among vitamin, mineral and supplement ( VMS ) retailers and continue to refine our assortment with approximately 7,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs") offered in our typical store and approximately 10,000 additional SKUs available through e-commerce. Our broad product offering enables us to provide our customers with a depth of selection of products that may not be readily available at other specialty retailers or mass merchants, such as discount stores, supermarkets, drugstores and wholesale clubs. We believe our product offering and emphasis on product knowledge and customer service helps us meet the needs of our target customer and serves as a foundation for enhancing customer loyalty. 
  During Fiscal 2015, the Company began development of a strategic plan focused on upgrading our customers  experience across our retail and e-commerce channels, the  reinvention strategy .  We worked with outside consultants to analyze qualitative and quantitative information relevant to our customers  experience. The reinvention strategy is focused on upgrading the customer experience to inspire our target customers with changes to curate our product assortment, opportunities to increase private brands penetration, enhancements to the in-store and digital experience, store layout, as well as changes to improve the effectiveness of our loyalty program. Such changes may result in a reduction of SKUs offered by the Company which could result in the recognition of related inventory charges in future periods.  We expect to incur approximately $10.0 million of selling, general and administrative costs during Fiscal 2016 in connection with the reinvention, of which approximately $6.0 million of such costs are expected to be on-going.  These costs include additional internal resources, improvements to store network connectivity, and outside consultants.  During the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016, we incurred $2.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, of costs to implement the reinvention.  The Company is in the process of testing several initiatives and expects to realize improved financial results from the reinvention beginning in Fiscal 2017.  In addition, we have engaged a consulting firm in Fiscal 2016 to identify other efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities focusing on product sourcing, store operations and corporate expenses.  During the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016, we incurred $2.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of costs in connection with identifying other efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities.  As a result of this cost reduction project, we have identified savings potential with an additional estimated value of at least $10.0 million on an annualized basis. 
  In Fiscal 2015, we also performed a review of certain business operations. As part of this review, we implemented changes to the product assortment and supply chain operations of Super Supplements to more closely align Super Supplements with current processes and assortments in the Vitamin Shoppe retail stores. As a result, net costs of $1.0 million were incurred during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.  Annual cost savings resulting from these actions are estimated to be $1 million to $2 million.  In addition, the Company decided to cease operations in Canada, closing one store in the first quarter and closing the remaining two stores in the second quarter of Fiscal 2016.  During the nine months ended September 24, 2016, net costs of $1.9 million were incurred in connection with ceasing operations in Canada which includes a reversal of lease liabilities during the three months ended September 24, 2016 of $0.9 million relating to lease liabilities previously accrued.  The annual cost savings in connection with ceasing operations in Canada are estimated to be approximately $1.0 million.  Costs for these two initiatives include lease liabilities, markdown charges on inventory and employee severance. 
  Since the acquisition in Fiscal 2014, Nutri-Force has experienced disruption in its ability to optimize production capacity, volatility in sales performance, and correspondingly has experienced lower service levels to customers. We continue to take steps to improve the operations at Nutri-Force, including improvements in operating efficiencies and the ability to transition additional Vitamin Shoppe branded products. We believe such disruptions should not impact the long-term opportunity from the Nutri-Force acquisition. However, based upon the operating results of Nutri-Force during the three months ended June 25, 2016, we concluded that an impairment trigger occurred for the manufacturing reporting unit and therefore an impairment test was performed. A discounted cash flow model was prepared using the most recent internal forecast, including an estimate of long-term future growth rates and a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in this forecast. The results of this analysis determined the fair value of the manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and as a result, we concluded the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit was not  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

impaired. However, the fair value of the manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%, which is not considered to be a substantial excess over the carrying value.  While financial results during the three months ended September 24, 2016 did not improve, we continue to closely monitor the financial performance of Nutri-Force and are currently in the process of developing the annual and long-term operating plans for Nutri-Force.  Should financial performance not improve or if growth expectations are not achieved, estimates of future cash flows may be insufficient to support the carrying value of goodwill of $32.6 million assigned to Nutri-Force as of September 24, 2016, which may result in impairment charges in future periods. 
  Highlights for the   Third   Quarter of Fiscal 2016 
             
    Net sales were flat compared to the same period of the prior year 

Total comparable net sales decreased 1.9% 

Comparable store net sales decreased 2.3% 

Comparable e-commerce net sales increased 1.7% 

Fully diluted earnings per share of   $0.48    
     Outlook for Fiscal 2016 
  Management expects the following for Fiscal 2016, on a 53-week basis: 
             
    Total comparable net sales growth expected to be flat to slightly negative 
                 
    Capital expenditures of approximately $40 million 
     Segment Information  
  We operate through three business segments: retail, which includes Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements retail store formats, direct, which consists of our e-commerce and catalog formats, and manufacturing, which consists of the Nutri-Force manufacturing operations. 
  Retail.   Through our retail store formats, we believe we differentiate ourselves in the VMS industry, which has been successful across geographic and demographic markets. What makes us unique is our broad selection of VMS products and our stores are staffed with trained and knowledgeable employees, who we refer to as Health Enthusiasts , and who are able to inform our customers about product features and assist in product selection. 
  Direct.   We also sell our products directly to consumers through the internet, primarily at   www.vitaminshoppe.com  . Our e-commerce sites complement our in-store experience by extending our retail product offerings with approximately 10,000 additional SKUs that are not available in our stores and enable us to access customers outside our retail markets and those who prefer to shop online. 
  Manufacturing.   Through Nutri-Force, we provide custom manufacturing and private labeling of VMS products and develop and market our own branded products for both sales to third parties and for the VSI product assortment. 
  Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business  
  Our performance is affected by industry trends including, among others, demographic, health and lifestyle preferences, as well as other factors, such as industry media coverage and governmental actions. For example, our industry is subject to potential regulatory activity and other legal matters that could affect the credibility of a given product or category of products. Consumer trends, the overall impact on consumer spending, which may be affected heavily by current economic conditions, and limited product innovation and introductions in the VMS industry can dramatically affect purchasing patterns. Even though our business model allows us to respond to changing industry trends by introducing new products and adjusting our product mix and sales incentives, such actions may not offset adverse trends. Additionally, our performance is affected by competitive trends such as the entry and expansion of competitors, changes in promotional strategies or expansion of product assortment by various competitors.  
  Our historical results have also been significantly influenced by our new store openings. Since the beginning of Fiscal  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

2014, we have opened 134 stores and as of   September 24, 2016   operate   774   stores located in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In Fiscal 2016, we have reduced the number of new store openings as we continue to evaluate and implement our reinvention strategy. We expect to open 27 new stores in Fiscal 2016, of which 23 were opened during the nine months ended September 24, 2016. 
  New stores have typically required approximately four to five years to mature, generating lower store level sales in the initial years than our mature stores. As a result, new stores generally have a negative impact on our overall operating margin. In addition, our new stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2013 are approximately 2,900 square feet compared to the average of our total store portfolio of approximately 3,500 square feet. Additionally, stores opened in new markets have lower brand awareness compared to stores in existing markets, and as a result initially experience a lower sales volume than stores opened in existing markets. As these stores mature, we expect them to contribute positively to our operating results. 
  In Fiscal 2015, the Company began implementation of a new warehouse management system application ( WMS ) at its Ashland, Virginia distribution center in order to realize further productivity improvements and functionality.  Implementation of the new WMS is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016. In addition, we are developing plans to open a distribution center in the western U.S. within the next two years. We previously utilized a third-party logistics provider to service the west coast, and plan to open a Company operated facility that we believe will provide improved service levels and network efficiencies. 
  Critical Accounting Policies  
  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our financial statements in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. Management has discussed the development and selection of these policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed the disclosures relating to them. Management believes there have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies or estimates reported in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. 
  General Definitions for Operating Results  
  Net Sales   consist of sales, net of sales returns, deferred sales, customer incentives and a provision for estimated future returns, from comparable and non-comparable sales. Total comparable net sales include sales generated by retail stores and e-commerce sales in both reporting periods.  Sales generated by retail stores after 410 days of operation are included in comparable net sales. Sales to third parties of manufactured products generated by Nutri-Force are considered non-comparable sales. 
  Cost of goods sold   includes the cost of inventory sold, costs of warehousing, distribution, manufacturing and store occupancy costs and excludes depreciation and amortization related to the retail and direct segments that is included within selling, general and administrative expenses. Warehousing, distribution and manufacturing costs, which are capitalized into inventory and then expensed as merchandise is sold, include freight to transfer merchandise, costs associated with our buying department, distribution facilities and manufacturing overhead. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes and utilities. 
  Gross profit   is net sales minus cost of goods sold. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   consist of depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets, operating payroll and related benefits, advertising and promotion expense, and other selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Income from operations   consists of gross profit minus selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Interest expense, net   includes interest on our Revolving Credit Facility and Convertible Notes, letters of credit fees, interest on our capital leases, as well as amortization of financing costs, reduced by interest income earned from highly liquid investments (investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less).

     Table of Contents  

The following tables summarize our results of operations for the three months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   (in thousands): 

Net Sales 
  Net sales were flat as a result of an increase in our total non-comparable net sales of $6.6 million, which includes an increase in Nutri-Force net sales of $1.4 million to third parties, and a decrease in our total comparable net sales of $5.6 million, or 1.9%. Sales increased $2.7 million in the Specialty Supplements category, which includes whole foods, cleansing and digestive supplements and increased $2.5 million in the Vitamins, Minerals and Herbs category. Sales decreased $5.8 million in the Sports Nutrition category. 
  Net sales for our three business segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each segment's net sales from the comparable prior year period, are provided below (in thousands): 

(a) 
    The change in retail sales resulted from an increase in non-comparable store sales of $6.6 million offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $6.1 million, or 2.3%. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a reduction in average transaction value resulting from product category mix. 
              (b) 
    Direct sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in non-comparable e-commerce net sales as a result of the closure of the Super Supplements on-line storefront and lower catalog sales totaling $1.4 million partially offset by an increase in comparable e-commerce net sales of $0.5 million, or 1.7%. 
              (c) 
    Manufacturing sales reflect an increase of $2.3 million in product manufactured for the Vitamin Shoppe assortment and an increase of $1.4 million in product manufactured for third parties.

     Table of Contents  

Cost of Goods Sold 
  Cost of goods sold includes product, warehouse, distribution, manufacturing and occupancy costs.  As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased primarily due to an increase of 0.6% related to occupancy, an increase of 0.5% due to Nutri-Force and an increase of 0.4% resulting from supply chain costs partially offset by a 0.5% increase in product margin, which is primarily the result of less promotional activity. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

(a) 
    Store payroll and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in head count to operate new stores and an increase in the average wage rates. 
              (b) 
    Advertising and promotion increased due to higher retail expenditures partially offset by lower expenditures related to Nutri-Force and digital advertising. 
              (c) 
    Other SG A expenses for the three month period ended September 24, 2016 includes consulting costs in connection with identifying efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities of $2.3 million and a reversal of lease liabilities previously accrued related to the closing of the Canada stores of $0.9 million.  Other SG A expenses for the three month period ended September 26, 2015 includes consultants fees in connection with the Company's "reinvention strategy" of $1.0 million and integration costs related to the acquisition of Nutri-Force of $0.6 million. 
       
  Income from Operations 
  Operating income (loss) for our three business segments are provided below (in thousands): 

(a) 
    The decrease in retail income from operations as a rate of sales is due to a 0.4% increase from store payroll and benefits costs, a 0.3% decrease in gross margin and a 0.2% increase in advertising and promotion costs. 
     
   23 

     Table of Contents  

(b) 
    The decrease in direct income from operations is primarily due to a reduction in operating margin generated by on-line marketplaces and from an increase in promotional pricing and delivery expense. 
              (c) 
    The increase in manufacturing loss from operations was primarily due to operational inefficiencies. 
              (d) 
    Corporate costs for the three month period ended September 24, 2016 includes consulting costs in connection with identifying efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities of $2.3 million and a reversal of lease liabilities previously accrued related to the closing of the Canada stores of $0.9 million.  Corporate costs for the three month period ended September 26, 2015 includes consultants fees in connection with the Company's "reinvention strategy" of $1.0 million and integration costs related to the acquisition of Nutri-Force of $0.6 million. 
       
  Interest Expense, Net 
  The increase in interest expense, net of   $2.2 million   is primarily due to interest expense on our Convertible Notes, which includes the coupon interest, amortization of the debt discount and the amortization of deferred financing fees. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 24, 2016   was   36.6%  , compared to   39.2%   for the three months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reversal of lease liabilities previously accrued of $0.9 million in connection with the closing of retail stores in Canada which do not result in tax expense to the Company s consolidated results. 
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 24, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 26, 2015    
  The information presented below is for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   and was derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for such periods and as of such dates.

  Net sales increased 1.2% as a result of an increase in our total non-comparable net sales of $18.1 million offset by a decrease in our total comparable net sales of $4.9 million, or 0.5% and a decrease in Nutri-Force net sales of $1.8 million to third parties. Sales increased $11.7 million in the Specialty Supplements category, which includes whole foods, cleansing and digestive supplements and increased $10.8 million in the Vitamins, Minerals and Herbs category. Sales decreased $12.3 million in the Sports Nutrition category.

     Table of Contents  

Net sales for our three business segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each segment's net sales from the comparable prior year period, are provided below (in thousands): 

(a) 
    The change in retail sales resulted from an increase in non-comparable store sales of $21.9 million offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $11.2 million, or 1.4%. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a reduction in average transaction value resulting from product category mix. 
              (b) 
    Direct sales increased primarily due to an increase in comparable e-commerce sales of $6.3 million, or 6.8% offset by a decrease in non-comparable e-commerce net sales and lower catalog sales totaling $3.8 million. The increase in comparable e-commerce sales was primarily due to effective customer acquisition and promotional activities. 
              (c) 
    Manufacturing sales reflect a decrease of $1.8 million in product manufactured for third parties offset by an increase of $0.4 million in product manufactured for the Vitamin Shoppe assortment. 
       
  Cost of Goods Sold 
  Cost of goods sold includes product, warehouse, distribution, manufacturing and occupancy costs.  As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased primarily due to an increase of 0.4% related to occupancy, an increase of 0.3% due to Nutri-Force and an increase of 0.2% resulting from supply chain costs partially offset by a 0.4% increase in product margin. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

(a) 
    Store payroll and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in head count to operate new stores and an increase in the average wage rates. 
              (b) 
    Advertising and promotion increased due to higher retail expenditures and digital advertising partially offset by lower expenditures related to Nutri-Force. 
              (c) 
    Other SG A expenses for the nine month period ended September 24, 2016 includes consulting costs in connection with identifying efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities of $3.8 million, costs related to the closing of the Canada stores of $2.1 million, Super Supplements conversion costs of $1.3 million and consultants fees in connection with the Company's "reinvention strategy" of $0.5 million.  Other SG A expenses for the nine month period ended September 26, 2015 includes management realignment charges of $2.2 million, a charge for accounts receivable for one  
     
   25 

     Table of Contents  

wholesale customer which were deemed uncollectible of $1.4 million, integration costs related to the acquisition of Nutri-Force of $1.4 million and consultants fees in connection with the Company's "reinvention strategy" of $1.0 million. 
    
  Income from Operations 
  Operating income (loss) for our three business segments are provided below (in thousands): 

(a) 
    The decrease in retail income from operations as a rate of sales is due to 0.4% from store payroll and benefits costs, 0.1% related to advertising and promotion costs and 0.1% resulting from other selling, general and administrative expenses. 
              (b) 
    The decrease in direct income from operations is primarily due to a reduction in operating margin generated by on-line marketplaces and from an increase in promotional pricing and delivery expense. 
              (c) 
    The increase in manufacturing loss from operations was primarily due to lower sales to third party customers and operational inefficiencies. The nine month period ended September 26, 2015 includes a $1.4 million charge for accounts receivable for one wholesale customer which were deemed uncollectible. 
              (d) 
    Corporate costs for the nine month period ended September 24, 2016 includes consulting costs in connection with identifying efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities of $3.8 million, costs related to the closing of the Canada stores of $2.1 million, Super Supplements conversion costs of $1.3 million and consultants fees in connection with the Company's "reinvention strategy" of $0.5 million.  Corporate costs for the nine month period ended September 26, 2015 includes management realignment charges of $2.2 million, integration costs related to the acquisition of Nutri-Force of $1.4 million and consultants fees in connection with the Company's "reinvention strategy" of $1.0 million. 
       
  Interest Expense, Net 
  The increase in interest expense, net of   $6.5 million   is primarily due to interest expense on our Convertible Notes, which includes the coupon interest, amortization of the debt discount and the amortization of deferred financing fees. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   was   40.3%  , compared to   39.2%   for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to charges incurred in Canada related to the closing of retail stores which do not result in tax benefits to the Company s consolidated results.

Key Indicators of Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  The following table provides key indicators of our liquidity and capital resources (in thousands): 

(a) Working capital is total current assets minus total current liabilities. 
  (b) Total debt includes the outstanding balance on the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, the net balance of its Convertible Notes and its capital lease obligations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Our primary uses of cash have been to fund working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures related primarily to the build-out of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores and information technology investments as well as to repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, we have financed our requirements predominately through internally generated cash flow, supplemented with short-term financing.  In Fiscal 2015, we issued   $143.8 million   of Convertible Notes to fund the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Refer to Note 5.,  Credit Arrangements , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that the cash generated by operations and cash and cash equivalents, together with the borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months, our store growth plans, costs and investments related to our reinvention strategy, systems development, store improvements and interest payments on the Convertible Notes, as well as the repurchase of shares of our common stock from time to time. 
  We purchased   $56.0 million   of common stock under our   $300.0 million   share repurchase programs during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  . Refer to Note 9.,  Share Repurchase Programs , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. During Fiscal 2016 we plan to spend approximately $40 million in capital expenditures, including costs for building new stores, remodeling existing stores and information technology and investments resulting from our reinvention strategy. Of the total capital expenditures projected for Fiscal 2016, we have invested   $31.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  . We expect to open 27 new stores in Fiscal 2016, of which we have opened   23   stores and closed   7   stores as of   September 24, 2016  . Our working capital requirements for merchandise inventory will continue to increase as we continue to open additional stores. Currently, our practice is to establish an inventory level of approximately $145,000 at cost for each of our stores, the cost of which is partially offset by vendor incentive and allowance programs. Additionally, 30 day payment terms have been extended to us by some of our suppliers allowing us to effectively manage our inventory and working capital. 
  The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents, and at times holds  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

cash balances in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Currently, the Company s cash management practice is to hold cash balances in quality institutions and invest in highly liquid and secure investments. 
  We were in compliance with all covenants relating to our Revolving Credit Facility and Convertible Notes as of   September 24, 2016  . We expect to be in compliance with these same debt covenants during the remainder of Fiscal 2016 as well. 
  Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $78.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   as compared to   $56.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The   $21.4 million   increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases for the nine months ended September 26, 2015 related primarily to the transition of Vitamin Shoppe production of private brands to Nutri-Force and the opening of new stores. 
  Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $31.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   as compared to   $30.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .  Capital expenditures during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were used primarily for the build-out of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores and information technology investments. The Company opened   23   new stores during the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   as compared to   39   new stores during the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
  Cash Used in Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $59.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  , as compared to   $36.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The   $23.0 million   increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an increase in purchases of common stock under the Company's share repurchase programs. 
  Revolving Credit Facility  
  The terms of our Revolving Credit Facility extend through October 11, 2018, and allow the Company to borrow up to $90.0 million, subject to the terms of the facility, with a Company option to increase the facility up to a total of $150.0 million. For information regarding the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility, refer to Note 5.,  Credit Arrangements  in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited).  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had   $6.0 million   of borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility. The largest amount outstanding during both the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   $27.0 million  .  The unused available line of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility at   September 24, 2016   was   $81.1 million  .   
  Convertible Notes 
  On December 9, 2015, the Company issued   $143.8 million   of its 2.25% Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of VSI. Interest is payable on the Convertible Notes on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2016 until their maturity date of December 1, 2020.  For additional information regarding the terms of our Convertible Notes, refer to Note 5., "Credit Arrangements", to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  
  As of   September 24, 2016  , there have been no material changes with respect to our contractual obligations since December 26, 2015. For additional information, see Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The Company has commitments for its operating leases, primarily related to its stores, distribution centers, as well as its manufacturing and corporate facilities, which are not reflected on our balance sheet. For additional information, see Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Fiscal 2015 10-K.

Effects of Inflation 
  We do not believe that our sales or operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the periods presented in our financial statements. During the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  , retail price inflation was approximately 1%. We anticipate retail inflation to be approximately 1% for Fiscal 2016. Additionally, we may experience increased cost pressure from our suppliers which could have an adverse effect on our gross profit results in the future.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  Except as discussed in Note 1.,  Basis of Presentation  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited), the Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information. 
   
  Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. 
  Our Revolving Credit Facility carries a floating interest rate and, therefore, our statements of income and our cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates. As of   September 24, 2016  , there was   $6.0 million   of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility.  At   September 24, 2016  , a hypothetical 10% change in the floating interest rate would have a de minimis impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Our Convertible Notes carry a fixed interest rate and, therefore, have no market risk. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules l3a-15(e) and l5d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) as of   September 24, 2016  , pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-l5 and 15d-15. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of   September 24, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 24, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
