A.                              Financial Statements 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, these statements include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of EQT Corporation and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of its operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and its cash flows for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to  we,   us,   our,   EQT,   EQT Corporation,  and the  Company  refer collectively to EQT Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The impact of these reclassifications was not material to any of the previously issued financial statements.   
    
  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States GAAP for complete financial statements. 
    
  On May 2, 2016, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriters), under which the Company sold to the Underwriters   10,500,000   shares of the Company's common stock, no par value (common stock), at a price to the public of   $67.00   per share (the May Offering). On May 3, 2016, the Underwriters exercised their option within the Underwriting Agreement to purchase an additional   1,575,000   shares of common stock on the same terms. The May Offering closed on May 6, 2016, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $795.6 million   after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the May Offering to fund the Statoil Acquisition discussed in Note N, and intends to use the remainder to fund the acquisitions discussed in Note O and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Goldman, Sachs   Co. (Goldman) under which the Company sold to Goldman   6,500,000   shares of common stock, at a price to the public of   $58.50   per share (the February Offering). On February 22, 2016, Goldman exercised its option within the Underwriting Agreement to purchase an additional   975,000   shares of common stock on the same terms. The February Offering closed on February 24, 2016, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $430.4 million  , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the February Offering for general corporate purposes. 
    
  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as well as  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  beginning on page 23 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

B.                              EQT GP Holdings, LP 
    
  In January 2015, the Company formed EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP) (NYSE:  EQGP), a Delaware limited partnership, to own the Company's partnership interests in EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) (NYSE: EQM). EQGP owned the following EQM partnership interests as of   September 30, 2016  , which represent EQGP s only cash-generating assets:    21,811,643   EQM common units, representing a   26.6%   limited partner interest in EQM;   1,443,015   EQM general partner units, representing a   1.8%   general partner interest in EQM; and all of EQM s incentive distribution rights, or IDRs, which entitle EQGP to receive up to   48.0%   of all incremental cash distributed in a quarter after   $0.5250   has been distributed in respect of each common unit and general partner unit of EQM for that quarter. The Company is the ultimate parent company of EQGP and EQM. 
    
  On May 15, 2015, EQGP completed an underwritten initial public offering (IPO) of   26,450,000   common units representing limited partner interests in EQGP, which represented   9.9%   of EQGP s outstanding limited partner interests. The Company retained   239,715,000   common units, which represented a   90.1%   limited partner interest, and a non-economic general partner interest in EQGP. EQT Gathering Holdings, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was the selling unitholder and sold all of the EQGP common units in the offering. The IPO resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately   $674.0 million   after deducting the underwriters' discount of approximately   $37.5 million   and structuring fees of approximately   $2.7 million  . EQGP did not receive any of the proceeds from, or incur any expenses in connection with, the IPO.

  EQT Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  

The Company continues to consolidate the results of EQGP, but records an income tax provision only as to its ownership percentage.  The Company records the noncontrolling interest of the EQGP and EQM public limited partners (i.e., the EQGP limited partner interests not owned by the Company and the EQM limited partner interests not owned by EQGP) in its financial statements.  
    
  On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of EQGP s general partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP s unitholders for the   third   quarter of 2016 of   $0.165   per common unit, or approximately   $43.9 million  .  The distribution will be paid on November 22, 2016 to unitholders of record, including the Company, at the close of business on November 4, 2016. 

C.                              EQT Midstream Partners, LP 
    
  In January 2012, the Company formed EQM to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQM provides midstream services to the Company and other third parties.  EQM is consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company records the noncontrolling interest of the EQM public limited partners (i.e., the EQM limited partner interests not owned by EQGP) in its financial statements. 
    
  On March 30, 2015, the Company assigned   100%   of the membership interest in MVP Holdco, LLC (MVP Holdco), which at the time was its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, to EQM and received   $54.2 million  , which represented EQM's reimbursement to EQT of   100%   of the capital contributions made by EQT to Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP Joint Venture) as of March 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, MVP Holdco owned a   45.5%   interest (MVP Interest) in the MVP Joint Venture. The MVP Joint Venture plans to construct the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), an estimated   300  -mile natural gas interstate pipeline spanning from northern West Virginia to southern Virginia. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of    2.0   Bcf per day of   20  -year firm capacity commitments, including a   1.29   Bcf per day firm capacity commitment by the Company. The MVP project is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP certificate application to the FERC in October 2015, and the FERC issued the Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review (NOS) and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on June 28, 2016 and September 16, 2016, respectively.  Based on the schedule provided in the NOS, the MVP Joint Venture anticipates receiving the certificate in mid-year 2017. The pipeline is targeted to be in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
    
  During 2015, EQM entered into an equity distribution agreement that established an  At the Market  (ATM) common unit offering program, pursuant to which a group of managers, acting as EQM s sales agents, may sell EQM common units having an aggregate offering price of up to   $750 million   (the   $750 million   ATM Program).  During the second quarter of 2016, EQM issued   2,949,309   common units at an average price per unit of   $74.42   under this program and received net proceeds of   $217.1 million   after deducting commissions of   $2.2 million   and other offering expenses of   $0.2 million  . EQM used the net proceeds for general partnership purposes. In connection with the sales during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a   $24.9 million   gain to additional paid-in-capital, a decrease in noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiary of   $39.9 million   and an increase to deferred tax liability of $  15.0 million  .    No   ATM sales occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of EQM s general partner declared a cash distribution to EQM s unitholders for the   third   quarter of 2016 of   $0.815   per common unit. The cash distribution will be paid on November 14, 2016 to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on November 4, 2016. Based on the   80,581,758   EQM common units outstanding on October 27, 2016, the aggregate cash distributions by EQM to EQGP will be approximately   $44.3 million   consisting of:    $17.8 million   in respect of its limited partner interest,   $1.6 million   in respect of its general partner interest and   $24.9 million   in respect of its IDRs.  However, the distributions to EQGP in respect of its general partner interest and IDRs in EQM are subject to change if EQM issues additional common units on or prior to the record date for the   third   quarter 2016 distribution.

D.        Equity in Nonconsolidated Investments 
    
  The Company, through its ownership interest in EQM, has a noncontrolling ownership interest in the MVP Joint Venture, a nonconsolidated investment that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The following table summarizes the Company's equity in the nonconsolidated investment: 

The Company s ownership share of the earnings for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the total investments accounted for under the equity method was   $2.7 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. The Company s ownership share of the earnings for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the total investments accounted for under the equity method was   $6.1 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively. These earnings are reported in other income on the Statements of Consolidated Operations for the periods presented. 
    
  The MVP Joint Venture has been determined to be a variable interest entity because the MVP Joint Venture has insufficient equity to finance activities during the construction stage of the project. EQM is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities of the MVP Joint Venture that most significantly impact its economic performance. Certain business decisions, including, but not limited to: decisions with respect to operating and construction budgets, project construction schedule, material contracts or precedent agreements, indebtedness, significant acquisitions or dispositions, material regulatory filings and strategic decisions, require the approval of owners holding more than a 66 2/3% interest in the MVP Joint Venture and no one member owns more than a 66 2/3% interest. 
    
  On January 21, 2016, affiliates of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ConEd) acquired a   12.5%   interest in the MVP Joint Venture and entered into   20  -year firm capacity commitments for approximately   0.25   Bcf per day on both the MVP and EQM s transmission system (ConEd Transaction). As a result of the ConEd Transaction, EQM s interest in the MVP Joint Venture decreased by   8.5%     to   45.5%  , and during the first quarter of 2016 ConEd reimbursed EQM   $12.5 million  , which represented EQM's proportional capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture through the date of the transaction. ConEd has the right to terminate its purchase of the interest in the MVP Joint Venture and be reimbursed for the purchase price and all capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture for a period ending no later than December 31, 2016. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM had issued a   $91 million   performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP. Upon the FERC s initial release to begin construction of the MVP, EQM's guarantee will terminate; EQM will then be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to   33%   of MVP Holdco s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by any affiliate of EQM under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the MVP Joint Venture.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM's maximum financial statement exposure related to the MVP Joint Venture was approximately   $251 million  , which included the investment balance of   $160 million   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and amounts which could have become due under the performance guarantee as of that date.  

E.     Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
    
  The Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2015-02,   Consolidation   in the first quarter of 2016 and, as a result, EQT determined EQGP and EQM to be variable interest entities. Through EQT's ownership and control of EQGP's general partner and control of EQM's general partner, EQT has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. In addition, through EQT's general partner interest and limited partner interest in EQGP and EQGP's general partner interest, limited partner interest and IDRs in EQM, EQT has the obligation to absorb the losses of EQGP and EQM and the right to receive benefits from EQGP and EQM, in accordance with such interests. Therefore, EQT has a controlling financial interest in EQGP and EQM, is the primary beneficiary of EQGP and EQM and consolidates EQGP and EQM.

The risks associated with the operations of EQGP and EQM are discussed in their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. See further discussion of the impact that EQT's involvement in EQGP and EQM have on EQT's financial position, results of operations and cash flows included in EQT's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , including in the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained therein. See Notes B and C for further discussion of EQGP and EQM, respectively. 
    
  The following table presents amounts included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that were for the use or obligation of EQGP or EQM as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The following table summarizes EQGP's Statements of Consolidated Operations and Cash Flows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , inclusive of affiliate amounts.  

F.                              Financial Information by Business Segment 
    
  Operating segments are revenue-producing components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and which are subject to evaluation by the Company s chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. 
    
  The Company reports its operations in   two   segments, which reflect its lines of business.  The EQT Production segment includes the Company s exploration for, development and production of and sales of, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) in the Appalachian and Permian Basins.  The EQT Midstream segment s operations include the natural gas gathering, transmission and storage activities of the Company, including ownership and operation of EQGP and EQM. EQT Midstream also provides marketing services for the benefit of EQT Production.

  EQT Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  

Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Company s consolidated results based on operating income. Other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters  costs are billed to the operating segments based upon an allocation of the headquarters  annual operating budget.  Differences between budget and actual headquarters  expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. 
    
  Substantially all of the Company s operating revenues, income from operations and assets are generated or located in the United States. 

(a) 
    For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,  EQT Production presented affiliated gathering and transmission costs as operating expenses for consistency with the presentation of third-party costs.  Historically, these affiliated costs have been presented as revenue deductions.  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

G.                              Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and NGLs, which can affect the operating results of the Company primarily at EQT Production.  The Company s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. 
    
  The Company uses over the counter (OTC) derivative commodity instruments, primarily swap and collar agreements, that are primarily placed with financial institutions. The creditworthiness of all counterparties is regularly monitored. Swap agreements involve payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity. Collar agreements require the counterparty to pay the Company if the index price falls below the floor price and the Company to pay the counterparty if the index price rises above the cap price. The Company also sells call options that require the Company to pay the counterparty if the index price rises above the strike price. The Company engages in basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices and interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on potential debt issuances. 
    
  The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on a gross basis. These derivative 
  instruments are reported as either current assets or current liabilities due to their highly liquid nature. The Company can net settle its derivative instruments at any time. 
    
  The accounting for the changes in fair value of the Company s derivative instruments depends on the use of the derivative instruments.  To the extent that a derivative instrument had been designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, and is subsequently reclassified into the Statements of Consolidated Operations in the same period or periods during which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. As a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting, beginning in 2015, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivative instruments are recognized within operating revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. 
    
  In prior periods, derivative commodity instruments used by the Company to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows associated with the fluctuations in the price of natural gas related to the Company s forecasted sale of EQT Production's produced volumes and forecasted natural gas purchases and sales were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges.    As of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company deferred net gains of   $21.7 million   and   $64.8 million  , respectively, in accumulated OCI, net of tax, related to the effective portion of the change in fair value of its derivative commodity instruments designated as cash flow hedges.  Effective December 31, 2014, the Company elected to de-designate all cash flow hedges and discontinue the use of cash flow hedge accounting.    As of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the forecasted transactions that were hedged as of December 31, 2014 remained probable of occurring and as such, the amounts in accumulated OCI will continue to be reported in accumulated OCI and will be reclassified into earnings in future periods when the underlying hedged transactions occur.  The forecasted transactions extend through December 2018. The Company estimates that approximately   $15.6 million   of net gains on its derivative commodity instruments reflected in accumulated OCI, net of tax, as of   September 30, 2016   will be recognized in earnings during the next twelve months due to the settlement of hedged transactions. 
    
  The Company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery.  These physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception and are not subject to derivative instrument accounting. 
    
  OTC arrangements require settlement in cash. Settlements of derivative commodity instruments are reported as a component of cash flows from operations in the accompanying Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows.

The absolute quantities of the Company s derivative commodity instruments totaled   677   Bcf and   676   Bcf as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and were primarily related to natural gas swaps, basis swaps and collars. The open natural gas positions at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   had maturities extending through December 2020 and December 2019, respectively. The Company also had   913   Mbbls of propane swaps as of September 30, 2016, which had maturities extending through December 2018. 
    
  The Company has netting agreements with financial institutions and its brokers that permit net settlement of gross commodity derivative assets against gross commodity derivative liabilities. The table below reflects the impact of netting agreements and margin deposits on gross derivative assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Certain of the Company s derivative instrument contracts provide that if the Company s credit ratings by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services (S P) or Moody s Investors Services (Moody s) are lowered below investment grade, additional collateral may be required to be deposited with the counterparty.  The additional collateral can be up to   100%   of the derivative liability.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was   $8.0 million  , for which the Company had   no   collateral posted on   September 30, 2016  .  If the Company s credit rating by S P or Moody s had been downgraded below investment grade on   September 30, 2016  , the Company would not have been required to post any additional collateral under the agreements with the respective counterparties.  Investment grade refers to the quality of the Company s credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. The Company s senior unsecured debt was rated BBB by S P and Baa3 by Moody s at   September 30, 2016  .  In order to be considered investment grade, the Company must be rated BBB- or higher by S P and Baa3 or higher by Moody s. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade. Having a non-investment grade rating would result in greater borrowing costs and collateral requirements than would be available if all credit ratings were investment grade. See also "Security Ratings and Financing Triggers" under Part I, Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

H.                  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Company records its financial instruments, principally derivative instruments, at fair value in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company estimates the fair value using quoted market prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use market-based parameters as inputs, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk.  Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Company s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty s credit standing on the fair value of assets.  The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Company s or counterparty s credit rating and the yield of a risk-free instrument and credit default swaps rates where available.   
    
  The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  Assets and liabilities in Level 2 primarily include the Company s swap and collar agreements. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the periods presented. The Company recognizes transfers between Levels as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
    
  The fair value of the commodity swaps included in Level 2 is based on standard industry income approach models that use significant observable inputs, including New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) forward curves, LIBOR-based discount rates, basis forward curves and propane forward curves.  The Company s collars and options are valued using standard industry income approach option models.  The significant observable inputs utilized by the option pricing models include NYMEX forward curves, natural gas volatilities and LIBOR-based discount rates. The NYMEX forward curves, LIBOR-based discount rates, natural gas volatilities, basis forward curves and propane forward curves are validated to external sources at least monthly. 
    
  The following assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the applicable period:

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, amounts due to/from related parties and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of borrowings under EQM s credit facility approximates fair value as the interest rates are based on prevailing market rates.  
    
  The Company estimates the fair value of its debt using its established fair value methodology.  Because not all of the Company s debt is actively traded, the fair value of the debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement.  Fair value for non-traded debt obligations is estimated using a standard industry income approach model which utilizes a discount rate based on market rates for debt with similar remaining time to maturity and credit risk.  The estimated fair value of total debt (including EQM s long-term debt) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately   $3.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $2.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The carrying value of total debt (including EQM s long-term debt) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately   $2.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   

I.                             Income Taxes 
    
  Prior to 2016, the Company had historically calculated the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  ordinary  income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring items) for the reporting period. The Company determined that the historical method would not provide a reliable estimate for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as small fluctuations in estimated  ordinary  income would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. As a consequence, the Company used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate taxes for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  All of EQGP s income is included in the Company s net income.  However, the Company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portion of EQGP s income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of EQGP and EQM, which reduces the Company s effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pretax income and increases the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pretax loss. 
    
  The Company s effective income tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   87.2%  , compared to   6.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily driven by the effect of income allocated to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQGP and EQM. Due to the Company's consolidated pretax loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily caused by lower realized commodity prices and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges at the EQT Production segment, EQGP's income allocated to the noncontrolling limited partners increased the effective income tax rate for the period. The increase in the effective income tax rate was also partly attributable to the tax benefit generated from a pre-tax loss on state income tax paying entities.  
    
  Excluding the impact of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance received by the Company (discussed below), the effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   15.5%  . The effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily as a result of income allocated to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQGP and EQM, a state income tax benefit as a result of lower pre-tax income on state tax paying entities and increased tax credits recorded in 2015.  Noncontrolling limited partners income increased in 2015 primarily as a result of higher net income at EQM and increased noncontrolling interests as a result of sales of EQGP and EQM limited partner interests to the public.

  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  

The Company s income tax expense was lower for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to a   $35.5 million   tax benefit recorded in connection with IRS guidance received by the Company in 2015 regarding the Company s sale of Equitable Gas Company, LLC, a regulated entity, in 2013. The transaction included a partial like-kind exchange of assets that resulted in tax deferral for the Company. However, in order to be in compliance with the normalization rules of the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS guidance held that the deferred tax liability associated with the exchanged regulatory assets should not be considered for ratemaking purposes. As a result, during the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a regulatory asset equal to the taxes deferred from the exchange and an associated income tax benefit. The regulatory asset and deferred tax benefit will reverse during the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the disposal of certain regulated assets as part of the October 2016 Sale discussed in Note O. 
    
  There were no material changes to the Company s methodology for determining unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The Company believes that it is appropriately reserved for uncertain tax positions.  

J.                             Revolving Credit Facilities 
    
  The Company has a   $1.5 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in February 2019. The Company had   no   borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   or at any time during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  EQM has a   $750 million   credit facility that expires in February 2019, and EQM had   $91 million   of borrowings and   no   letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , EQM had   $299 million   of borrowings and   no   letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings under EQM s revolving credit facility at any time during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $91 million   and   $299 million  , respectively. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings under EQM s revolving credit facility at any time during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $404 million   for both periods. The average daily balance of loans outstanding under EQM s credit facility was approximately   $34 million   and   $67 million   at a weighted average annual interest rate of   2.0%   and   1.9%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The average daily balance of loans outstanding under EQM s credit facility was approximately   $357 million   and   $241 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, at a weighted average annual interest rate of   1.7%   for both periods. 
    
  The Company incurred commitment fees averaging approximately   6   basis points for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   17   basis points for each of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , to maintain credit availability under its revolving credit facility. EQM incurred commitment fees averaging approximately   6   basis points for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   17   basis points for each of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , to maintain credit availability under its revolving credit facility.  

K.                                  Earnings Per Share 
    
  In periods when the Company reports a net loss, all options and restricted stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because of their anti-dilutive effect on loss per share. As a result, options and restricted stock totaling   1,712,527   and   1,812,142   shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Potentially dilutive securities, consisting of options and restricted stock, which were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share totaled   302,550   and   462,317   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Options to purchase common stock which were excluded from potentially dilutive securities because they were anti-dilutive totaled   291,700   and   133,500   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The impact of EQM s and EQGP s dilutive units did not have a material impact on the Company s earnings per share calculations for any of the periods presented.

M.         Pension Termination 
    
  The Company terminated the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees (Retirement Plan) effective December 31, 2014. On March 2, 2016, the IRS issued a favorable determination letter for the termination of the Retirement Plan. On June 28, 2016, the Company purchased annuities from, and transferred the Retirement Plan assets and liabilities to, American General Life Insurance Company (AGL). As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified actuarial loss remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately   $9.4 million   to earnings and approximately   $5.1 million   to a regulatory asset that will be amortized for rate recovery purposes over a period of   16   years. In connection with the purchase of annuities, the Company made a cash payment of approximately   $5.4 million   to fully fund the Retirement Plan upon liquidation during the second quarter of 2016.  

N.         Statoil Acquisition 
    
  On July 8, 2016, the Company acquired approximately   62,500   net acres from Statoil USA Onshore Properties, Inc. (Statoil) which included current natural gas production of approximately   50   MMcfe per day (the Statoil Acquisition). The net acres acquired are primarily located in Wetzel, Tyler and Harrison Counties of West Virginia. The purchase and sale agreement included an economic adjustment to put the parties in the same economic position as if the closing date for the acquisition had occurred on December 1, 2015, and the Company paid   $412.3 million   in the third quarter of 2016, inclusive of an estimate for this adjustment.  
    
  The purchase and sale agreement also included provisions for potential title defects which result in a decrease to the aggregate purchase price at an agreed upon value per defected acre or allow Statoil to replace the defected acreage subject to acceptance by the Company. The Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate adjustments to the aggregate purchase price at   September 30, 2016  ; however, the Company believes that such adjustments will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.  

O.         Subsequent Events 
    
  October 2016 Sale 
    
  On October 13, 2016, EQT entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with EQM pursuant to which EQM acquired from EQT (i)   100%   of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Allegheny Valley Connector, LLC and Rager Mountain Storage Company LLC and (ii) certain gathering assets located in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia (collectively, the October 2016 Sale).  The closing of the October 2016 Sale occurred on October 13, 2016 and was effective as of October 1, 2016. The aggregate consideration paid by EQM to EQT in connection with the October 2016 Sale was   $275 million  , which was funded with borrowings under EQM's   $750 million   revolving credit facility.   
    
  Trans Energy / Republic Energy Acquisitions 
    
  On October 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Republic Energy Ventures, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the Republic Parties) pursuant to which the Company will acquire Marcellus acres from the Republic Parties for   $319.8 million   in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments and customary closing conditions (the Republic Transaction).   
    
  Also on October 24, 2016, EQT and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Trans Energy, Inc. (the Merger Agreement). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to commence a tender offer, through its wholly owned subsidiary, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Trans Energy, Inc. (Trans Energy) for cash of   $3.58   per share. The closing of the tender offer is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of a number of Trans Energy shares that, together with shares owned by the Company and its affiliates, represents at least a majority of the total number of Trans Energy outstanding shares. The closing is also subject to the consummation of the Republic Transaction and other customary conditions. The boards of directors of both the Company and Trans Energy have unanimously approved the terms of the Merger Agreement, and the board of directors of Trans Energy has resolved to recommend that Trans Energy s stockholders accept the offer, once it is commenced. Following the completion of the tender offer, the Company will merge its wholly owned subsidiary into Trans Energy, and Trans Energy will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Trans Energy Merger).

The Republic Transaction and the Trans Energy Merger are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2016. Through the Republic Transaction and the Trans Energy Merger, the Company will acquire approximately   42,600   net Marcellus acres and   42   Marcellus wells,   33   of which are currently producing, in Wetzel, Marshall and Marion Counties, West Virginia. The Company estimates that, as of October 25, 2016, production from the Marcellus wells was approximately   42   MMcfe per day.  
    
  Pennsylvania Acquisition 
    
  On October 25, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a third party pursuant to which the Company will acquire approximately   17,000   net Marcellus acres located in Washington, Westmoreland and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and   two   related Marcellus producing wells, for   $170 million   in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments (the Pennsylvania Acquisition). The closing of the Pennsylvania Acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is also expected to occur during the fourth quarter 2016. 
    
  The Company will finance the Republic Transaction, the Trans Energy Merger and the Pennsylvania acquisition with cash on hand. 

P.        Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in United States GAAP when it becomes effective and is required to be adopted using one of two retrospective application methods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date,   which approved a one year deferral of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   which improves the understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. Early application of these ASUs is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to adopt using the modified retrospective method of adoption on January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The changes promulgated by this standard primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption of certain provisions permitted. The Company does not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The ASU requires, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. While the Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU to determine the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures, the primary effect of adopting the new standard will be to record assets and obligations for contracts currently recognized as operating leases.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This ASU is part of the initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . This ASU amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, this ASU eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This ASU addresses the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues.  The amendments in the ASU will be effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net loss attributable to EQT Corporation for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.0 million  , a loss of   $0.05   per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to EQT Corporation of   $40.8 million  ,   $0.27   per diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $48.8 million   decrease between periods was primarily attributable to a   14%   decrease in the average realized price for production sales volumes, decreased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges, higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased production sales volumes, lower income tax expense and increased gathering and transmission revenues.  
    
  The average realized price to EQT Corporation for production sales volumes was   $2.20   per Mcfe for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.55   per Mcfe for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the average realized price was driven by lower cash settled derivatives net of an increase in average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices and a decrease in average differential to NYMEX partly offset by higher natural gas liquids (NGLs) prices.   
    
  The average NYMEX natural gas index price was   $2.81   per MMBtu during the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   1%   higher than the average index price of   $2.77   per MMBtu during the   third   quarter of   2015  . Cash settled derivatives decreased by   $0.38   per Mcf as a result of lower average NYMEX hedge prices, and the average natural gas differential decreased   $0.06   per Mcf between periods. The average NGL price was   $17.13   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $11.12   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Gains on derivatives not designated as hedges were   $93.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , a decrease of   $67.9 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The   $93.4 million   gain for   2016   primarily related to favorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX and basis swaps due to a decrease in forward prices during the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP) and EQM was $  78.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  59.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $18.7 million   increase was primarily the result of increased net income at EQM and increased noncontrolling interests as a result of EQM s issuances of limited partner units to the public in 2015 and 2016.  
    
  Income tax expense was   $13.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $35.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to the reduction in EQT Production segment operating income resulting primarily from lower realized commodity prices, reduced gains on derivatives not designated as hedges and a pre-tax loss recorded on state income tax paying entities subject to higher state income tax rates. The Company s effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% for both periods primarily because the Company consolidates 100% of the pre-tax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners  share of EQGP income, but is not required to record an income tax provision with respect to the portion of the income allocated to EQGP and EQM noncontrolling public limited partners.  
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     
    
  Net loss attributable to EQT Corporation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $261.0 million  , a loss of   $1.58   per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to EQT Corporation for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $219.8 million  ,   $1.44   per diluted share. The   $480.8 million   decrease between periods was primarily attributable to a   26%   decrease in the average realized price for production sales volumes, losses on derivatives not designated as hedges in the current year compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in the prior year, higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests partially offset by increased production sales volumes, an income tax benefit in 2016 and higher gathering and transmission revenues. 
    
  The average realized price to EQT Corporation for production sales volumes was   $2.31   per Mcfe for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.11   per Mcfe for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the average realized price was driven by lower NYMEX natural gas prices including the impact of cash settled derivatives, a lower average differential to NYMEX and lower NGL prices.

The average NYMEX natural gas index price was   $2.29   per MMBtu during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   18%   lower than the average index price of   $2.80   per MMBtu during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  In addition, the average natural gas differential decreased   $0.09   per Mcf between periods. The average NGL price was   $16.42   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $18.11   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Losses on derivatives not designated as hedges were   $32.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $241.5 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $32.3 million   loss for 2016 primarily related to unfavorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps partly offset by favorable changes in the fair market value of basis swaps. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, forward NYMEX prices increased while basis prices decreased. 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of EQGP and EQM was   $238.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $165.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $73.3 million   increase was primarily the result of increased net income at EQM and increased noncontrolling interests as a result of EQM and EQGP issuances of common and limited partner units in 2015 and 2016. 
    
  Income tax benefit was   $151.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $28.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company s effective income tax rate was   87.2%   and   6.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the effect of income allocated to the noncontrolling limited parters of EQGP and EQM, a reduction in EQT Production segment operating income primarily resulting from lower realized commodity prices and a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The Company s effective tax rate differed from the U.S Federal statutory rate of 35% for both periods as the Company consolidates 100% of the pre-tax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners  share of EQGP income, but is not required to record an income tax provision with respect to the portion of the income allocated to EQGP and EQM noncontrolling public limited partners. A $35.5 million income tax benefit reduced income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to Internal Revenue Service guidance received by the Company in 2015 in connection with the Company s 2013 sale of Equitable Gas Company, LLC, a regulated entity. The deferred tax benefit will reverse during the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the disposal of certain regulated assets as part of the October 2016 Sale discussed in Note O. 
    
  On May 2, 2016, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriters), under which the Company sold to the Underwriters   10,500,000   shares of the Company's common stock, no par value (common stock), at a price to the public of   $67.00   per share (the May Offering). On May 3, 2016, the Underwriters exercised their option within the Underwriting Agreement to purchase an additional   1,575,000   shares of common stock on the same terms. The May Offering closed on May 6, 2016, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $795.6 million  , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Statoil Acquisition (as defined in Note N to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), and intends to use the remainder to fund the acquisitions discussed in Note O and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Goldman, Sachs   Co. (Goldman), under which the Company sold to Goldman   6,500,000   shares of common stock, at a price to the public of   $58.50   per share (the February Offering). On February 22, 2016, Goldman exercised its option within the Underwriting Agreement to purchase an additional   975,000   shares of common stock on the same terms. The February Offering closed on February 24, 2016, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $430.4 million  , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. 
    
  As a result of declining production volumes in the Company s non-core Huron play and the depressed commodity price environment, the Company consolidated its Huron operations in Kentucky, Virginia, and southern West Virginia during the first quarter of 2016. The consolidation is expected to improve the Company s cost structure for its Huron operations.  The Company recorded restructuring charges of $4.2 million related to the Huron operations consolidation in March 2016.

Consolidated Operational Data 
    
  The following operational information presents detailed liquid and natural gas operational information to assist in the understanding of the Company s consolidated operations. The operational information in the table below presents an average realized price ($/Mcfe), which is based on EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure.  EQT Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company s management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends.  EQT Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to EQT Corporation total operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Consolidated Operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  See  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for a reconciliation of EQT Production adjusted operating revenues to EQT Corporation total operating revenues.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Corporation total operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Consolidated Operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  EQT Production adjusted operating revenues (also referred to as total natural gas   liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company s management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain marketing services.  Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement.  EQT Production adjusted operating revenues also excludes "Net marketing services" because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production. "Net marketing services" includes both the cost of and recoveries on third-party pipeline capacity not used for EQT Production sales volumes.  Management further believes that EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information for investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings.

Business Segment Results of Operations 
    
  Business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages.  Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Company s consolidated results based on operating income.  Other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis.  Headquarters  costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters  annual operating budget.  Unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation expense and administrative costs.  
    
  The Company has reported the components of each segment s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and, where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQT s management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQT s business segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segment or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income.  In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. The Company has reconciled each segment s operating income to the Company s consolidated operating income and net income in Note F to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  EQT Production s operating loss totaled   $22.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to operating income of   $56.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $78.4 million   decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower average realized price, decreased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges and increased operating expenses, partly offset by increased sales of produced natural gas.  
    
  Total operating revenues were   $502.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $531.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a   14%   decrease in the average realized price and decreased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges, partly offset by a   26%   increase in production sales volumes in the current year.  
    
  The components of average realized price, which includes the effects of cash settled derivatives, are outlined in the table on page 27. The   $0.35   per Mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price including the impact of cash settled derivatives of   $0.35   per Mcf and a decrease in the average natural gas differential of   $0.06   per Mcf, partly offset by higher NGL prices. The decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price including the impact of cash settled derivatives between periods primarily related to lower average NYMEX hedge prices in the current year. The decrease in the average differential primarily related to the unfavorable impact of changes in natural gas prices on fixed price sales contracts and sales contracts with fixed differentials to NYMEX, partly offset by favorable Appalachian Basin basis. 
    
  The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play.  This increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company s producing wells. 
    
  Total operating revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included a   $93.4 million   gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a gain of   $160.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The gains for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily related to favorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production s NYMEX and basis swaps due to a decrease in forward prices during the third quarter of 2016. EQT Production received   $27.3 million   and   $33.2 million   of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These net cash settlements are included in the above discussion of average realized price. 
    
  Operating expenses totaled   $524.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $474.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in operating expenses was the result of increases in DD A, gathering expense, transmission expense and processing expense, partly offset by decreases in exploration expense, production taxes and LOE.  The increase in DD A expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in the current year. Gathering expenses increased by   $9.2 million   due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and by   $6.4 million   due to increased third-party volumetric charges. Transmission expenses increased by   $13.4 million   primarily due to increased affiliate volumetric costs and increased third-party costs incurred to move EQT Production s natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin. Processing expense increased by   $6.4 million   due to increased production volumes. Per unit gathering, transmission and processing expenses decreased as higher sales volumes more than offset the increased expenses. Exploration expense decreased by   $5.5 million   primarily due to decreased impairments of unproved lease acreage resulting from lease expirations during the   third   quarter 2016 compared to the   third   quarter 2015. The decrease in production taxes was primarily driven by a $2.6 million decrease in severance taxes due to the expiration of the West Virginia volume based tax in the current year and a $2.0 million decrease in property taxes primarily due to a change in assessment. The state of West Virginia previously imposed a $0.047 per Mcf additional volume based tax on severance that was terminated on July 1, 2016. The decrease in LOE was primarily due to lower personnel costs including incentive compensation. SG A expense was flat quarter over quarter but included various offsetting items, including $2.8 million of increased legal reserves and a $1.2 million increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts in 2016, offset by $3.5 million for rig release penalties incurred during the third quarter 2015. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  EQT Production s operating loss totaled   $477.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to operating income of   $175.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower average realized price, losses on derivatives not designated as hedges in the current year compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in the prior year, increased operating expenses and decreased net marketing services revenue, partly offset by increased sales of produced natural gas.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Total operating revenues were   $1,052.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,563.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Production sales decreased as a result of a lower average realized price, partly offset by a   25%   increase in production sales volumes in the current year. EQT Production received   $222.5 million   and   $69.7 million   of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, that are included in the average realized price but not included in production sales. Changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play.  This increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company s producing wells. 
    
  The   $0.80   per Mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price including the impact of cash settled derivatives of   $0.73   per Mcf, a decrease in the average natural gas differential of   $0.09   per Mcf and lower NGL prices. The decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis, partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps. While Appalachian Basin basis improved for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , market prices in the United States Northeast region were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions. Additionally, the impact of changes in natural gas prices on sales contracts with fixed differentials to NYMEX and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis period over period. 
    
  Net marketing services includes both the cost of and recoveries on third-party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The   $15.9 million   decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the Company's Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity, increased storage costs in the current year and the costs, net of recoveries, for the Company's Rockies Express Pipeline capacity contract that started in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Total operating revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included a   $32.3 million   loss on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a gain of   $209.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily related to unfavorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production s NYMEX swaps, partially offset by favorable changes in the fair market value of basis swaps. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , forward NYMEX prices increased while basis prices decreased.  
    
  Operating expenses totaled   $1,529.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,388.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in operating expenses was the result of increases in DD A, gathering expense, transmission expense and processing expense, partly offset by decreases in exploration expense, production taxes, impairment of long-lived assets and LOE. The increase in DD A expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in the current year. Gathering expenses increased by   $37.0 million   due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric costs and increased by   $18.2 million   due to increased third-party volumetric costs. Transmission expenses increased primarily due to   $21.8 million   of increased affiliate volumetric costs and increased third-party costs of $14.7 million incurred to move EQT Production s natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin. Processing expense increased by   $11.9 million   as a result of the Company's production volume growth. Per unit gathering, transmission and processing expenses decreased as sales volumes increased more than these expenses. Exploration expense decreased by   $22.7 million   primarily due to decreased impairments of unproved lease acreage resulting from lease expirations during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in production taxes was primarily driven by lower property taxes of $2.9 million due to a change in the assessment during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and a $2.8 million decrease as a result of lower commodity prices and expiration of the West Virginia volume based tax in the current year. The state of West Virginia previously imposed a $0.047 per Mcf additional volume based tax on severance that was terminated on July 1, 2016. Impairment of long-lived assets decreased due to a proved property impairment of the Utica Shale in Ohio of   $4.3 million   incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in LOE of   $3.5 million   was primarily due to decreased salt water disposal costs as a result of increased recycling in the Marcellus Shale.  SG A expense was flat year over year but included various offsetting items, including $8.7 million of increased legal reserves, a $3.0 million increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, $2.0 million of costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations and a charge of $1.7 million related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees (the Retirement Plan) incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , offset by $10.4 million for drilling program reduction charges, including rig release penalties, incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and decreased personnel and professional services costs incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  EQT Midstream s operating income totaled   $132.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $113.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering and transmission operating revenues and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower storage, marketing and other operating revenues. 
    
  Gathering revenues increased by   $10.2 million   primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third-party volumes gathered for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , driven by increased affiliate and third-party production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by reduced affiliate volumes in the Huron shale. EQT Midstream increased firm reservation fee revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of increased capacity under firm contracts with affiliates and third-party producers. Higher volumes transported on these contracts also resulted in an increase in usage fees under firm contracts. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to affiliates contracting for additional firm capacity and the reduced volumes in the Huron shale. 
    
  Transmission revenues increased by   $6.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was driven by higher usage fees under firm contracts as a result of an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third-party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This reduction did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Firm reservation fees increased as a result of higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased as a result of higher affiliate and third-party volumes transported on an interruptible basis. 
    
  Total operating expenses decreased by   $4.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . O M expense decreased   $4.8 million   primarily as a result of a $2.8 million decrease in purchased gas costs related to lower gas prices and $1.1 million of lower personnel costs. SG A expense decreased   $2.2 million   primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in incentive compensation. Increased allocated expenses from affiliates were partly offset by an environmental reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in DD A of   $3.1 million   as a result of additional assets placed in-service.  
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  EQT Midstream s operating income totaled   $399.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $350.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in operating income was the result of increased gathering and transmission operating revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. 
    
  Gathering revenues increased by   $31.3 million   primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third-party volumes gathered for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale partly offset by reduced volumes in the Huron shale. EQT Midstream increased firm reservation fee revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of increased capacity under firm contracts with affiliates and third-party producers. Higher volumes transported on these contracts also resulted in an increase in usage fees under firm contracts. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to affiliates contracting for additional firm capacity and the reduced volumes in the Huron shale. 
    
  Transmission revenues increased by   $22.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was driven by higher usage fees under firm contracts as a result of an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third-party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Firm reservation fees increased as a result of higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased as a result of higher affiliate and third-party volumes transported on an interruptible basis.

Total operating expenses increased by   $6.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . O M expense decreased   $8.2 million   primarily as a result of a $5.9 million decrease in purchased gas costs related to reduced marketing activity, $1.5 million of lower property taxes due to a change in the assessment during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , lower pipeline operating costs and lower incentive compensation costs partly offset by $1.9 million of expense related to the consolidation of the Company s Huron operations. SG A expense increased   $4.7 million   primarily as a result of $7.7 million of expense recorded in connection with the termination of the Retirement Plan and increased allocated expenses from affiliates, partly offset by $1.9 million related to the impairment of certain expiring right of way options in 2015, $1.6 million of lower personnel costs primarily related to incentive compensation and an environmental reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2015. DD A increased   $9.5 million   as a result of additional assets being placed in-service.

    Other Income 
    
  Other income increased by   $8.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily driven by increased Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) - equity of $6.1 million, mainly attributable to increased spending on the Ohio Valley Connector (OVC) project, and $2.0 million in higher equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP project.  
    
  Other income increased by   $16.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily driven by increased AFUDC - equity of $12.9 million, mainly attributable to increased spending on the OVC project, and $4.8 million in higher equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP project.

OUTLOOK 
    
  The Company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas and NGL reserves through environmentally responsible, cost-effective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling. The Company s revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company s ability to develop its reserves of, natural gas and NGLs as well as gathering and transmission revenues from third parties, which represented 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Despite the continued depressed price environment for natural gas and NGLs, the Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company s large resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. The Company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area. 
    
  Total capital investment by EQT in 2016, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion (including EQM). Capital spending for well development (primarily drilling and completions) of approximately $1.0 billion in 2016 is expected to support the drilling of approximately 140 wells, including 135 Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells and 5 deep Utica wells. Estimated sales volumes are expected to be 750 - 755 Bcfe, for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 25% in 2016 as compared to 2015, while total liquids sales volumes are expected to be 11,825 - 11,915 Mbbls. To support continued growth in production, the Company plans to invest approximately $0.8 billion on midstream infrastructure in 2016, primarily through EQM.  
    
  The market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin and NGLs were depressed throughout 2015 and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the Company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, including Appalachian basis, and NGLs and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations. Low prices may signal a need to reduce capital spending, record non-cash impairments in the book value of the Company s gas properties and midstream assets, and/or make downward adjustments to the Company s estimated proved reserves. Any such impairment and/or downward adjustment to the Company s estimated reserves could potentially be material to the Company.  
    
  See "Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties" and  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of the Company s accounting policies and significant assumptions related to accounting for oil and gas producing activities, and the Company's policies and processes with respect to impairment reviews for proved and unproved property. As a result of its third quarter 2016 evaluations, the Company did not recognize an impairment charge for proved properties.  However, a further decline in the average five-year forward realized prices in a future period may cause the Company to recognize a significant impairment on the assets in the Huron play, which had a carrying value of approximately $3 billion at September 30, 2016. The Company anticipates an impairment on certain gathering assets as a result of the sale of these assets to EQM in October 2016. 
    
  The Company continues to focus on creating and maximizing shareholder value through the implementation of a strategy that economically monetizes its asset base and prudently pursues investment opportunities, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with solid cash flow. The Company monitors current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly. While the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions, the Company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for re-deployment into its highest value development opportunities. The Company continues to consider transactions that would add to its Marcellus and Utica positions with a focus on transactions that would add contiguous acreage or fill-in existing gaps.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  Overview 
    
  The Company s primary sources of cash for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were proceeds from the public offerings of EQT common stock and cash flows from operating activities, while the primary use of cash was for capital expenditures. 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled   $767.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $900.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $132.5 million   decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower operating income, the reasons for which are discussed in the section captioned "Corporate Overview" in Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," partially offset by higher cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes. 
    
  The Company's cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities. The Company is unable to predict these future price movements.  
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled   $1,669.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,975.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $305.8 million   decrease was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of   $706.0 million   due to a reduction in the drilling and completions activity over the last twelve months, partly offset by   $412.3 million   of capital expenditures resulting from the Statoil acquisition in 2016 and an increase in capital expenditures related to the OVC project. The Company spud   68   gross wells in the first nine months of   2016  , including   65   horizontal Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells and   3   horizontal Utica wells. The Company spud 134 gross wells in the first nine months of   2015  , including 130 horizontal Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells, 2 horizontal Utica wells and 2 horizontal Permian Basin wells.  
    
  Capital expenditures as reported on the Statement of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   excluded capitalized non-cash stock-based compensation expense and accruals. The impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the reversal of the prior period accrual as well as the current period estimate, both of which are non-cash items.  The impact of these non-cash items was $1.2 million and $(75.6) million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled   $1,057.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,660.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $602.3 million   between periods. During the first nine months of 2016, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from its public offerings of common stock and from EQM's public offerings of common units under the $750 million ATM Program. The primary financing uses of cash during this period were net credit facility repayments under the EQM credit facility, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and payment of taxes related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , financing cash flows were from EQM's public offering of common units, including sales under the $750 million ATM Program, net proceeds from EQGP's IPOs and net proceeds from borrowings on EQM's credit facility; the primary financing uses of cash were distributions to noncontrolling interests and income tax withholdings related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards.  
    
  The Company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements and contractual and legal restrictions and other factors.

The Company s and EQM s credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Company s or EQM s access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits on the Company s derivative contracts would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances, including collateral, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease.  The required margin on the Company s derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating, such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated BBB- or higher by Standard   Poor's Rating Service, Baa3 or higher by Moody's Investors Service, and BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings Service.  Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade. 
    
  The Company has a $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility that expires in February 2019; the Company had no amounts outstanding under the facility as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company s debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions.  The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions.  The Company s credit facility contains financial covenants that require a total debt-to-total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%.  The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants. 
    
  EQM has a $750 million credit facility that expires in February 2019, and EQM had   $91 million   in outstanding borrowings under the facility as of   September 30, 2016  . EQM s debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions.  The covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions.  Under EQM s credit facility, EQM is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions).  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into a   $500 million  ,   364  -day, uncommitted revolving loan agreement with EQT (the   364  -Day Facility). The   364  -Day Facility will mature on October 25, 2017 and will automatically renew for successive   364  -day periods unless EQT delivers a non-renewal notice at least   60   days prior to the then current maturity date.  EQM may terminate the   364  -Day Facility at any time by repaying in full the unpaid principal amount of all loans together with interest thereon.  The   364  -Day Facility is available for general partnership purposes and does not contain any covenants other than the obligation to pay accrued interest on outstanding borrowings.  Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at an interest rate equal to the rate then applicable to similar loans under EQM's $750 Million revolving credit facility, or a successor revolving credit facility, less the sum of (i) the then applicable commitment fee under EQM's $750 Million revolving credit facility and (ii) 10 basis points. 
    
  EQM ATM Program 
    
  During 2015, EQM entered into an equity distribution agreement that established an  At the Market  (ATM) common unit offering program, pursuant to which a group of managers acting as EQM s sales agents may sell EQM common units having an aggregate offering price of up to $750 million. EQM had approximately   $443 million   in remaining capacity under the program as of   October 27, 2016  .   
    
  Commodity Risk Management 
    
  The substantial majority of the Company s commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the Company s produced natural gas.  The Company s overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily NYMEX swaps and collars.  
    
  As of October 25, 2016, the approximate volumes and prices of the Company s derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2016 through 2018 were: 

(a)      October through December 31. 
  (b)     The Company also sold calendar year 2016, 2017 and 2018 calls for approximately 11 Bcf, 32 Bcf and 16 Bcf at strike prices of $3.65 per Mcf, $3.53 per Mcf and $3.48 per Mcf, respectively.  
   (d)     The average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf. 
         
  The Company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery. The difference between these sales prices and NYMEX are included in average differential on the Company's Price Reconciliation. The Company has fixed price physical sales for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 of 9 Bcf and 24 Bcf at average prices of $3.09 per Mcf and $2.97 per Mcf, respectively. For 2016 through 2018, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.88 per Mcf. For 2018, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 7 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX floor price of $2.16 per Mcf and a ceiling price of $4.47 per Mcf. The Company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its NGL exposure. The Company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy. 
    
  See Item 3,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  and Note G to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s hedging program.

Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company.  While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings.  The Company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred.  The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of September 30, 2016  , EQM had issued a   $91 million   performance guarantee (the Initial Guarantee) in connection with the obligations of MVP Holdco, LLC (MVP Holdco) to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP. Upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission s initial release to begin construction of the MVP, the Initial Guarantee will terminate, and EQM will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to 33% of MVP Holdco s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by an affiliate of EQM under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the MVP Joint Venture. 
    
  Dividend 
    
  On October 12, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of three cents per share, payable December 1, 2016, to the Company s shareholders of record at the close of business on November 11, 2016. 
    
  On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of EQGP s general partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP s unitholders for the   third   quarter of 2016 of   $0.165   per common unit, or approximately   $43.9 million  .  The distribution will be paid on November 22, 2016 to unitholders of record, including the Company, at the close of business on November 4, 2016. 
    
  On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of EQM s general partner declared a cash distribution to EQM s unitholders for the   third   quarter of 2016 of   $0.815   per common unit. The cash distribution will be paid on November 14, 2016 to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on November 4, 2016. Based on the   80,581,758   EQM common units outstanding on October 27, 2016, the aggregate cash distributions by EQM to EQGP will be approximately   $44.3 million   consisting of:   $17.8 million   in respect of its limited partner interest,   $1.6 million   in respect of its general partner interest and   $24.9 million   in respect of its incentive distribution rights. The distributions to EQGP in respect of its general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in EQM are subject to change if EQM issues additional common units on or prior to the record date for the   third   quarter 2016 distribution. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company s critical accounting policies are described in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been included in the notes to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  .  The application of the Company s critical accounting policies may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments.  Different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Commodity Price Risk and Derivative Instruments  
    
  The Company s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and NGLs. The market price for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continues to be lower relative to NYMEX Henry Hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the Northeast region in recent years. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the Company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, including Appalachian basis, and NGLs and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations. Prolonged low, and/or significant or extended declines in, natural gas and NGL prices could adversely affect, among other things, the Company s development plans, which could decrease the pace of development and the level of the Company s proved reserves. Such changes or similar impacts on third-party shippers on the Company's midstream assets could also impact the Company s revenues, earnings or liquidity and could result in a material non-cash impairment in the recorded value of the Company s property, plant and equipment.  
    
  In addition to the ability to elect to slow capital spending in periods of prolonged low, and/or significant declines in, natural gas and NGL prices, the Company uses derivatives to reduce the effects of commodity price volatility. The Company s use of derivatives is further described in Note G to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and under the caption  Commodity Risk Management  in the  Capital Resources and Liquidity  section of Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored. The Company primarily enters into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production. The Company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the Company s Hedge and Financial Risk Committee and reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.  
    
  For the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the Company s forecasted sales of production, most of which are hedged at NYMEX natural gas prices, the Company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk. The Company has an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes.  
    
  The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily fixed price swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity. The Company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy.  
    
  The Company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted. The Company s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect a portion of cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices.  
    
  With respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company, the Company hedged portions of expected sales of equity production and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately   624   Bcf of natural gas and   913   Mbbls of NGLs as of   September 30, 2016  , and   664   Bcf of natural gas as of   December 31, 2015  . See the  Commodity Risk Management  section in the  Capital Resources and Liquidity  section of Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
    
  A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   levels would have increased the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately   $146.3 million   and $  137.1 million  , respectively. A hypothetical increase of 10% in the market price of natural gas from the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   levels would have decreased the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately   $148.4 million   and $  138.4 million  , respectively. The Company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in Note H to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company assumed a 10% change in the price of natural gas from its levels at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The price change was then applied to the natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, resulting in the hypothetical change in fair value.  
    
  The above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the Company s physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the Company s forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of the Company s expected physical sales of natural gas. Therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the Company s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

be offset by a favorable impact on the Company s physical sales of natural gas, assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term, the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk, the anticipated transactions occur as expected and basis does not significantly change.  
    
  If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first.  
    
  Interest Rate Risk  
    
  Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the Company, EQGP and EQM earn on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest rates the Company and EQM pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities. All of the Company s and EQM s long-term borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the Company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the Company s and EQM s fixed rate debt. See Note J to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s and EQM s revolving credit facilities and Note H to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of fair value measurements, including the fair value of long-term debt.  
    
  Other Market Risks  
    
  The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value, which may change as market prices change. The Company s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and, thus, are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole. The Company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures. These include closely monitoring current market conditions, counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better, enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security.  
    
  Approximately   66%  , or   $134.7 million  , of the Company s OTC derivative contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   had a positive fair value. Approximately 95%, or $417.4 million, of the Company s OTC derivative contracts outstanding at   December 31, 2015   had a positive fair value.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts. The Company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non-performance risk adjustment included in the Company s established fair value procedure. The Company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  The Company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales or transportation of natural gas. A significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable of EQT Production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas and NGLs to certain marketers, utility and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian Basin and the Northeastern United States as well as the Permian Basin of Texas and a gas processor in Kentucky and West Virginia. Additionally, a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable of EQT Midstream are generated from the transmission and gathering of natural gas in Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  
    
  The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in February 2019. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility. No one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. The Company s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the Company s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry.  
    
  EQM has a $750 million revolving credit facility that expires in February 2019. The credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by EQM. As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM had   $91.0 million   in borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. No one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. EQM s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit EQM s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), was conducted as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors
