F  orward-Looking Statements  
 This report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as  aim,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   outlook,   potential,   project,   projection,   plan,   intend,   seek,   may,   could,   would,   will,   should,   can,   can have,   likely,  the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. They appear in a number of places throughout this report and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including:  

our ability to successfully implement our growth;      

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow or raise capital on acceptable terms;      

the loss of key members of our senior management team;     

allegations that our products cause injury or illness or fail to comply with government regulations;      

the loss of a significant customer;      

the effectiveness of our marketing and trade spending programs;      

our ability to introduce new products and improve existing products;      

our limited manufacturing capacity;      

the impact of government regulation, scrutiny, warning and public perception;      

the effect of false marketing claims;      

adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, pestilences and other natural conditions affecting our operations;      

our ability to develop and maintain our brand;     

the exposure to ingredient costs;     

volatility in the price of our common stock; and      

other factors discussed under the headings  Risk Factors  and  Business  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Form 10-K ) and   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this report.     

While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)  

Note 1   Nature of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  
 Nature of the Business    Freshpet, Inc. (hereafter referred to as  Freshpet  or the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, manufactures and markets natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats. The Company s products are distributed throughout the United States, Canada, and other international test markets into major retail classes including Grocery and Mass (which includes club) as well as Pet Specialty and Natural retail.   
 Principles of Consolidation      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). The financial statements include the accounts of the Company as well as the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
 Basis of Presentation      The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the interim unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The results for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other interim periods, or any future year or period.  
 These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Estimates and Uncertainties    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results, as determined at a later date, could differ from those estimates.  
 Reclassifications    Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation.  
 Note 2   Recently Issued Accounting Standards: 
 In May 2014, the Financing Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU  No. 2014-09  to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is only permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 regarding identification of performance obligations and licensing considerations and ASU No. 2016-12 regarding narrow scope improvements and practical expedients. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
   
   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  which requires that debt issuance cost be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt

  discounts or premiums. This new guidance was adopted beginning January 1, 2016 a  nd did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements other than presentation.  
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which requires that an entity carry its inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value (which replaces  lower of cost or market ) if the first-in first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost methods are used. This new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. The impact of ASU No. 2015-11 will depend on future valuation of the Company s inventory. 
   
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The new guidance was adopted beginning January 1, 2016. The effects of ASU 2015-17 will change retrospectively how deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified within the balance sheet and notes thereto. Due to the Company s full valuation allowance, deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases,  which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its corporate office lease, and upon adoption of this guidance, expects to record the lease on its consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations,  which clarifies the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements under ASU No. 2014-09. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt this amendment in the second quarter of 2016. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. The impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income/(Loss) was not material. The amendments related to excess tax benefits are not material due to the Company s net operating losses. 
   
 In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, such as proceeds from insurance claims. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company accounts for all applicable cash flows in accordance with this guidance and does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and financial statement disclosures.

The Company invested $17.4 million in the Freshpet Kitchens expansion during 2016.   A portion of the new equipment was placed in service in July 2016.

Note 5   Accrued Expenses: 

(1) Accrued Leadership Transition Costs represent costs detailed within our former Chief Executive Officer s separation agreement as well as incremental costs associated with leadership transition. 
 Note 6   Debt:  
   
 On November 13, 2014, the Company entered into senior secured credit facilities (the  Debt Refinancing ) comprised of a 5-year $18.0 million term facility (the  Term Facility ), a 3-year $10.0 million revolving facility (the  Revolving Facility ) and a $12.0 million additional term loan commitment earmarked primarily for capital expenditures (the  Capex Commitments  and together with the Term Facility and Revolving Facility, the  Credit Facilities  and such loan agreement, the  Loan Agreement ).  
 On December 23, 2014, the Company repaid the outstanding $18.0 million and modified the terms of the $40.0 million Credit Facilities. The $18.0 million term facility was extinguished, the 3-year $10.0 million Revolving Facility remained unchanged, and the $12.0 million term loan commitment earmarked for capital expenditures was increased to $30.0 million. 
   
 Any drawn Capex Commitments will mature on the fifth anniversary of the execution of the Loan Agreement. Any undrawn Capex Commitments will expire on the third anniversary of the execution of the Loan Agreement. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the commitments for the Revolving Facility may be increased up to $20.0 million subject to certain conditions. 
   
 The Loan Agreement provides for the maintenance of various covenants, including financial covenants, and includes events of default that are customary for facilities of this type.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants in the Loan Agreement and had $9.0 million in debt outstanding under the Credit Facilities.  
   
 There was no accrued interest on the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Interest expense and fees totaled $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Interest expense and fees totaled $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

  the Company. These options   vest over 5 years. Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the 2006 Plan). At September 30, 2016, there were zero shares available for grant as the 2006 Plan is frozen.  
 2010 Stock Plan  In December 2010, the Company approved the 2010 Stock Plan (the  2010 Plan ) under which options to purchase approximately 2,146,320 shares of the Company s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company (in 2012, the 2010 Plan was amended to allow for the granting of approximately 2,220,280 options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock)  . These   options are either time-based (vest over 4 years), performance-based (vest when performance targets are met, as defined in the stock option grant agreement),   or vest at the occurrence of an exit event which is defined as either as change of control in the Company or an initial public offering (as defined in the stock option grant agreement)  . At September 30, 2016, there were zero shares available for grant as the 2010 plan is frozen.    
 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan  In November 2014, the Company approved the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) under which 1,479,200 shares of common stock may be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted under the 2014 Plan.

These awards may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, as well as other stock-based and cash-based awards. As of September 30, 2016, the awards granted were either time-based (cliff vest over 3 years), performance-based (vest when performance targets are met, as defined in the stock option grant agreement), or restricted stock units (employee RSUs cliff vest over 3 years and non-employee director RSUs cliff vest over 1 year).   
 At September 30, 2016, there were 2,611,636 shares of common stock available to be issued or used for reference purposes under the 2014 Plan.

Under the terms of the agreement, the grant is governed as if issued under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the awards granted were time-based (cliff vest over 4 years) and performance-based (vest when performance targets are met, as defined in the stock option grant agreement).

    There were no   restricted stock units granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
 Note 8   Earnings Per Share:  
 Basic net income/(loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income/(loss) per share of common stock is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no adjustments between net income/(loss) and net loss attributable to common stockholders. 
 The potentially dilutive securities are as follows: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, diluted net loss per share of common stock is the same as basic net loss per share of common stock, due to the fact that potentially dilutive securities would have an antidilutive effect as the Company incurred a net loss during such periods. 
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, diluted net income/(loss) per share of common stock is calculated as follows: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were 450,189 anti-dilutive service period stock options excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
   
 Note 9   Related Party Transactions:  
 Payments of $1,484,600 and $4,666,495 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $1,563,245 and $4,448,727 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were made to one stockholder for the purchase of raw materials. The Company believes that all payments made to the shareholder are at market value and thus at arms-length.

 Overview  
 We started Freshpet with a single-minded mission to bring the power of real, fresh food to our dogs and cats. We were inspired by the rapidly growing view among pet owners that their dogs and cats are a part of their family, leading them to demand healthier pet food choices. Over the last ten years, we have created a comprehensive business model to deliver wholesome pet food that  pet parents  can trust, and in the process we believe we have become one of the fastest growing pet food companies in North America. Our business model is difficult for others to replicate and we see significant opportunity for future growth by leveraging the unique elements of our business, including our brand, our product know-how, our Freshpet Kitchens, our refrigerated distribution, our Freshpet Fridge and our culture. 
   
 Recent Developments 
 Due to the continued growth of the Company s fresh pet food sales, the Company has undertaken a capital expansion project at its Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing facility to expand plant capacity and increase distribution. The Company invested $17.4 million in the Freshpet Kitchens expansion during 2016.   A portion of the new equipment was placed in service in July 2016, which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. The remainder of the new equipment will be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In order to fund the expansion, we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities in the second and third quarter and repaid $1.0 million during the third quarter. We expect to repay the remainder of this indebtedness by the end of the first half of 2017.   
 Additionally, we recently expanded our business on a test basis to two retailers in the United Kingdom, where our products are selling in 63 stores. 
 Components of our Operating Results 
 Net Sales  
 Our net sales are derived from the sale of pet food to our customers, who purchase either directly from us or through third party distributors. Our products are sold to consumers through a fast-growing network of company-owned branded refrigerators, known as Freshpet Fridges, located in our customers  stores. We continue to roll out Freshpet Fridges across leading retailers across North America and have installed Freshpet Fridges in over 16,200 retail stores as of September 30, 2016. All of our products are sold under the Freshpet brand name, with ingredients, packaging and labeling customized by class of retail. Sales are recorded net of discounts, slotting, returns and promotional allowances.  
 Our net sales growth is driven by the following key factors:  

Increasing sales velocity from the average Freshpet Fridge due to increasing awareness, trial and adoption of Freshpet products. Our investments in marketing and advertising help to drive awareness and trial at each point of sale.      

Continued innovation and new product introductions. New products introduced since 2011 represented 46% of our net sales in 2015. From time to time, we review our product line and may remove products that are not meeting sales or profitability goals.      

 15 

Increased penetration of Freshpet Fr  idge locations in major classes of retail, including grocery, mass, club, pet specialty and natural. The impact of new Freshpet Fridge installations on our net sales varies by retail class and depends on numerous factors including store traffic, refrigerat  or size, placement within the store, and proximity to other stores that carry our products.      

Consumer trends including growing pet ownership, pet humanization and a focus on health and wellness.      

 We believe that as a result of the above key factors, we will continue to penetrate the pet food marketplace and increase our share of the pet food category.  
 Gross Profit  
 Our gross profit is net of costs of goods sold, which include the costs of product manufacturing, product ingredients, packaging materials, spoils, and inbound freight. As discussed above, we have also undertaken a capital expansion project at our Freshpet Kitchens facility that we believe will further increase our production capacity by at least 130%. Over time, growing capacity utilization of our new facility will allow us to leverage fixed costs and thereby expand our gross profit margins. 
   
 Our gross profit margins are also impacted by the cost of ingredients and packaging materials. We expect to mitigate any adverse movement in input costs through a combination of cost management and price increases.  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of the following:  
 Outbound freight.  Prior to the second quarter of 2016, outbound freight from our Freshpet Kitchens was managed by a national third party refrigerated and frozen human food manufacturer. During the second quarter, we transitioned to a new third party logistics provider. Through our new third party logistics provider s infrastructure, we realized cost efficiencies in logistics during the third quarter. Additionally, we sell through third party distributors for the grocery, mass, club, pet specialty and natural classes in the United States, Canada, and on a test basis in the United Kingdom.  
 Marketing   advertising.  Our marketing and advertising expenses primarily consist of national television media, digital marketing, social media, and grass roots marketing to drive brand awareness. These expenses may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our marketing and advertising campaigns. We expect our marketing   advertising costs to decrease as a percentage of net sales as we leverage national advertising spend across a growing network of Freshpet Fridges.  
 Freshpet Fridge operating costs.  Freshpet Fridge operating costs consist of repair costs and depreciation. The purchase and installation costs for new Freshpet Fridges are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful life. All new refrigerators are covered by a manufacturer warranty for one to three years. We subsequently incur maintenance and freight costs for repairs and refurbishments handled by third-party service providers.  
 Research   development.  Research and development costs consist of expenses to develop and test new products.  The costs are expensed as incurred.  
 Brokerage.  We utilize third-party brokers to assist with monitoring our products at the point-of-sale as well as representing us at headquarters for various customers. These brokers visit our retail customers  store locations to ensure items are appropriately stocked and maintained.  
 Other general   administrative costs.  Other general and administrative costs include non-plant personnel salaries and benefits, as well as corporate general   administrative costs.   
 Selling, general and administrative costs.  Selling, general   administrative ( SG A ) costs as a percentage of net sales have decreased from 62.7% in the year ended 2013 to 55.7% in the year ended 2014 and to 50.2% in the year ended 2015. SG A costs as a percentage of net sales decreased from 55.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 49.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We expect our SG A expenses to continue to decrease as a percentage of net sales as we continue to expand our distribution footprint and grow our net sales.   
 16 

Income Taxes   
 We had federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carry forwards of approximately $158.0 million as of December 31, 2015, which will expire between 2025 and 2035. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of NOL carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in NOL carry forwards expiring unused. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $128.6 million of state NOL carry forwards, which will expire between 2016 and 2035. At December 31, 2015, we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as the realization of such assets was not considered more likely than not.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 Freshpet uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in its financial communications. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. 
   Adjusted Gr oss Profit 
   Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales (Adjusted Gross Margin)  
   Adjusted SG A expenses  
   Adjusted SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales  
   EBITDA  
   Adjusted EBITDA  
   
 The non-GAAP financial measures are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit before non-cash depreciation expense and plant start-up costs. We define Adjusted SG A Expenses as SG A Expenses before non-cash share-based compensation, leadership transition expenses, and fees related to a secondary offering. EBITDA represents net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on disposal of equipment, plant start-up expense, share-based compensation, warrant fair valuation, launch expenses, fees related to a secondary offering, and leadership transition costs. 
 We believe that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to the closest comparable U.S.. GAAP measures, provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We use the non-GAAP financial measures, together with U.S GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, gross profit margins, and cash flow from operations, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is an important component of internal budgeting and setting management compensation. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures are presented here because we believe they are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items, and other items as detailed below. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, income from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as we do. 
 Our presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from that term or by unusual or non-recurring items. We recognize that the non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect: 

our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures;     

the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness;     

depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, nor any cash requirements for such replacements; and     

changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs.     

   Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) non-cash stock based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package, and (ii) certain costs essential to our sales growth and strategy, including an allowance for marketing expenses for each new store added to our network and non-capitalizable freight costs associated with Freshpet Fridge replacements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash charges  
 21 

resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than   we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss), the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP: 

(a) Represents new store marketing allowance of $1,000 for each store added to our distribution network as well as the non-capitalized freight costs associated wit h Freshpet Fridge replacements. The expense enhances the overall marketing spend to support our growing distribution network. 
 (b) Represents additional operating costs incurred in 2016 in connection with the start-up of our new manufacturing lines as part  of the Freshpet Kitchens expansion project. 
 (c) Represents non-cash stock based compensation expense.  
 (d) Represents the change of fair value for the outstanding common stock warrants.  
 (e) Represents fees associated with the secondary public offering of ou r common stock, which was completed on May 5, 2015. 
 (f)  Represents charges associated within our former Chief Executive Officer s separation agreement as well as changes in estimates associated with leadership transition costs.

The following table   provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit to Gross Profit, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP:  

(a) Represents non-cash depreciation expense included in Cost of Goods Sold.  
 (b) Represents additional operating costs incurred in 2016 in connection with the start-up of our new manufacturing lines as part of the  Freshpet Kitchens expansion project. 
   
 The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted SG A Expenses to SG A Expenses, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP: 

(a) Represents non-cash stock based compensation expense.  
 (b) Represents fees associated with the secondary public offering of our common stock, which was completed on May 5, 2015.  
 (c)  Represents charges associated within our former Chief Executive Officer s separation agreement as well as changes in estimates associated with leadership transition costs. 
   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Developing our business will require significant capital in the future. To meet our capital needs, we expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations, and our current available borrowing capacity. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors, including general market conditions, our operating performance, the market s perception of our growth potential, lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions, such as financial covenants under our debt agreements. 
 23 

Additionally, our ability t  o make payments on, and to refinance, any indebtedness under our Credit Facilities and to fund any necessary expenditures for our growth will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability   or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. Future third-party financing may not be available on favorable terms or   at all.  
 We believe that cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flow from operations and planned borrowing capacity are adequate to fund debt service requirements, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Working Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. The working capital decrease to $(0.3) million at September 30, 2016 compared with $16.2 million at December 31, 2015 is primarily related to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of $26.1 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by cash flows from operations of $7.3 million, the increase in working capital assets and liabilities of $0.3 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.0 million. 
 Our primary cash needs are for ingredients, purchases and operating expenses, marketing expenses and capital expenditures to procure Freshpet Fridges and expand and improve our manufacturing plant to support our net sales growth. The Company invested $17.4 million in the Freshpet Kitchens expansion project during 2016. A portion of the new equipment was placed in service in July, which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of $0.5 million in the third quarter.  With the wind down of the expansion project, we expect to run the business and payback short-term borrowings with cash flow from operations.  
 We normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory. The average duration of our accounts receivable is approximately three weeks. 
 As of September 30, 2016, our capital resources consisted primarily of $3.5 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our Credit Facilities. As noted above, we undertook a capital expansion project at our Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing facility. In order to fund the expansion, we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities in the second and third quarter, and repaid $1.0 million during the third quarter of 2016. We expect to repay the remainder of this indebtedness by the end of the first half of 2017. 
 24 

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash, net cash flows provided by (or used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash.  

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.  
 Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (provision for loss on receivables, loss on disposal of equipment, depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, and the fair valuation of warrants). 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.3 million, primarily consisting of adjusted net income of $6.4 million, which excludes $10.8 million of non-cash items primarily relating to $3.5 million of share based compensation and $7.0 million of depreciation and amortization. Proceeds were offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.9 million. Change in assets of $2.1 million is primarily related to growth in accounts receivable, which is primarily due to growth in net sales and an increase in the number of stores with a Freshpet fridge. The increase in liabilities of $3.0 million was due to timing of payments and accrued leadership transition costs. 
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million, which primarily consisted of adjusted net income of $4.4 million, which excludes $10.9 million of non-cash items primarily relating to $5.1 million of share based compensation, which includes the fair value adjustment of warrants, and $5.5 million of depreciation and amortization. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 there was $0.6 million of proceeds due to the change in operating assets and liabilities as a result of the increase of net liabilities being greater than the increase in net assets. The decrease in accounts payable was due to timing. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in net sales. The decrease in inventory was due to timing of raw material purchases. The change in the other assets and liabilities was due to timing. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  
 Net cash used in investing activities was $22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, relating primarily to September 30, 2016 capital expenditures for Freshpet Kitchens of $19.8 million (including the Freshpet Kitchens expansion of $17.4 million and recurring capital expenditures of $2.4 million) and investment in fridges and other capital spend of $6.3 million. The cash used in investing activities was partially offset by maturities of short-term investments of $3.3 million. 
   
 Net cash used in investing activities was $26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which relates primarily to purchases of short-term investments, net of settlement, of $3.7 million, capital expenditures related to the Freshpet Kitchens of $11.2 million (including the Freshpet Kitchens expansion of $10.2 million and recurring capital expenditures of $1.0 million), purchase of a building with 6.5 acres of land adjacent to our Freshpet Kitchens for $5.0 million and investment in fridges as well as other miscellaneous capital spend of $6.4 million. 
 Net Cash from Financing Activities  
 Net cash from financing activities was $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, attributable to the exercise of stock options of $2.0 million and the proceeds from borrowing $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities, partially offset by repayments of short term borrowing of $1.0 million. 
 Net cash from financing activities was $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, attributable to the exercise of stock options. 
 25 

Indebtedness   
   
 On November 13, 2014, the Company entered into senior secured credit facilities (the  Debt Refinancing ) comprised of a 5-year $18.0 million term facility (the  Term Facility ), a 3-year $10.0 million revolving facility (the  Revolving Facility ) and a $12.0 million additional term loan commitment earmarked primarily for capital expenditures (the  Capex Commitments  and together with the Term Facility and Revolving Facility, the  Credit Facilities  and such loan agreement, the  Loan Agreement ).  On December 23, 2014, the Company repaid the outstanding $18.0 million and modified the terms of the $40.0 million Credit Facilities. The $18.0 million term facility was extinguished, the 3-year $10.0 million Revolving Facility remained unchanged, and the $12.0 million term loan commitment earmarked for capital expenditures was increased to $30.0 million.  Any undrawn Capex Commitments will expire on the third anniversary of the execution of the agreement. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the commitments for the Revolving Facility may be increased up to $20.0 million subject to certain conditions.  The Loan Agreement provides for the maintenance of various covenants, including financial covenants, and includes events of default that are customary for facilities of this type.  
 Any borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates depending on our election, either at a base rate or at LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The initial applicable margin is 3.75% for base rate loans and 4.75% for LIBOR loans. Thereafter, subject to our leverage ratio, the applicable base rate margin will vary from 2.75% and 3.75% and the applicable LIBOR rate margin will vary from 3.75% and 4.75%. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets. The Loan Agreement provides for the maintenance of various covenants, including financial covenants.  The Loan Agreement includes events of default that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants in the Loan Agreement and had $9.0 million in debt outstanding under the Credit Facilities. There was no accrued interest as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Interest expense and fees totaled $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Interest expense and fees totaled $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no material changes to our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Form 10-K, with the exception of borrowings under our Credit Facilities, accrued leadership transition costs, and our corporate lease. The Accrued leadership transition costs of $0.6 million are due in less than one year, and less than $0.1 million is due between one and three years. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities of $9.0 million are due between three and five years. Our corporate lease was renewed in July 2016. Obligations under this lease are $0.9 million between one and three years, $1.0 million between three and five years, and $1.4 million beyond five years. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off balance sheet arrangements or any holdings in variable interest entities. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates  
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Form 10-K.  
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   In May 2014, the Financing Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU  No. 2014-09  to fiscal  
 26 

years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is only permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retr  ospective or cumulative effect transition method. The FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 regarding identification of performance obligations and licensing considerations and ASU No. 2016-12 regarding narrow scope improvements and practical expedients. The Co  mpany is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial r  eporting.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  which requires that debt issuance cost be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This new guidance was adopted beginning January 1, 2016 and did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements other than presentation. 
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which requires that an entity carry its inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value (which replaces  lower of cost or market ) if the first-in first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost methods are used. This new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. The impact of ASU No. 2015-11 will depend on future valuation of the Company s inventory. 
   
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The new guidance was adopted beginning January 1, 2016. The effects of ASU 2015-17 will change retrospectively how deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified within the balance sheet and notes thereto. Due to the Company s full valuation allowance, deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases,  which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its corporate office lease, and upon adoption of this guidance, expects to record the lease on its consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations,  which clarifies the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements under ASU No. 2014-09. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt this amendment in the second quarter of 2016. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. The impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income/(Loss) was not material. The amendments related to excess tax benefits are not material due to the Company s net operating losses. 
   
 In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, such as proceeds from insurance claims. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company accounts for all applicable cash flows in accordance with this guidance and does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and financial statement disclosures.

I  tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks   
   
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are sometimes exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements, which bears interest at variable rates. As of September 30, 2016, we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities of which $9.0 million was outstanding as at September 30, 2016. A change in interest rates of 100 basis points would cause a $0.1 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense. 
   
 Commodity Price Risk  
   
 We purchase certain products that are affected by commodity prices and are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control. In many cases, we believe we will be able to address material commodity cost increases by either increasing prices or reducing operating expenses. However, increases in commodity prices, without adjustments to pricing or reduction to operating expenses, could increase our operating costs as a percentage of our net sales. 

28 

I  tem 4. Controls and Procedures   
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control  
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

P  ART II OTHER INFORMATION   
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
 The Company has become aware through press releases issued between April 21 and April 27, 2016, that a securities lawsuit, Curran v. Freshpet, Inc. et al, Docket No. 2:16-cv-02263 (D.N.J. Apr 21, 2016), has been filed against us and certain of our executive officers and directors on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. The lawsuit purportedly seeks to recover damages for investors under the federal securities laws. We have not been served with a copy of the complaint. The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Because the Company is in the early stages of this litigation matter, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
   
 In addition, we are currently involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including claims resulting from employment related matters. None of these claims or proceedings, most of which are covered by insurance, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
     Item 1A. Risk Factors  
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
