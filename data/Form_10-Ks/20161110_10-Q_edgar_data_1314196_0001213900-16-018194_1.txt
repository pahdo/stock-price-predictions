NOTE 1 - BACKGROUND  

The Company incorporated in the State of Delaware on
November 18, 2004 for the purpose of merging with OLB.com (On-line Business), Inc., a New York corporation incorporated in 1993
( OLB.com ). The merger was done for the purpose of changing our state of incorporation from New York to Delaware. 

As result of the merger, the Company acquired all of
the assets of OLB.com, including its intellectual property assets. In connection with the merger, each of the former common and
preferred stockholders of OLB.com received five shares of our common stock in exchange for each outstanding share of OLB.com 

We currently offer monthly subscription packages which
includes a health benefits package. These arrangements are generally renewable monthly and revenue is recognized over the renewal
period.  

We also provide ecommerce development and consulting
services on a project by project basis. 

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation   

 The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. In the opinion of management all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary
for a full presentation have been included. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included on the Company s Form 10-K. The results
of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending
December 31, 2016. 

Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible
for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control, and preventing and
detecting fraud. Our system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that: (1) recorded transactions
are valid; (2) valid transactions are recorded; and (3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce
financial statements that present fairly our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the respective periods
being presented. 

Liquidity and Dependency of Related Parties   

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had minimal
revenue and a working capital deficiency of $257,906. 

One of our Directors and his affiliated company
has funded the Company with related party loans, most of which have all been converted to common stock. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, another $110,000 was loaned to the Company (Note 3). The Company plans to continue to use the financial
resources of its related parties in the future, if necessary; however, there are no assurances that the Director, or the Company,
will be in a financial position to do so.  Despite the fact that the Director has confirmed in writing his intention
to provide financial support, the Company does not have any written agreements now or in the past with the Director obligating
him to fund the future debt or any other obligations.  The Director is not otherwise under any legal obligation to provide
the Company with capital. 

If the Director withdraws his financial support
to enable the company to fund its current activities, management will be required to reduce the Company s cash from operations
by reducing operating costs. In addition, the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while it continues to make changes
in operations to further improve its cash flow and liquidity position. Based upon current cash flow projections, management believes
the Company will have sufficient capital resources to meet projected cash flow requirements through the year ended 2016. 

Use of Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Revenue and cost recognition   

 The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable
and earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Revenue is accounted for gross as a principal versus
net as an agent. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis since our company has the risks and rewards of ownership, latitude in selection
of vendors and pricing, and bears all credit risk. 

Costs are recorded at the time the related revenue
is recorded. Payment processing costs are recorded in the period the costs are incurred and customer acquisition costs are comprised
primarily of telemarketing costs and service costs and other additional benefit services. 

Membership Fees   

 The Company recognizes revenues from membership fees
for the sales of health-related discount benefit plans as earned as part of the ShopFast program. These arrangements are generally
renewable monthly and revenue is recognized over the renewal period.  As these products often include elements sold through
contracts with third-party providers, the Company considers each contractual arrangement in accordance with the Revenue Recognition
topic of the FASB ASC 605. The Company s current contracts meet these requirements for reporting revenue on a gross basis.
The Company records a reduction in revenue for refunds, chargeback s from credit card companies, and allowances based upon
actual history and management s evaluation of current facts and circumstances. 

Stock-based Compensation   

 We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees
under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  ( ASC 505-50 ). ASC 505-50
establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued
for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other
than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the
equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract. 

We account for employee stock-based compensation in
accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation,  which requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their
fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in
capital over the period during which services are rendered. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 The Company has reviewed other recently issued accounting
pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the adoption of any other pronouncements
to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.  

NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Mr. John Herzog,
a majority shareholder, loaned the Company a total of $110,000. The loans are unsecured, are current and due at any time. The notes
accrue interest at 18%. 12% of the interest is due and payable by direct deposit on the last day of each month. The remaining 6%
is  due at  Maturity .  

Forward-Looking Statements  

The information in this report contains forward-looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made in report are forward looking. In particular, the statements
herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  believes,   estimates,   could, 
 possibly,   probably,  anticipates,   projects,   expects,   may, 
 will,  or  should  or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results
anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations
and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations. 

The following discussion and analysis should be read
in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that
the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily
be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management. 

Item 2:  Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan
of Operation  

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes to the unaudited
financial statements included elsewhere in this filing as well as with Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations
contained in the Company s Report on Form 10-Q, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.   

Company Overview and Description of Business  

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November
18, 2004 for the purpose of merging with OLB.com (On-line Business), Inc., a New York corporation incorporated in 1993 ( OLB.com ).
The merger was done for the purpose of changing our state of incorporation from New York to Delaware. 

As a result of the merger, we acquired all of the assets
of OLB.com, including its intellectual property. In connection with the merger, each of the former common and preferred stockholders
of OLB.com received five shares of our common stock in exchange for each outstanding share of OLB.com common and preferred stock
and, in addition, the former holders of the Series A stock of OLB.com received one warrant for each such preferred share and the
former holders of the Series B Preferred Stock of OLB.com received two warrants for each such preferred share, to purchase shares
of our common stock. An aggregate of 1,345,098 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the merger. 

We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. We currently have 13,479,297
shares of common stock issued and outstanding. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. 

Our Business  

We currently offer monthly subscription packages which
includes a health benefits package. These arrangements are generally renewable monthly and revenue is recognized over the renewal
period.   

We also provide ecommerce development and consulting
services on a project by project basis. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

REVENUE  

Revenue from our subscription program for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $7,259 to $8,152 from $15,411 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
can be attributed to fewer subscribers to our insurance program and lower premiums for some in the third quarter of the year. 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

General and administrative expenses decreased $2,690,
to $20,976 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $23,666 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE 

Interest expense decreased from $4,513 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to $2,972 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Interest expense is from our related party
loans. 

NET LOSS  

Net loss increased $1,636 from a loss of $88,132 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, to a loss of $89,768 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

REVENUE  

Revenue from our subscription program for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $3,143 to $39,789 from $42,932 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
can be attributed to fewer subscribers to our insurance program. 

Revenue from software development services
that were provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $13,656 compared to $2,500 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Software development and/or enhancements are performed periodically by specific request and therefore the revenue is
irregular by nature. 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

General and administrative expenses decreased $10,329,
to $70,505 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $80,834 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. A majority of
G A expense consists of professional fees and travel expense. 

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE 

Interest expense decreased from $7,013 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 to $3,317 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Interest expense is from our related party
loans. 

NET LOSS  

Net loss decreased $26,279 from a loss of $268,727
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to a loss of $242,448 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company used $111,186 of cash for operating activities, as compared to $151,559 cash used through the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Net cash provided from financing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $110,000 as compared to $152,687 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

As discussed in Note 2, our Chairman and a significant
shareholder have funded the Company with related party loans, most of which have all been converted to common stock. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, another $110,000 was loaned to the Company (Note 3). The Company plans to use the financial
resources of its related parties in the future. Despite the fact that the related parties have confirmed in writing the intention
to provide financial support, the Company does not have any binding agreements now or in the past with the related parties obligating
them to fund the future debt or any other obligations.  The related parties are not otherwise under any legal obligation
to provide the Company with capital. 

If the related parties withdraw their financial support
to enable the company to fund its current activities, management will be required to reduce the Company s cash from operations
by reducing operating costs. In addition, the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while it continues to make changes
in operations to further improve its cash flow and liquidity position. Based upon current cash flow projections, management believes
the Company will have sufficient capital resources to meet projected cash flow requirements through the next twelve months.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures
on the date of the financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including, but not limited to, those related
to revenue recognition. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making
judgments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect
our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Revenue  

The Company recognizes revenue on its Omni Commerce
Solution licensing when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 

Costs are recorded at the time the related revenue
is recorded. Payment processing costs are recorded in the period the costs are incurred and customer acquisition costs are comprised
primarily of telemarketing costs and service costs and other additional benefit services. 

Membership Fees  

The Company recognizes revenues from membership fees
for the sales of health-related discount benefit plans as earned as part of the ShopFast program. These arrangements are generally
renewable monthly and revenue is recognized over the renewal period. As these products often include elements sold through contracts
with third-party providers, the Company considers each contractual arrangement in accordance with the Revenue Recognition topic
of the FASB ASC 605. The Company s current contracts meet these requirements for reporting revenue on a gross basis. The
Company records a reduction in revenue for refunds, chargeback s from credit card companies, and allowances based upon actual
history and management s evaluation of current facts and circumstances. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Control and Procedures  

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Interim Chief Financial Officer. 

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Interim Financial officer as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

Management s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting  

Internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive
and principal financial officers, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over our financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting using the  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  developed by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Financial Officer have
concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

We are aware of the following material weaknesses in
internal control that could adversely affect the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data: 

Due to the size of the Company we lack the personnel
to maintain an adequate level of separation of duties. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There has been no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to material
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
