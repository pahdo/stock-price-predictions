2. Basis of Presentation 
 The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position for the interim periods presented, and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  The results are not necessarily indicative of future results.  The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. 

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the emerging issues task force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ). This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized cost at the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses.  The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be applied using a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.   
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The updated guidance revises aspects of stock-based compensation guidance which include income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The ASU requires management to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all operating leases. The ASU is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods therein on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customer  s   ( ASU 2014-09 )  .   ASU 2014-09 provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers. The five steps are to (i) identify the contracts with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contact, (iii) determine th  e transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to t  he customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and to permit early adoption by entities as of the original eff  ective dates. Considering the one year deferral, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company is continuing to eval  uate the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and the presentation of our   consolidated   financial statements.  

4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2- Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived     

Level 3- Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.     

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 The carrying values of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, cash equivalents, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value. Debt under the Company s 2015 Credit Agreement approximates the fair value due to the variable rate nature at current market rates. 
 The carrying amount of the 2.75% Convertible Notes (the  Convertible Notes ) was $85 million at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $101.6 million and $91.7 million, respectively, based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the Convertible Notes (Level 2). 
 Included in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are money market fund investments of $0.3 million, which are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices for such investments (Level 1).

6. Net Income per Share 
 Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Common stock equivalents are included in the per share calculations when the effect of their inclusion is dilutive. 
 The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted net income per share: 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company s common stock price exceeded the current conversion price of the Company s Convertible Notes, resulting in additional shares being included in net income per common share in the diluted earnings per share calculation above. 

7. Inventories

 The estimated amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $2.0 million for the remainder of 2016, $8.3 million in each of the next four years and then $16.1 million thereafter. 

9. Warranty Costs 
 The contractual warranty period of the Company's products generally ranges from three months to two years with certain warranties extending for longer periods. Estimated expenses related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold to customers and are recorded in accruals and other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. Estimates are established using historical information as to the nature, frequency and average costs of warranty claims. Changes in the carrying amount of accrued product warranty costs for each of the year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are as follows:

Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 
 On October 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V. ( Altra Netherlands ), one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the  Borrowers ), the lenders party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the  Lenders ), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the  Administrative Agent ), to be guaranteed through a Guarantee Agreement by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company (each a  Guarantor  and collectively the  Guarantors  the Guarantors collectively with the Borrowers, the  Loan Parties ), and which may be amended from time to time (the  2015 Credit Agreement ). The 2015 Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s former Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2013, as amended (the  2013 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company, and certain of its domestic subsidiaries, including former subsidiary Altra Power Transmission, Inc., the lenders party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (the  Former Lenders ), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and the Administrative Agent, guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The 2013 Credit Agreement itself was an amendment and restatement of a prior credit agreement. Pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Former Lenders had made available to the Borrowers a revolving credit facility (the  Prior Revolving Credit Facility ) of $200 million, which continued in effect an existing term loan then having a balance of approximately $94 million, and made an additional term loan of  50 million to Altra Netherlands. The two term loans described in the prior sentence are collectively referred to as the  Term Loans.  
 Under the 2015 Credit Agreement, the amount of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility was increased to $350 million (the  2015 Revolving Credit Facility ). The amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and to repay existing indebtedness. A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was used to repay the Term Loans. The Company wrote off approximately $0.5 million of previously recognized deferred financing costs in connection with the repayment. 
 The stated maturity of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was extended to October 22, 2020. The maturity of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility had been December 6, 2018. The 2015 Credit Agreement continues to provide for a possible expansion of the credit facilities by an additional $150 million, which can be allocated as additional term loans and/or additional revolving credit loans. 
   The amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility are due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurodollar Rate, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margins for Eurodollar Loans are between 1.25% to 2.00%, and for ABR Loans are between 0.25% and 1.00%. The amounts of the  
 12 
 
 ALTRA INDUSTRIAL MOTION CORP. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements 
 Amounts in thousands, unless otherwise noted 
   
  margins are calculated based on either a consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement), or the then applicable rating(s) of the Company s debt and then to the extent as provided i  n the 2015 Credit Agreement. The rate at December 31, 2015 was 1.5%.  A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may also be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is available for   borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, will require the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders,   require the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage and interest coverage, limit maximum annual capital expenditures, and limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional inde  btedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. The 2015 Credit Agreement also contains custo  mary events of default.   
 Ratification Agreement 
 Pursuant to an Omnibus Reaffirmation and Ratification and Amendment of Collateral Documents entered into on October 22, 2015 in connection with the 2015 Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent (the  Ratification Agreement ), the Loan Parties (exclusive of the foreign subsidiary Borrower) have reaffirmed their obligations to the Lenders under the Pledge and Security Agreement dated November 20, 2012 (the  Pledge and Security Agreement ), pursuant to which each Loan Party pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all personal property, whether now owned by or owing to, or after acquired by or arising in favor of such Loan Party (including under any trade name or derivations), and whether owned or consigned by or to, or leased from or to, such Loan Party, and regardless of where located, except for specific excluded personal property identified in the Pledge and Security Agreement (collectively, the  Collateral ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral does not include, among other items, more than 65% of the capital stock of the first tier foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The Pledge and Security Agreement contains other customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. The 2015 Credit Agreement provides that the obligation to grant the security interest can cease upon the obtaining of certain corporate family credit ratings for the Company, but the obligation to grant a security interest is subject to subsequent reinstatement if the ratings are not maintained as provided in the 2015 Credit Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Ratification Agreement, the Loan Parties (other than the foregoing subsidiary Borrower) have also reaffirmed their obligations under each of the Patent Security Agreement and a Trademark Security Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent dated November 20, 2012 (the  2012 Security Agreements ) pursuant to which each of the Loan Parties signatory thereto pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all registered patents, patent applications, registered trademarks and trademark applications owned by such Loan Parties. 
 Additional Trademark Security Agreement and Patent Security Agreement 
 In connection with the reaffirmation of the Pledge and Security Agreement, certain of the Loan Parties delivered a new Patent Security Agreement and a new Trademark Security Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to which each of the Loan Parties signatory thereto pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all registered patents, patent applications, registered trademarks and trademark applications owned by such Loan Parties and not covered by the 2012 Security Agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2016 we had $117.5 million outstanding on our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, including $109.2 million outstanding on our USD tranche at an interest rate of 2.0% and $8.3 million outstanding on our Euro tranche at an interest rate of 1.5%. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $4.1 million and $7.0 million in letters of credit outstanding, respectively. We had $228.4 million available to borrow under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2016. 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 In March 2011, the Company issued the Convertible Notes due March 1, 2031. The Convertible Notes are guaranteed by the Company s U.S. domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2011 at an annual rate of 2.75%. Proceeds from the offering were $81.3 million, net of fees and expenses that were capitalized. The proceeds from the offering were used to fund the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Danfoss Bauer GmbH relating to its gear motor business, as well as bolster the Company s cash position.

    The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2031, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased by the Company or converted, and are convertible into cash or shares, or a combination thereof, at the Company s election. The Convertible Notes a  re convertible into shares of the Company s common stock based on an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of 36.0985 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $27.70 per share of o  ur common stock), in certain circumstances. The conversion price at   S  e  ptember   30, 2016 is $  25.70   per share. Prior to March 1, 2030, the Convertible Notes are convertible only in the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after June 30, 2011 if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock is greater than or equ  al to 130% of the applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; (2) during the 5 business day period after any 10 consecutive trading da  y period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day in the measurement period was less than 97% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conver  sion rate on such trading day; (3) if the Convertible Notes have been called for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. On or after March 1, 2030, and ending at the close of business on the second business day immediate  ly preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination thereof  , at the Company s election. The Company intends to settle the principal amount in cash and any additional amounts in shares of stock.  
 If a fundamental change occurs, the Convertible Notes are redeemable at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest and additional interest, if any) to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Convertible Notes are also redeemable on each of March 1, 2018, March 1, 2021, and March 1, 2026 for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest and additional interest, if any) to, but excluding, the option repurchase date. 
 As of March 1, 2015, the Company may call all or part of the Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a  make-whole premium  payment in cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or combination thereof, at the Company s option, equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the Convertible Notes to be redeemed through March 1, 2018 to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date the Company provides notice of redemption exceeds 130% of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day. On or after March 1, 2018, the Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent and additional interest, if any) to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 The Company separately accounted for the debt and equity components of the Convertible Notes to reflect the issuer s non-convertible debt borrowing rate, which interest costs are to be recognized in subsequent periods. The note payable principal balance at the date of issuance of $85 million was bifurcated into a debt component of $60.5 million and an equity component of $24.5 million. The difference between the note payable principal balance and the value of the debt component is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the notes. The debt component was recognized at the present value of associated cash flows discounted using a 8.25% discount rate, the borrowing rate at the date of issuance for a similar debt instrument without a conversion feature. The Company paid approximately $3.7 million of issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes. The Company recorded $1.0 million of debt issuance costs as an offset to additional paid-in capital. The balance of $2.7 million of debt issuance costs is classified as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. 
 Because the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock did not exceed 130% of the current conversion price, which was $25.70, for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Convertible Notes are not convertible at the election of the holders of the Convertible Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016.  The future convertibility will be monitored at each quarterly reporting date and will be analyzed dependent upon market prices of the Company s common stock during the prescribed measurement periods.

11. Stockholders  Equity 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan ) permitted the grant of various forms of stock based compensation to our officers and senior level employees. The 2004 Plan expired in 2014 and, upon expiration, there were 750,576 shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2004 Plan. The 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) was approved by the Company s shareholders at its 2014 annual meeting. The 2014 Plan provides for various forms of stock based compensation to our directors, executive personnel and other key employees and consultants. Under the 2014 Plan, the total number of shares of common stock available for delivery pursuant to the grant of awards ( Awards ) was originally 750,000. Shares of our common stock subject to Awards awarded under the 2004 Plan and outstanding as of the effective date of the 2014 Plan (except for substitute awards) that terminate without being exercised, expire, are forfeited or canceled, are exchanged for Awards that did not involve shares of common stock, are not issued on the stock settlement of a stock appreciation right, are withheld by the Company or tendered by a participant (either actually or by attestation) to pay an option exercise price or to pay the withholding tax on any Award, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares will again be available for Awards under the 2014 Plan. 
 The restricted shares issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan generally vest ratably over a period ranging from immediately to five years from the date of grant, provided, that the vesting of the restricted shares may accelerate upon the occurrence of certain events. Common stock awarded under the 2014 Plan is generally subject to restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights, and other limitations and rights as set forth in the applicable award agreements. The shares are valued based on the share price on the date of grant. 
 The 2014 Plan permits the Company to grant, among other things, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share awards to key employees and other persons who make significant contributions to the success of the Company. The restrictions and vesting schedule for restricted stock granted under the 2014 Plan are determined by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Stock-based compensation expense recorded during the year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was $3.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively.  The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for the shares vesting ratably under the plan and uses the graded-vesting method of recognizing stock-based compensation expense for the performance share awards based on the probability of the specific performance metrics being achieved over the requisite service period.

    The following table sets forth the activity of the Company s restricted stock and performance share grants in the year to date period ended September 30, 2016:  

Total remaining unrecognized compensation cost was $4.9 million as of September 30, 2016, which will be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of 3 years. The fair market value of the shares for which the restrictions have lapsed during the year to date period ended September 30, 2016 was $3.7 million. Restricted shares granted are valued based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In May 2014, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the buyback of up to $50.0 million of the Company s common stock. Under the program, the Company may purchase shares on the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with SEC Rule 10b-18 (including through Rule 10b5-1 plans), or in any other appropriate manner. The timing of the shares repurchased will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including price, market conditions and regulatory requirements. Shares acquired through the repurchase program will be retired. The Company retains the right to limit, terminate or extend the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 5,461 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $27.45 per share. As of September 30, 2016, up to $10.5 million was available to purchase additional shares under the repurchase program, which was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016.  On October 19, 2016, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the buyback of up to $30.0 million of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2019. This plan replaces the previous share repurchase program that was initiated in May 2014 and has now been terminated. The Company expects to purchase shares on the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with SEC Rule 10b-18 (including through Rule 10b5-1 plans), or in any other appropriate manner. The timing of the shares repurchased will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including price, market conditions and regulatory requirements. Shares acquired through the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Company retains the right to limit, terminate or extend the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.  The Company expects to fund any further repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated by operations. 
 Dividends 
 The Company declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock related to the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was accrued in the balance sheet at September 30, 2016.    
 Future declarations of quarterly cash dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and to the Board s continuing determination that the declaration of dividends are in the best interest of the Company s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. 

12. Restructuring, Asset Impairment, and Transition Expenses 
 From time to time, the Company has initiated various restructuring programs and incurred severance and other restructuring costs. 
   In the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company commenced a restructuring plan ( 2015 Altra Plan ) as a result of weak demand in Europe and to make certain adjustments to improve business effectiveness, reduce the number of facilities and streamline

  the Company's cost structure. The actions taken pursuant to the 2015 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and related asset impairments  , and limiting discretionary spending to improve profitability.  
 The following table details restructuring charges incurred by segment for the periods presented. 

The amounts for the year to date period ended September 30, 2016 are comprised of approximately $2.0 million in severance, $0.7 million in consolidation costs, $2.4 million in moving and relocation costs, $0.7 million in building impairments, and $0.8 million in travel-related and other restructuring costs. The amounts for the year to date period ended September 30, 2015 were limited to severance costs related to staff reductions, moving costs and plant closures and are classified in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income as restructuring costs. 
 The following is a reconciliation of the accrued restructuring costs between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016: 

The total restructuring reserve as of September 30, 2016 relates to severance costs to be paid to employees and is recorded in accruals and other current liabilities on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet which are expected to be paid during 2016.  The Company expects to incur between approximately $7.0 - $9.0 million in additional restructuring expenses between 2016 and 2018 under the 2015 Altra Plan, primarily in the Couplings, Clutches   Brakes and Gearing business segments. 

13. Segments, Concentrations and Geographic Information 
 Segments 
 The Company currently operates through three business segments that are aligned with key product types and end markets served: 

Couplings, Clutches   Brakes.     

 Couplings are the interface between two shafts, which enable power to be transmitted from one shaft to the other. Clutches in this segment are devices which use mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or friction type connections to facilitate engaging or disengaging two rotating members. Brakes are combinations of interacting parts that work to slow or stop machinery. Products in this segment are generally used in heavy industrial applications and energy markets. 

Electromagnetic Clutches   Brakes.     

 Products in this segment include brakes and clutches that are used to electronically slow, stop, engage or disengage equipment utilizing electromagnetic friction type connections.   Products in this segment are used in industrial and commercial markets including agricultural machinery, material handling, motion control, and turf   garden. 

Gearing.     

 Gears are utilized to reduce the speed and increase the torque of an electric motor or engine to the level required to drive a particular piece of equipment.  Gears produced by the Company are primarily utilized in industrial applications.

 Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, tax related asset accounts, certain capitalized software costs, property, plant and equipment and deferred financing costs.    

 Net sales to third parties by geographic region are as follows: 

Net sales to third parties are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country in which the shipment originates. 
 Concentrations 
 Financial instruments, which are potentially subject to counter party performance and concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. The Company manages these risks by conducting credit evaluations of customers prior to delivery or commencement of services. When the Company enters into a sales contract, collateral is normally not required from the customer. Payments are typically due within 30 days of billing. An allowance for potential credit losses is maintained, and losses have historically been within management s expectations. While the Company did not have any customers that represented total sales greater than 10% for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Gearing business had one customer that approximated 10% of total sales for that segment during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
 The Company is also subject to counter party performance risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, such as cash and investments. Cash and cash equivalents are held by well-established financial institutions and invested in AAA rated mutual funds. The Company is exposed to swap counterparty credit risk with well-established financial institutions. 

14. Commitments and Contingencies 
 General Litigation 
 The Company is involved in various pending legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business. These proceedings primarily involve commercial claims, product liability claims, personal injury claims, and workers  compensation claims. None of these legal proceedings are expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Company. Wi th respect to these proceedings, management believes that the Company will prevail, has adequate insurance coverage or has established appropriate reserves to cover potential liabilities. Any costs that management estimates may be paid related to these proceedings or claims are accrued when the liability is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. There can be no assurance, however, as to the ultimate outcome of any of these matters, and if all or substantially all of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to the Company, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Company. We have established loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. There were no material amounts accrued in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet for potential litigation as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. For matters where a reserve has not been established and for which we believe a loss is reasonably possible, as well as for matters where a reserve has been recorded but for which an exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible, we believe that such losses, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
   The Company also risks exposure to product liability claims in connection with products it has sold and those sold by businesses that the Company acquired. Although in some cases third parties have retained responsibility for product liability claims relating to products manufactured or sold prior to the acquisition of the relevant business and in other cases the persons from whom  
 20 
 
 ALTRA INDUSTRIAL MOTION CORP. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements 
 Amounts in thousands, unless otherwise noted 
   
  the Company has acquired a business may be required to indemnify the Company for certain   product liability claims subject to certain caps or limitations on indemnification, the Company cannot assure that those third parties will in fact satisfy their obligations with respect to liabilities retained by them or their indemnification obligations.   If those third parties become unable to or otherwise do not comply with their respective obligations including indemnity obligations, or if certain product liability claims for which the Company is obligated were not retained by third parties or are not s  ubject to these indemnities, the Company could become subject to significant liabilities or other adverse consequences. Moreover, even in cases where third parties retain responsibility for product liability claims or are required to indemnify the Company,   significant claims arising from products that have been acquired could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to realize the benefits from an acquisition, could result in the reduction of the value of goodwill that the Company recorded in   connection with an acquisition, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, or operations.  

15. Subsequent Events 
   
 Dividend 
 On October 19, 2016, the Company declared a dividend of $0.15 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, payable on January 4, 2017 to shareholders of record as of December 19, 2016.  
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On October 19, 2016, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the buyback of up to $30.0 million of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2019. This plan replaces the previous share repurchase program that was initiated in May 2014 and has now been terminated. The Company expects to purchase shares on the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with SEC Rule 10b-18 (including through Rule 10b5-1 plans), or in any other appropriate manner. The timing of the shares repurchased will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including price, market conditions and regulatory requirements. Shares acquired through the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Company retains the right to limit, terminate or extend the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund any repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated by operations. 
 Stromag Acquisition  
 On October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a binding agreement (the  French Agreement ) with GKN Industries, Limited ( GKN ).   The French Agreement provides that, subject to completion of certain employee consultation procedures required under applicable law and certain other customary conditions, the parties to the French Agreement will enter into a definitive sale and purchase agreement, attached as an exhibit to the French Agreement (the  Agreed Form Sale and Purchase Agreement ), providing for the sale and transfer of GKN s Germany-based Stromag AG business (the  Acquired Company ) for a purchase price comprised of the assumption of debt totaling 14 million euros and cash consideration, payable at closing, of approximately 184 million euros, subject to certain adjustments (the  Stromag Acquisition ). 
 Under the French Agreement, GKN has agreed to promptly commence the employee consultation process required under applicable law to obtain opinions of the Stromag works councils in France. Subject to the conditions set forth in the French Agreement, the parties to the French Agreement will execute and deliver the Agreed Form Sale and Purchase Agreement within two business days following the satisfaction of the employee consultation process requirements.  
 The French Agreement and the Agreed Form Sale and Purchase Agreement contain representations, warranties, and covenants that we believe are customary for a transaction of this size and type, as well as indemnification provisions subject to specified limitations. The closing of the transaction is subject to several customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, as well as the aforementioned consultation process with the Stromag works councils, and is expected to take place during the first quarter of 2017. No assurances can be given that the Stromag Acquisition will be timely consummated or consummated at all. 
 The foregoing summary of the French Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual French Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

    Amended and Restated Credit Agreement   
  On October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  First Amendment ) by and among the Company and Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V. ( Altra B.V. ), one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the  Borrowers ), the Subsidiary Guarantors to the First Amendment, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, KeyBank National Association, as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, and certain lender parties to the First Amendment (collectively, the  Lenders ).   
 The First Amendment would amend the Company s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2015 (the  Credit Agreement ). However, the amendments to the Credit Agreement contained in the First Amendment will not be effective and will not amend the Credit Agreement unless and until certain conditions precedent have been met, including that the Company has provided the Administrative Agent with written notice that the conditions precedent to the closing of the Stromag Acquisition have been satisfied. In the event that the Stromag Acquisition does not occur, or if the other conditions precedent are not satisfied or waived, then the First Amendment shall not become effective.  
 If it becomes effective, the First Amendment, would increase the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement by $75,000,000 (the  Revolver Increase ), so that after giving effect to the Revolver Increase, the aggregate revolving commitments would total $425,000,000. The First Amendment would also reset the possible expansion of additional future loan commitments to $150,000,000.  In addition, the First Amendment would increase the multicurrency sublimit to $250 million and adjust certain financial covenants. The Company expects to use the increased facility to finance the Stromag Acquisition. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the First Amendment, all of the respective terms, conditions and provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents remain the same. 
 The foregoing summary of the First Amendment and the transactions contemplated thereby is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual First Amendment, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

Grainger. 
 Business Segments 
 Segments 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company realigned its reporting and management structure and corresponding reportable business segments as part of its business simplification efforts. This new structure is better aligned across the Company s end markets and will better facilitate the Company s strategic initiatives for growth, procurement and facility consolidation. 
 The Company currently operates through three business segments that are aligned with key product types and end markets served: 

Couplings, Clutches   Brakes.     

 Couplings are the interface between two shafts, which enable power to be transmitted from one shaft to the other. Clutches in this segment are devices which use mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or friction type connections to facilitate engaging or disengaging two rotating members. Brakes are combinations of interacting parts that work to slow or stop machinery.  Products in this segment are generally used in heavy industrial applications and energy markets. 

Electromagnetic Clutches   Brakes.     

 Products in this segment include brakes and clutches that are used to electronically slow, stop, engage or disengage equipment utilizing electromagnetic friction type connections.   Products in this segment are used in industrial and commercial markets including agricultural machinery, material handling, motion control, and turf   garden. 

Gearing.     

 Gears are utilized to reduce the speed and increase the torque of an electric motor or engine to the level required to drive a particular piece of equipment.  Gears produced by the Company are primarily utilized in industrial applications. 
 The following tables show the percentage of net sales and operating income generated by each of our three segments for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Securities and Exchange Commission. We are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Quarterly Repor  t on Form 10-Q.  
 Business Outlook 
 Our future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on the U.S., European, and global economies in general. 
 Foreign currency translation continues to have a negative impact on our performance, and several of our end markets remain weak. Performance in the oil   gas, agriculture, mining and metals end markets, which are some of our largest markets, remains challenging and continues to weigh on our performance. Furthermore, we expect the challenges in our agriculture, oil and gas, mining and metals end markets to continue for some time. 
 As these conditions persist, we are managing the business to the level of demand we are seeing. We expect ongoing benefits from the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives which include actions taken under the 2015 Altra Plan which we commenced in the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and which has also helped improve the profitability of our Gearing segment.  We had completed six facility consolidations by the end of the third quarter, and we are working to complete one additional consolidation during the remainder of the year. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experiences and other assumptions we believe to be appropriate, and we evaluate these estimates on an on-going basis. See the discussion of critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the reporting period, except as otherwise described below, there were no material changes to the critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Goodwill, Intangibles and other long-lived assets.     In connection with our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value. We recorded intangible assets for customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, product technology, patents and goodwill. In valuing the customer relationships, trade names, and trademarks, we utilized variations of the income approach. The income approach was considered the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. The income approach relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. Projected financial information is subject to risk if our estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to our projected revenues and profitability. If we do not meet the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations then the intangible assets could be impaired. In determining the value of customer relationships, we reviewed historical customer attrition rates which were determined to be approximately 5% per year. Most of our customers tend to be long-term customers with very little turnover. While we do not typically have long-term contracts with customers, we have established long-term relationships with customers which make it difficult for competitors to displace us. Additionally, we assessed historical revenue growth within our industry and customers  industries in determining the value of customer relationships. The value of our customer relationships intangible asset could become impaired if future results differ significantly from any of the underlying assumptions. This could include a higher customer attrition rate or a change in industry trends such as the use of long-term contracts which we may not be able to obtain successfully. Customer relationships and product technology and patents are considered finite-lived assets, with estimated lives ranging from 8 years to 17 years. The estimated lives were determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95% of the value of the discounted cash flows of the respective intangible asset.   
   
 Goodwill and trade names and trademarks are considered indefinite lived assets. Other intangible assets include trade names and trademarks that identify us and differentiate us from competitors, and therefore competition does not limit the useful life of these assets. Additionally, we believe that our trade names and trademarks will continue to generate product sales for an indefinite period. 
   
 Accounting standards require that an annual goodwill impairment assessment be conducted at the reporting unit level using either a quantitative or qualitative approach. The Company has determined that its Couplings, Clutches, and Brakes (CCB) operating segment is comprised of two reporting units which are the Couplings reporting unit and the Heavy Duty and Overrunning Clutches and Brakes reporting unit. The Company has determined that its Gearing operating segment is comprised of two reporting units which are the Domestic Gearing reporting unit and the Bauer Gearing reporting unit. The Company has also determined that the Electromagnetic, Clutches and Brakes (ECB) operating segment comprises a single reporting unit.  
   
 26 

As part of the annual goodwill impairmen  t assessment we performed a quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our five reporting units using an income approach. We forecasted future cash flows by reporting unit for each of the next five years and applied a long term growth   rate to the final year of forecasted cash flows. The cash flows were then discounted using our estimated discount rate. The forecasts of revenue and profitability growth for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate were the key assumptions in our g  oodwill fair value analysis.   
   
 As of December 31, 2015, each of our reporting units had estimated fair values that were substantially in excess of the carrying value. 
   
 Management believes the preparation of revenue and profitability growth rates for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate requires significant use of judgment. If any of our operating segments do not meet our forecasted revenue and/or profitability estimates, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis in future periods. In addition, if our discount rate increases, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. Given the substantial excess fair value, we believe that a significant change in key valuation assumptions, including a decrease in revenues or profitability, or an increase in the discount rate, would not result in an indication of impairment.  
   
 Based on the above procedures, we did not identify any reporting unit that would be required to perform a step 2 goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2015. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the emerging issues task force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ). This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  The main provisions include presenting financial assets measured at amortized cost at the amount expected to be collected, which is net of an allowance for credit losses, and recording credit losses related to available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses.  The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and must be applied using a modified retrospective approach with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.   
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The updated guidance revises aspects of stock-based compensation guidance which include income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The ASU requires management to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all operating leases. The ASU is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods therein on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements. 
   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers. The five steps are to (i) identify the contracts with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contact, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date of ASU  
 27 

2014-09 for one year and to permit early adoption by entities as of the original effective dates. Considering the one year deferral, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and the standard allows for either full re  trospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and the presentation of our financial statements.  
 Results of Operations 
 (Amounts in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 

Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2015 
 (Amounts in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 

The decrease in sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was due to the effect of foreign exchange rates, and lower sales levels in several end markets.  Of the decrease in sales, approximately $2.8 million relates to the impact of changes to foreign exchange rates primarily for the Chinese Renminbi and British Pound compared to the prior year.  In addition, $4.3 million relates to decreased sales in various end markets, primarily oil and gas, and mining in our Couplings, Clutches and Brakes business segment and agriculture in our Electromagnetic Clutches and Brakes business segment. 

28 

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The increase is due to improvements realized from our consolidation and cost saving efforts, partially offset by unf  avorable product mix   and redundant   labor costs associated with   ongoing   consolidation activities  .  We expect the gross profit as a percentage of sales will remain relatively consistent for the remainder of 2016.  

The increase in SG A as a percent of sales relates primarily to the impact of acquisition costs of $1.1 million during the period ended September 30, 2016 not present during the same period in the prior year.  

R D remained consistent compared to the prior year. We continue to expect R D expenses to approximate 2.0% - 2.5% of sales in future periods. 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company adopted a restructuring plan ( 2015 Altra Plan ) in response to weak demand and to make certain adjustments to improve business effectiveness, reduce the number of facilities and streamline the Company s cost structure. The actions taken pursuant to the 2015 Altra Plan included reducing headcount and limiting discretionary spending to improve profitability. Approximately $3.0 million, $0.2 million, and $0.1 million were related to the Couplings, Clutches and Brakes segment, Electromagnetic Clutches and Brakes segment, and Corporate business segments, respectively. The Company expects to incur approximately $7.0 - $9.0 million in additional expenses associated with the 2015 Altra Plan through 2018. We expect to realize cost savings of approximately $0.5 million related to these actions during the remainder of 2016. 

Net interest expense remained relatively consistent between 2015 and 2016.  

Other non-operating expense in each period in the chart above relates primarily to foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates related to the Euro, British Pound, and Chinese Renminbi. 

The provision for income tax, as a percentage of income before taxes, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was higher than that of the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The Company benefited from a foreign tax credit of approximately $0.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that was not present in the current quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
 29 

Year to Date Ended September 30, 2016 compared with Year to Date Ended September 30, 2015 
 (Amounts in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 

The decrease in sales during the year to date period ended September 30, 2016 was due to weaker foreign exchange rates, and lower sales levels in several end markets. Of the decrease in sales, approximately $6.8 million relates to the impact of changes to foreign exchange rates primarily attributed to the Euro, British Pound, and Chinese Renminbi compared to the prior year.  In addition, $29.8 million relates to decreases in sales in the oil   gas, mining, and agriculture end markets. 

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased slightly during the year to date period ended September 30, 2016. The increase is due to improvements realized from our consolidation and cost saving efforts, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and redundant labor costs associated with ongoing consolidation activities. 

The decrease in SG A costs primarily relates to the impact of changes to foreign exchange rates primarily offset by an increase in acquisition costs.  

R D remained consistent compared to the prior year. We continue to expect R D expenses to approximate 2.0% - 2.5% of sales in future periods. 

Approximately $4.4 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million of the restructuring costs, associated with the 2015 Altra Plan, were related to the Couplings, Clutches and Brakes, Electromagnetic Clutches and Brakes, and Corporate, respectively. 

30 

Net interest expense remained relatively consistent with the comparable 2015 period.  

Other non-operating expense in each period in the chart above relates primarily to foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates related to the Euro, British Pound, and Chinese Renminbi. 

The increase in the provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, for the year to date period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year to date period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to the favorable discrete item in 2015 of $0.9 million related to a foreign tax credit that was not present in the current quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
 Segment Performance. 
 Amounts in thousands, except percentage data 

(1)   
 
 Certain expenses are maintained at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments. These include various administrative expenses related to the corporate headquarters, depreciation on capitalized software costs, non-capitalizable software implementation costs and acquisition related expenses.    

 Couplings, Clutches   Brakes 
 Net sales in the Couplings, Clutches   Brakes segment were $77.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $8.3 million or 10.0%, from the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Approximately $1.7 million of the decrease was due to the impact of changes to foreign exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound and Chinese Renminbi compared to the prior year.  The remainder of the decrease was due primarily to weakness in the oil and gas, metals and mining markets.  Segment operating income decreased approximately $5.5 million compared to the prior period primarily as a result of the impact of the decrease in sales described above. 
 Electromagnetic Clutches   Brakes 
   Net sales in the Electromagnetic Clutches   Brakes segment were $50.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $0.3 million, or 1.0%, from the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Segment operating  
 31 

income increased $  1  .  8   million compared to the prior period primarily as a result of the impact of the restructuring activities initiated during 2015   and e  arly 2016  .  
 Gearing 
 Net sales in the Gearing segment were $47.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared with $48.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1.8 million. This is primarily due to weakness in the Oil and Gas end market. Segment operating income decreased $0.6 million compared to the prior period primarily due to the impact of changes to foreign exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound and Chinese Renminbi. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We finance our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (defined below). We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pensions, dividends and share repurchases. In the event additional funds are needed for operations, we could borrow additional funds available under our existing Revolving Credit Facility, request an expansion by up to $150 million of the amount available to be borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement, attempt to secure new debt, attempt to refinance our loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement, or attempt to raise capital in the equity markets. As of September 30, 2016, we have the ability under our Revolving Credit Facility to borrow an additional $228.4 million based on current availability calculations. There can be no assurance however that additional debt financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Similarly, there can be no assurance that equity financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 
 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 
 On October 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V. ( Altra Netherlands ), one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the  Borrowers ), the lenders party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the  Lenders ), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the  Administrative Agent ), to be guaranteed through a Guarantee Agreement by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company (each a  Guarantor  and collectively the  Guarantors  the Guarantors collectively with the Borrowers, the  Loan Parties ), and which may be amended from time to time (the  2015 Credit Agreement ). The 2015 Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s former Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2013, as amended (the  2013 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company, and certain of its domestic subsidiaries, including former subsidiary Altra Power Transmission, Inc., the lenders party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (the  Former Lenders ), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and the Administrative Agent, guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The 2013 Credit Agreement itself was an amendment and restatement of a prior credit agreement. Pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Former Lenders had made available to the Borrowers a revolving credit facility (the  Prior Revolving Credit Facility ) of $200 million, continued in effect an existing term loan then having a balance of approximately $94 million, and made an additional term loan of  50.0 million to Altra Netherlands. The two term loans described in the prior sentence are collectively referred to as the  Term Loans . 
 Under the 2015 Credit Agreement, the amount of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility has been increased to $350 million (the  2015 Revolving Credit Facility ). The amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and to repay existing indebtedness. A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was used to repay the Term Loans. The Company wrote off approximately $0.5 million of financing costs in connection with the repayment. 
 The stated maturity of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was extended to October 22, 2020. The maturity of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility was December 6, 2018. The 2015 Credit Agreement continues to provide for a possible expansion of the credit facilities by an additional $150.0 million, which can be allocated as additional term loans and/or additional revolving credit loans. 
   The amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility are due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities is calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurodollar Rate, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margins for Eurodollar  
 32 

Loans are between 1.25% to 2.00%, and for ABR Loans are between 0.25% and 1.00%. The amounts of the margins are ca  lculated based on either a consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement), or the then applicable rating(s) of the Company s debt if and then to the extent as provided in the 2015 Credit Agreement. A portion of the 2015 Rev  olving Credit Facility may also be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is available for borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains vario  us affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, will require the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, require the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage   and interest coverage, limit maximum annual capital expenditures, and limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or   debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. The 2015 Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.   
 Ratification Agreement 
 Pursuant to an Omnibus Reaffirmation and Ratification and Amendment of Collateral Documents entered into on October 22, 2015 in connection with the 2015 Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent (the  Ratification Agreement ), the Loan Parties (exclusive of the foreign subsidiary Borrower) have reaffirmed their obligations to the Lenders under the Pledge and Security Agreement dated November 20, 2012 (the  Pledge and Security Agreement ), pursuant to which each Loan Party pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all personal property, whether now owned by or owing to, or after acquired by or arising in favor of such Loan Party (including under any trade name or derivations), and whether owned or consigned by or to, or leased from or to, such Loan Party, and regardless of where located, except for specific excluded personal property identified in the Pledge and Security Agreement (collectively, the  Collateral ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral does not include, among other items, more than 65% of the capital stock of the first tier foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The Pledge and Security Agreement contains other customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. The 2015 Credit Agreement provides that the obligation to grant the security interest can cease upon the obtaining of certain corporate family credit ratings for the Company, but the obligation to grant a security interest is subject to subsequent reinstatement if the ratings are not maintained as provided in the 2015 Credit Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Ratification Agreement, the Loan Parties (other than the foregoing subsidiary Borrower) have also reaffirmed their obligations under each of the Patent Security Agreement and a Trademark Security Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent dated November 20, 2012 (the  2012 Security Agreements ) pursuant to which each of the Loan Parties signatory thereto pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all registered patents, patent applications, registered trademarks and trademark applications owned by such Loan Parties. 
 Additional Trademark Security Agreement and Patent Security Agreement 
 In connection with the reaffirmation of the Pledge and Security Agreement, certain of the Loan Parties delivered a new Patent Security Agreement and a new Trademark Security Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to which each of the Loan Parties signatory thereto pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all registered patents, patent applications, registered trademarks and trademark applications owned by such Loan Parties and not covered by the 2012 Security Agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2016 we had $117.5 million outstanding on our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility.  As of December 31, 2015 we had $145.2 million outstanding on our Prior Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $4.1 million, and $7.0 million in letters of credit outstanding, respectively. We had $228.4 million available to borrow under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2016. On October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. See Part II   Item 5 of this Quarterly Report for details on the First Amendment.  
 We were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants of the indenture governing the 2015 Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016. 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 In March 2011, the Company issued Convertible Senior Notes (the  Convertible Notes ) due March 1, 2031. The Convertible Notes are guaranteed by the Company s U.S. domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2011 at an annual rate of 2.75%.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the year to date periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively: 

Cash Flows for 2016 
 Net cash provided from operating activities was approximately $46.9 million for the year to date period ended September 30, 2016. The net impact of the add-back of certain items including non-cash depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, accretion of debt discount, deferred financing costs, loss on impairment, and non-cash loss on foreign currency was approximately $26.9 million. Additionally, there was a net increase in current assets and liabilities of approximately $10.8 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately $2.3 million compared to the year to date period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is attributed to lower capital expenditure spend compared to prior year. 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 increased by $3.6 million. This increase relates primarily to the payment of debt under the Revolving Credit Facility partially offset by a decrease of $9.5 million in stock repurchases related to the Company s share repurchase program compared with the prior year period. 
 We intend to use our remaining existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations to provide for our working capital needs, to fund potential future acquisitions, debt service, including principal payments, capital expenditures, pension funding, and to pay returns to our stockholders. As of September 30, 2016 we have approximately $34.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries that are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs. Furthermore, the existing cash balances and the availability of additional borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.

Contractual Obligations  
 There were no material changes in our contractual obligations during the period ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

During the reporting period, there have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding our market risk set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2016, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-Q, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHE  R INFORMATION  
   Item 1.   Legal Proceedings 
 We are, from time to time, party to various legal proceedings arising out of our business. During the reporting period, there have been no material changes to the description of legal proceedings set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   Item 1A.   Risk Factors 
 The reader should carefully consider the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those risk factors described elsewhere in this report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not the only ones we face, but are considered to be the most material. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q and elsewhere. All risk factors stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 are incorporated herein by reference. 
 During the reporting period, except as otherwise described below, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
   
 Our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes. 
 Our Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning March 1, 2030 or, under certain circumstances including where our stock trades above 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time as set forth in the Convertible Notes, earlier. Upon conversion, we must deliver shares of our common stock or cash. The conversion rate of our Convertible Notes was initially 36.0985 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of our convertible notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $27.70 per share of common stock), and as of December 31, 2015 is 38.26 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of our convertible notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.13 per share of common stock), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Based on the current conversion rate, the maximum number of shares of common stock that could be issued upon conversion of the $85.0 million convertible debt currently outstanding is 3,252,363. In addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of our convertible notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance. In the event the average price of our stock exceeds the conversion price we will be required to include an additional amount of shares in our calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, in accordance with ASC 260-10-45-43 through 45-47, which will have the effect of decreasing our earnings per share. Currently, in the event the average price of our stock exceeds the conversion price, we will include an amount of shares equal to this excess, the conversion premium, in our calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding based on our application of ASC-260-10-45-43 through 45-47. 
   Item 2. Unregistere  d Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 The following table summarizes our share repurchase activity by month for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

(1)   
 
   During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased shares of common stock under its share repurchase program initiated in May 2014, which authorized the buyback of up to $50.0 million of the Company s common stock.  Under the program, the Company is authorized to purchase shares on the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with SEC Rule 10b-18 (including through Rule 10b5-1 plans), or in other appropriate manners. The Company has adopted a Rule 10b5-1 plan under which it is making purchases in compliance with the terms of such plan. The     

 36 

Company is also making open market share repurchases at the discretion of management.  Shares acquired thro  ugh the repurchase program will be retired. The share repurchase plan terminates on December 31, 2016.  The Company retains the right to limit, terminate or extend the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.     

   Item 3.   Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
   Item 4.   Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not Applicable. 
     Item 5. Other Information 
   
 Stromag Acquisition  
 On October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a binding agreement (the  French Agreement ) with GKN Industries, Limited ( GKN ). The French Agreement provides that, subject to completion of certain employee consultation procedures required under applicable law and certain other customary conditions, the parties to the French Agreement will enter into a definitive sale and purchase agreement, attached as an exhibit to the French Agreement (the  Agreed Form Sale and Purchase Agreement ), providing for the sale and transfer of GKN s Germany-based Stromag AG business (the  Acquired Company ) for a purchase price comprising of the assumption of debt totaling 14 million euros and cash consideration, payable at closing, of approximately 184 million euros, subject to certain adjustments (the  Stromag Acquisition ). 
 Under the French Agreement, GKN has agreed to promptly commence the employee consultation process required under applicable law to obtain opinions of the Stromag works councils in France. Subject to the conditions set forth in the French Agreement, the parties to the French Agreement will execute and deliver the Agreed Form Sale and Purchase Agreement within two business days following the satisfaction of the employee consultation process requirements.  
 The French Agreement contains representations, warranties, and covenants that we believe are customary for a transaction of this size and type, as well as indemnification provisions subject to specified limitations. The closing of the transaction is subject to several customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, as well as the aforementioned consultation process with the Stromag works councils, and is expected to take place during the first quarter of 2017. No assurances can be given that the Stromag Acquisition will be timely consummated or consummated at all. 
 The foregoing summary of the French Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual French Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement  
  On October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  First Amendment ) by and among the Company and Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V. ( Altra B.V. ), one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the  Borrowers ), the Subsidiary Guarantors to the First Amendment, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, KeyBank National Association, as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, and certain lender parties to the First Amendment (collectively, the  Lenders ).   
 The First Amendment would amend the Company s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2015 (the  Credit Agreement ). However, the amendments to the Credit Agreement contained in the First Amendment will not be effective and will not amend the Credit Agreement unless and until certain conditions precedent have been met, including that the Company has provided the Administrative Agent with written notice that the conditions precedent to the closing of the Stromag Acquisition have been satisfied. In the event that the Stromag Acquisition does not occur, or if the other conditions precedent are not satisfied or waived, then the First Amendment shall not become effective.  
 37 

If it becomes effective, the First Amendment, would increase the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement by $75,000,000 (the  Revolver Increase ), so that after giving effect to the Revolver Increase, the   aggregate revolving commitments would total $425,000,000. The First Amendment would also reset the possible expansion of additional future loan commitments   to $150,000,0  00.  In addition, the First Amendment would increase the multicurrency sublimit to $25  0 million and adjust certain financial covenants. The Company expects to use the increased facility to finance the Stromag Acquisition. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the First Amendment, all of the respective terms, conditions and provisions of   the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents remain the same.  
 The foregoing summary of the First Amendment and the transactions contemplated thereby is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual First Amendment, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
