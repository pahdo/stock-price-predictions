General  

Readers of this quarterly
report should refer to the Partnership's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which are included
in the Partnership's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K (File No. 0-13545) filed on March 16, 2016, as certain footnote disclosures
which would substantially duplicate those contained in such audited financial statements have been omitted from this report. Capitalized
terms used but not defined in this quarterly report have the same meanings as in the Partnership's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

JMB/245 Park Avenue
Associates, Ltd. (the  Partnership ), through JMB 245 Park Avenue Holding Company, LLC ( 245 Park Holding ),
owned an approximate .5% general partner interest in Brookfield Financial Properties, L.P. ( BFP, LP ), formerly known
as World Financial Properties, L.P. until December 29, 2014. The ownership was represented by 567.375 Class A Units. Business
activities consisted primarily of rentals to a variety of commercial companies and the ultimate sale or disposition of such real
estate. 245 Park Holding is a limited liability company in which the Partnership is a 99% member and BFP Property GP Corp. ( BFP
GP ), which is an affiliate of the managing general partner of BFP, LP, is a 1% member. 

On December 29, 2014,
BFP, LP transferred 48.5% of the membership interests in BFP 245 Park Co., LLC, which owns an indirect interest in the property
commonly known as 245 Park Avenue, New York, NY, to BFP-JMB 245 Park, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ( BFP/JMB ).
Immediately following such transfer, 245 Park s Holdings  interest in BFP, LP, as represented by the Class A Units
in BFP, LP, was redeemed in exchange for an interest in BFP/JMB represented by Class J shares of BFP/JMB. 245 Park Holding no longer
holds any interest in BFP, LP, and its primary asset now consists of its interest in BFP/JMB. 

Upon execution of
the limited partnership agreement of BFP/JMB, BFP, LP made a distribution to 245 Park Holding of approximately $2.53 million, which
in turn distributed $2.5 million to the Partnership and $0.3 million to BFP, GP. BFP, LP owns all of the common shares and 245
Park Holding owns all of the Class J shares of BFP/JMB. 245 Park Holding has been deemed to have made a capital contribution and
investment for the Class J shares of approximately $7.5 million. The Class J shares will accrue a cumulative annual preferred return
of 5% which has a preference on any distributions by BFP/JMB to BFP, LP not attributable to a capital event. The unpaid preferred
return and unpaid investment attributable to the Class J shares have a preference on any distributions by BFP/JMB to BFP, LP attributable
to a capital event. 

6   

       Table of Contents   

BFP, LP can cause
BFP/JMB to redeem all or any portion of the Class J shares held by 245 Park Holding at any time for a payment equal to any cumulative
unpaid preferred return plus the proportionate remaining unpaid investment attributable to the Class J shares, plus, during the
initial five years following the transaction, an additional payment as follows: (i) with respect to a redemption following December
29, 2015 and prior to December 29, 2016, $5,252,523, (ii) with respect to a redemption on or following December 29, 2016 and prior
to December 29, 2017, $3,939,394, (iii) with respect to a redemption on or following December 29, 2017 and prior to December 29,
2018, $2,626,263, (iv) with respect to a redemption on or following December 29, 2018 and prior to December 29, 2019, $1,313,131
and (v) with respect to a redemption on or following December 29, 2019, $0. At any time thereafter, 245 Park Holding can cause
BFP/JMB to redeem all or any portion of the Class J shares at any time for a payment equal to any cumulative unpaid preferred return
plus the proportionate remaining unpaid investment attributable to the Class J shares. 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and its majority-owned limited liability company, 245 Park Holding.
The effect of all transactions between the Partnership and its consolidated venture has been eliminated. 

The Partnership discontinued
the application of the equity method of accounting, recorded its investment at zero, and no longer recognizes its share of earnings
or losses from BFP, LP or BFP/JMB, because the Partnership has no future funding obligations to BFP, LP or BFP/JMB, and has no
influence or control over the day-to-day affairs of BFP, LP or BFP/JMB. 

The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
or disclosed amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The Partnership's
future liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon JMB for continued advances and the receipt of the
cumulative annual preferred return on the Class J shares of BFP/JMB. JMB's advances, as well as consolidated balances from prior
notes, are evidenced by a demand note (the  Demand Note ), dated December 1, 2004, which Demand Note is secured by the
Partnership's indirect interest in BFP/JMB. JMB is under no obligation to make further advances and has the right to require repayment
of the Demand Note together with accrued and unpaid interest at any time. This uncertainty and the fact that the Partnership has
a net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about the Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments
to these consolidated financial statements for this uncertainty have been made. 

The Financial Accounting
Standards Board recently issued new accounting guidance on when and how an entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting.
Under the new guidance, liquidation basis of accounting should only be used when liquidation is imminent, as defined in the guidance.
Liquidation basis of accounting requires an entity to measure its assets at the estimated amount of cash or other consideration
that it expects to collect and its liabilities at the amount otherwise prescribed under U.S. GAAP. The Partnership has assessed
the new guidance and concluded that the liquidation of the Partnership is not imminent, as defined in the guidance. The Partnership
will continue to monitor whether liquidation is imminent and, thereby, evaluate whether liquidation basis of accounting is required.

In February 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The ASU changes the way reporting entities evaluate whether (a)
they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable
interests in a variable interest entity ( VIE ), and (c) variable interest in a VIE held by related parties of the
reporting entity require the reporting entity to consolidate the VIE. It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on a
majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. This ASU is effective for public
entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 5, 2015. There was no material effect on
the Partnership s financial position or results of operations from the adoption of this ASU. 

In August 2014, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-15. The amendments in this ASU provide guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
disclosures in order to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosure. The amendments in this ASU are effective
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. There was no material
effect on the Partnership s financial position or results of operations from the adoption of this ASU. 

Transactions with Affiliates  

The operations of
the Partnership since 2005 have been primarily funded by cash advances from JMB which totaled $2,117,000 as of September 30,
2016 (of which $10,000 was funded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016) and which, together with the amount owed
and rolled over from prior notes, are evidenced by the Demand Note. The Partnership made payments in the amount of $131,466 to
the accrued interest on the Demand Note during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No additional payments were made
to the accrued interest on the Demand Note and no additional cash advances were made by JMB under the Demand Note through November 9,
2016, the date this report was filed. The Demand Note, which had an outstanding balance of unpaid principal and accrued interest
at September 30, 2016 of $6,937,093 accrues interest at prime plus 1 percent, 4.50% at September 30, 2016, with interest
compounded quarterly and included in principal, and is secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP/JMB. JMB is under no obligation
to make further advances and has the right to require repayment of the Demand Note together with accrued and unpaid interest at
any time. 

In accordance with
the Partnership Agreement, JMB Park Avenue, Inc., the Corporate General Partner, and its affiliates are entitled to receive payment
or reimbursement for salaries and salary-related expenses of its employees, certain of its officers, and other direct expenses
relating to the administration of the Partnership and the operation of the Partnership's real property investments. Additionally,
the Corporate General Partner and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursements for portfolio management, legal and accounting
services. The Partnership incurred costs of $24,727 and $23,410 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, for
these services. The Partnership owed the Corporate General Partner and its affiliates $5,578 and $2,601 for these services at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Any reimbursable amounts
currently payable to the Corporate General Partner and its affiliates do not bear interest.

Adjustments  

In the opinion of
the Corporate General Partner, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation
(assuming the Partnership continues as a going concern) have been made to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Part I.  Financial Information  

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and of Operations  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Capitalized terms
used herein but not defined have the same meanings as in the Partnership's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The Partnership's
future liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern are dependent upon JMB for continued advances and the receipt of the
cumulative annual preferred return on the Class J shares of BFP/JMB. This uncertainty and the fact that the Partnership has a net
capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about the Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern. The operations of the
Partnership since 2005 have been primarily funded by cash advances from JMB which totaled $2,117,000 as of September 30, 2016
(of which $10,000 was funded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016) and which, together with the amount owed and
rolled over from prior notes, are evidenced by the Demand Note. The Partnership made payments in the amount of $131,466 to the
accrued interest on the Demand Note during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No additional payments were made to the
accrued interest on the Demand Note and no additional cash advances were made by JMB under the Demand Note through November 9,
2016, the date that this report was filed. The Demand Note, which had an outstanding balance of unpaid principal and accrued interest
at September 30, 2016 of $6,937,093, accrues interest at prime plus 1 percent, 4.50% at September 30, 2016, with interest
compounded quarterly and included in principal, and is secured by the Partnership's interest in BFP/JMB. JMB is under no obligation
to make further advances and has the right to require repayment of advances previously made together with accrued and unpaid interest
at any time. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Under certain circumstances,
the Partnership may have obligations for Federal or state withholding or estimated tax payments on behalf of certain Holders of
Interests. Notwithstanding any such obligations, the Partnership believes that the Holders of Interests have the ultimate responsibility
for the timely filing of state and Federal tax returns and the payment of all related taxes, including the reimbursement to the
Partnership of all withholding tax payments or estimated tax payments made on their behalf.

       Table of Contents   

The outstanding balance
of the Demand Note at September 30, 2016 is approximately $6,937,000, and continues to accrue interest and be increased in
principal amount by additional advances from JMB. It is unlikely that the Holders of Interests will ever receive any significant
portion of their original investment. However, it is expected that Holders of Interests will be allocated a substantial amount
of gain for Federal and state income tax purposes as a result of transactions which may occur over the remaining term of the Partnership.
These transactions include (i) a sale or other disposition of the 245 Park Avenue property; (ii) a sale or other disposition of
the Partnership's indirect interest in BFP/JMB; or (iii) a reduction in the indebtedness of the 245 Park Avenue property or other
indebtedness of the Partnership for Federal and state income tax purposes. The amount of gain for Federal and state income tax
purposes to be allocated to a Holder of Interests over the remaining term of the Partnership is expected to be, at a minimum, equal
to all or most of the amount of such Holder's deficit capital account for tax purposes. Such gain may be offset by suspended losses
from prior years (if any) that have been allocated to the Holder of Interests. The actual tax liability of each Holder of Interests
will depend on such Holder's own tax situation. 

Results of Operations  

The operations of
the Partnership since 2005 have primarily been funded by cash advances from JMB which totaled $2,117,000 as of September 30,
2016 (of which $10,000 was funded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016) and which, together with the amount owed
and rolled over from Replacement Note 1, are evidenced by the Demand Note at September 30, 2016. 

The increase in demand
note payable to an affiliate at September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 and related increase in interest
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 is due to interest of approximately $231,000 offset by payments of approximately $131,000 made in 2016. 

The increase in professional
services for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 is due to the timing of billings
on accounting services.

CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER  

  PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a)/RULE 15d-14(a)  

   OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED   

I, Patrick J. Meara, certify that: 

1.  
      I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of  JMB/245 Park Avenue Associates, Ltd.  for the period ended September 30, 2016;   

2.  
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;   

4.  
      The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a)  
      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b)

      Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

d)  
      Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)  
      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
