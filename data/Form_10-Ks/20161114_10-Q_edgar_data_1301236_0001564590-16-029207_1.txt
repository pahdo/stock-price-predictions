combined reports enhance investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management;     

combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings in time, effort and expense; and     

combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for their review.

1. Organization and Description of Business 
 Sotherly Hotels Inc., formerly MHI Hospitality Corporation (the  Company ), is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that was incorporated in Maryland on August 20, 2004 to own full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in primary and secondary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States.  Currently, the Company is focused on the acquisition, renovation, upbranding and repositioning of upscale to upper-upscale full-service hotels in the southern United States.  The Company s portfolio consists of investments in twelve hotel properties, comprising 3,011 rooms.  All of the Company s hotels, except for The Georgian Terrace and The Whitehall, operate under the Hilton, Crowne Plaza, DoubleTree, and Sheraton brands. 
 The Company commenced operations on December 21, 2004 when it completed its initial public offering and thereafter consummated the acquisition of six hotel properties (the  initial properties ). Substantially all of the Company s assets are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, Sotherly Hotels LP, formerly MHI Hospitality, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ).  
 Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the  Partnership Agreement ) of the Operating Partnership, the Company, as general partner, is not entitled to compensation for its services to the Operating Partnership.  The Company s administrative expenses are the obligations of the Operating Partnership.  Additionally, the Company is entitled to reimbursement for any expenditure incurred by it on the Operating Partnership s behalf. 
 For the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot operate hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership, which, at September 30, 2016, was approximately 89.4% owned by the Company, and its subsidiaries, lease the hotels to a subsidiary of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc., MHI Hospitality TRS, LLC, (collectively,  MHI TRS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. MHI TRS then engages an eligible independent hotel management company, MHI Hotels Services, LLC, which does business as Chesapeake Hospitality ( Chesapeake Hospitality ), to operate the hotels under a management contract. MHI TRS is treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. 
 All references in this report to  we ,  us  and  our  refer to the Company, its Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and predecessors, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated. 
 Significant transactions occurring during the current and prior fiscal year include the following: 
 On May 5, 2015, we obtained a $47.0 million mortgage with Bank of America N.A. on The Georgian Terrace in Atlanta, Georgia.  The mortgage bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.42% and provides for level payments of principal and interest on a monthly basis under a 30-year amortization schedule.  The maturity date is June 1, 2025.  The Company used the proceeds of the mortgage to repay the existing first mortgage and to pay closing costs, and will use the balance of the proceeds to partially fund ongoing renovations at The Georgian Terrace and for general corporate purposes. 
 During June 2015, the Company sold 98,682 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million, which it contributed to the Operating Partnership for an equivalent number of units. 
 On July 1, 2015, the Company sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $19.8 million, which it contributed to the Operating Partnership for an equivalent number of units.   
 On July 7, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and other loan documents to secure an $18.5 million mortgage with Bank of the Ozarks collateralized by a first mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront. The $18.5 million mortgage was received in two parts. We received $18.0 million on July 7, 2015 and the remainder of $0.5 million on October 20, 2015.  The $0.5 million was included with the additional earn-out provision of $1.5 million, for a total of $2.0 million additional proceeds, as described below.  The mortgage term is four years maturing July 7, 2019 and may be extended for one additional period of one year, subject to certain criteria. The mortgage bears a floating interest rate of the 30-day LIBOR plus 3.5%, subject to a floor rate of 4.0%.  The mortgage amortizes on a 25-year schedule; and has a prepayment penalty if prepaid during the initial two years. The Company used the proceeds from the mortgage to repay the existing first mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, to pay closing costs, to partially fund ongoing renovations at the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront and for general corporate purposes. 
 12 

On July 17, 2015, the Company sold 435,00  0 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $2.8 million, which it contributed to the Operating Partnership for an equivalent number of units.  
 On July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 75% interest in (i) the entity that owns the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, and (ii) the entity that leases the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.  As a result, the Operating Partnership now has a 100% indirect ownership  interest in the entities that own the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.    
   On September 2, 2015, we closed on the sale of a 0.3 acre parcel of excess land adjacent to our Atlanta, Georgia property for $2.2 million.  The parcel was included in the acquisition of The Georgian Terrace in March 2014.  We used the proceeds of the sale for general corporate purposes. 
 On September 28, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement to secure a $60.0 million mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort with Bank of America, N.A.  The mortgage term is ten years maturing October 1, 2025, subject to certain criteria. The mortgage bears a fixed interest rate of 4.913%.  The mortgage amortizes on a 30-year schedule. The Company used the proceeds from the mortgage to repay the existing first mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort and to pay closing costs, and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 On October 20, 2015, we secured $2.0 million additional proceeds on the mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront as part of an earn-out pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement. 
 On December 31, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the existing mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel which generated additional net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million and received the loan proceeds on January 4, 2016 .  
 On March 21, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the existing lender to extend the maturity of the mortgage on The Whitehall until November 2017. 
 On June 27, 2016, we entered into a promissory note and other loan documents to secure a $35.0 million mortgage on the Hilton Savannah DeSoto with MONY Life Insurance Company.  The mortgage term is ten years maturing July 1, 2026, subject to certain criteria. The mortgage bears a fixed interest rate of 4.25%.  The mortgage amortizes on a 25-year schedule after a 1-year interest-only period. The Company used the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the Hilton Savannah DeSoto and to pay closing costs, and will use the balance of the proceeds to fund ongoing renovations at the hotel and for general corporate purposes. 
 On June 30, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement and other loan documents, including a guaranty of payment by the Operating Partnership, to secure a $19.0 million mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore with Fifth Third Bank.  The mortgage term has an initial term of three years, and may be extended for two additional periods of one year each, subject to certain conditions. The mortgage bears a floating interest rate of the 30-day LIBOR plus 3.75%, subject to a floor rate of 3.75%.  The mortgage amortizes on a 25-year schedule.  The Company used the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore and to pay closing costs, and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 On August 23, 2016, the Company sold 1,610,000 shares of 8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred stock, for net proceeds after all expenses of approximately $37.8 million,  which it contributed to the Operating Partnership for an equivalent number of preferred units.

Investment in Hotel Properties     Investments in hotel properties include investments in operating properties which are recorded at acquisition cost and allocated to land, property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Replacements and improv  ements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or retirement of a fixed asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the stat  ements of operations. Expenditures under a renovation project which constitute additions or improvements that extend the life of the property are capitalized.  
 Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 7 to 39 years for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets. 
 We review our investments in hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause a review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized. 
 At December 31, 2015, our review of possible impairment at one of our hotel properties revealed an excess of current carrying cost over the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, which was triggered by a combination of a change in anticipated use and future branding of the property and a re-evaluation of future revenues based on anticipated market conditions, market penetration and costs necessary to achieve such market penetration, resulting in an impairment of approximately $0.5 million. 
 Assets Held For Sale    We record assets as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets, actively seeks a buyer for the assets, and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year.  
 Cash and Cash Equivalents    We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
 Concentration of Credit Risk    We hold cash accounts at several institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ) protection limits of $250,000. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of the failure of these institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC protection limit and the total amounts on deposit. Management monitors, on a regular basis, the financial condition of the financial institutions along with the balances there on deposit to minimize our potential risk.  
 Restricted Cash    Restricted cash includes real estate tax escrows, insurance escrows and reserves for replacements of furniture, fixtures and equipment pursuant to certain requirements in our various mortgage agreements.  
 Accounts Receivable    Accounts receivable consists primarily of hotel guest and banqueting receivables. Ongoing evaluations of collectability are performed and an allowance for potential credit losses is provided against the portion of accounts receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible.    
 Inventories    Inventories, consisting primarily of food and beverages, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a method that approximates first-in, first-out basis.  
 Franchise License Fees    Fees expended to obtain or renew a franchise license are amortized over the life of the license or renewal. The unamortized franchise fees as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $399,694 and $339,542, respectively. Amortization expense for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $15,331 and $40,572, respectively, and for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $45,593 and $68,972, respectively.  
 Deferred Financing and Offering Costs    Deferred financing costs are recorded at cost and consist of loan fees and other costs incurred in issuing debt and are reflected in mortgage loans, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred offering costs are recorded at cost and consist of offering fees and other costs incurred in issuing equity and are reflected in prepaid expenses, inventory and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of deferred financing costs is computed using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.   
   Amortization of deferred offering costs occurs when the common equity offering is complete, whereby the costs are offset against the equity funds raised in the future and included in additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets, or if the  
 14 

offering expires and the offering costs   exceed the funds raised in the offering then the excess will be included in corporate general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  
 Derivative Instruments    Our derivative instruments are reflected as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as an interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value each period is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders  equity and partners  capital to the extent the hedge is effective. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the change in fair value each period is reported in earnings along with the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value each period is reported in earnings.  
 We use derivative instruments to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest-rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we primarily are using an interest rate cap which acts as a cash flow hedge.  We value our interest-rate cap at fair value, which we define as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We also have used derivative instruments in the Company s stock to obtain more favorable terms on our financing. We do not enter into contracts to purchase or sell derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
 Fair Value Measurements   
 We classify the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: 

Level 1   
 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2   
 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.    

Level 3   
 
 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.    

 We endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table represents our investment in hotel property, net, interest rate cap, mortgage loans and unsecured notes measured at fair value and the basis for that measurement: 

(1)   
 
 A non-recurring fair value measurement was conducted in 2015 for our investment in hotel property, which resulted in impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represent the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeded its fair value.    

(2)   
 
 Mortgage loans are reflected at outstanding principal balance net of deferred financing costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    

(3)   
 
 Unsecured notes are recorded at outstanding principal balance net of deferred financing costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    

(4)   
 
 Interest rate cap for our loan on DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, which caps the 1-month LIBOR rate at 2.5%.    

 15 

Noncontrolling Interest in Operating Partnership     Certain hotel properties have been acquired, in part, by the Operating Partnership through the issuance of limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The noncontrolling interest in the Operati  ng Partnership is: (i) increased or decreased by the limited partners  pro-rata share of the Operating Partnership s net income or net loss, respectively; (ii) decreased by distributions; (iii) decreased by redemption of partnership units for the Company s   common stock; and (iv) adjusted to equal the net equity of the Operating Partnership multiplied by the limited partners  ownership percentage immediately after each issuance of units of the Operating Partnership and/or the Company s common stock through a  n adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Net income or net loss is allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership based on the weighted average percentage ownership throughout the period.  
 Revenue Recognition    Revenues from operations of the hotels are recognized when the services are provided. Revenues consist of room sales, food and beverage sales, and other hotel department revenues, such as telephone, parking, gift shop sales and rentals from restaurant tenants, rooftop leases and gift shop operators. Revenues are reported net of occupancy and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.   
 Lease Revenue    Several of our properties generate revenue from leasing commercial space adjacent to the hotel, the restaurant space within the hotel, apartment units and space on the roofs of our hotels for antennas and satellite dishes.  We account for the lease income as revenue from other operating departments within the statement of operations pursuant to the terms of each lease.  Lease revenue was approximately $0.4 million and $0.5 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $1.3 million and $1.4 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
 A schedule of minimum future lease payments receivable for the remaining lease periods is as follows: 

Income Taxes    The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax. MHI TRS, our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary which leases our hotels from subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, is subject to federal and state income taxes.  
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2016, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject generally include 2010 through 2015. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which MHI TRS is subject generally include 2004 through 2015. 
 The Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as the unit holders of the Partnership are subject to tax on their respective shares of the Partnership s taxable income. 
 Stock-based Compensation    The Company s 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan ) and its 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2013 Plan ), which the Company s stockholders approved in April 2013, permit the grant of stock options, restricted stock and performance share compensation awards to its employees for up to 350,000 and 750,000 shares of common stock, respectively. The Company believes that such awards better align the interests of its employees with those of its stockholders.  
 Under the 2004 Plan, the Company has made restricted stock and deferred stock awards totaling 337,438 shares including 255,938 shares issued to certain executives and employees and 81,500 restricted shares issued to its independent directors. Of the 255,938 shares issued to certain of our executives and employees, all have vested except 12,000 shares issued to the Chief Financial Officer upon execution of his employment contract which will vest pro rata on each of the next two anniversaries of the effective date of his employment agreement. All of the 81,500 restricted shares issued to the Company s independent directors have vested. The 2004 Plan was terminated in 2013. 
 16 

Under the 2013 Plan, the Company has made stock awards totaling 109,100 shares, including 72,350 non-restricted shares to certain executives and employees and 35,500 restricted shares issued to its indepen  dent directors.  All awards have vested except for 12,000 shares issued to the Company s independent directors in January 2016, which will vest on December 31, 2016.    
 Previously, under the 2004 Plan, and currently, under the 2013 Plan, the Company may issue a variety of performance-based stock awards, including nonqualified stock options. The value of the awards is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting or service period based on the value of the award as determined by the Company s stock price on the date of grant or issuance.  As of September 30, 2016, no performance-based stock awards have been granted. Consequently, stock-based compensation as determined under the fair-value method would be the same under the intrinsic-value method. Total compensation cost recognized under the 2004 and 2013 Plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $206,703 and $276,016, respectively.   
 Advertising    Advertising costs were $138,017 and $69,006 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $333,076 and $178,661 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  
 Comprehensive Income    Comprehensive income as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. We do not have any items of comprehensive income other than net income.  
 Segment Information    We have determined that our business is conducted in one reportable segment: hotel ownership.  
 Use of Estimates    The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 Reclassifications    Certain reclassifications in the amount of $4.1 million, from deferred financing costs, net in total assets on the consolidating balance sheet, have been netted against mortgage loans and unsecured debt on the December 31, 2015 balances to conform to the current period presentation.  This presentation applies Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,       Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  Loss on early debt extinguishments in the amount of $698,083 has been reclassified from amortization of deferred financing costs on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of September 30, 2015 to conform to the current period presentation.   
 New Accounting Pronouncements    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) .  Current GAAP either is unclear or does not include specific guidance on the eight cash flow classification issues included in the amendments in this update. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application of this ASU is permitted for all entities. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on the statements of cash flows.  
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . The amendments in this ASU provide clarification to certain core recognition principles related to ASU No. 2014-09 including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and disclosures no longer required if the full retrospective transition method is adopted.  The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance.  We will adopt this ASU as of our quarter ending March 31, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our financial statements. 
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . This update clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation contained in ASU No. 2014-09. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance.  We will adopt this ASU as of our quarter ending March 31, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our financial statements. 
   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The FASB issued this ASU to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018.  
 17 

Early application   of this ASU is permitted for all entities.   We are   currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on the balance sheets and statements of operations.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 related to     Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ,  as part of its simplification initiative. The ASU changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under the ASU, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense.  The ASU specifies that  issue costs shall be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the note  and that  amortization of debt issue costs shall also be reported as interest expense.  According to the ASU s Basis for Conclusions, debt issuance costs incurred before the associated funding is received (i.e., the debt liability) should be reported on the balance sheet as deferred charges until that debt liability amount is recorded.  For public business entities, the guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and is applicable for our interim periods within 2016. Early adoption is allowed for all entities for financial statements that have not been previously issued. Entities would apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods (i.e., the balance sheet for each period is adjusted).  We adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016 and applied its provisions retrospectively.  The adoption of this standard only affects the presentation of the consolidated balance sheets. 
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 related to ASC Topic 810,  Consolidation . The amendments in this update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments: 1. Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities; 2. Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; 3. Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; 4. Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.  This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  We have assessed the impact of adopting this ASU as insignificant on the balance sheets and statements of operations.

Employment Agreements  - The Company has entered into various employment contracts with employees that could result in obligations to the Company in the event of a change in control or termination without cause.  
 Management Agreements    At September 30, 2016, each of our wholly-owned operating hotels was operated under a management agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality.  Effective January 1, 2015, each of our wholly-owned hotels operated under a new master agreement as well as an individual hotel management agreement (see Note 7).  Each of the individual hotel management agreements may be terminated earlier than the stated term upon the sale of the hotel covered by the respective management agreement, in which case we may incur early termination fees.  
 Franchise Agreements    As of September 30, 2016, most of our hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel companies. Under the franchise agreements, we are required to pay a franchise fee generally between 2.5% and 5.0% of room revenues, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems, and other franchisor programs and services that amount to between 2.5% and 6.0% of room revenues from the hotels. The franchise agreements expire between July 2017 and September 2025.    Each of our franchise agreements provides for early termination fees in the event the agreement is terminated before the stated term.  
 Restricted Cash Reserves    Each month, we are required to escrow with the lenders on the Hilton Wilmington Riverside, the Hilton Savannah DeSoto, the DoubleTree by Hilton Brownstone-University, the Sheraton Louisville Riverside and The Georgian Terrace an amount equal to 1/12th of the annual real estate taxes due for the properties. We are also required by several of our lenders to establish individual property improvement funds to cover the cost of replacing capital assets at our properties. Each month, those contributions equal 4.0% of gross revenues for the Hilton Savannah DeSoto, the Hilton Wilmington Riverside, the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University, The Whitehall, Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina and The Georgian Terrace and equal 4.0% of room revenues for the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport.  
 Litigation   To our knowledge, we are not involved in any material litigation threatened against us. We are involved in routine litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business, all of which we expect to be covered by insurance and we believe it is not reasonably possible such matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows.

The number of shares issuable upon exercise of the redemption rights will be adjusted upon the occurrence of stock splits, mergers, consolidations or similar pro-rata share transactions, which otherwise would have the effect of diluting the ownership interests of the limited partners or the stockholders of the Company.  
 There were no issuances or redemptions, since January 1, 2015, of units in the Operating Partnership other than the issuances of units in the Operating Partnership to the Company described above.

9. Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we own 100% of the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort and it is consolidated within the financial statements presented.  However, through July 30, 2015 we owned only a 25.0% indirect interest in (i) the entity that owns the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort and (ii) the entity that leases the hotel and has engaged Chesapeake Hospitality to operate the hotel under a management contract. Affiliates of both Carlyle Realty Partners V, L.P. and The Carlyle Group ( Carlyle ) owned a 75.0% indirect controlling interest in these entities through July 30, 2015. The joint venture purchased the property on August 8, 2007 and began operations on September 18, 2007.

11. Income Taxes 
 The components of the income tax (benefit)/provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax (benefit)/provision to the Company s income tax (benefit)/provision is as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately $5.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of which, approximately $4.9 million and $4.5 million, respectively, are due to accumulated net operating losses. These loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 if not utilized by such time.  As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $0.2 million of the net deferred tax asset is attributable to our share of start-up expenses related to the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, start-up expenses related to the opening of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside and the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore that were not deductible in the year incurred, but are being amortized over 15 years.  The remainder of the net  
 25 

deferred tax asset is attributable to year-to-year timing differences including accrued, but not deductible, employee performance awards, vacation an  d sick pay, bad debt allowance and depreciation.  We believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized and that no valuation allowance is required.  
 12. Income Per Share and Per Unit 
 Income per Share . The limited partners  outstanding limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership (which may be redeemed for common stock upon notice from the limited partners and following our election to redeem the units for stock rather than cash) have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as there would be no effect on the amounts since the limited partners  share of income would also be added back to net income. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is presented below.

            Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Fina  ncial Condition and Results of Operations     

 Overview 
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 to pursue opportunities in the full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale segments of the hotel industry located in primary and secondary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States.  Substantially all of the assets of Sotherly Hotels Inc. are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, Sotherly Hotels LP, formerly MHI Hospitality, L.P. We commenced operations in December 2004 when we completed our initial public offering and thereafter consummated the acquisition of the initial properties. 
 Our hotel portfolio currently consists of twelve full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels, comprising 3,011 rooms. All of our properties, except for The Georgian Terrace and The Whitehall, operate under well-known brands such as Hilton, Crowne Plaza, DoubleTree and Sheraton.   As of September 30, 2016, we owned the following hotel properties: 

(1)   
 
 In October 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina, which is subject to customary closing conditions.  The previously disclosed purchase and sale agreement relating to this property, with a separate prospective buyer, terminated in accordance with its terms upon that prospective buyers failure to perform under the agreement.    

(2)   
 
 We believe that The Georgian Terrace and The Whitehall would each carry a chain scale designation of upper upscale if they were branded hotels.    

 We conduct substantially all our business through our Operating Partnership.  We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, and we own an approximate 89.4% interest in our Operating Partnership, as of the date of this filing, with the remaining interest being held by limited partners who were the contributors of our initial properties and related assets. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we cannot operate hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned hotel properties are leased to our TRS Lessees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.  Our TRS Lessees then engage an eligible independent hotel management company to operate the hotels under a management agreement.  Our TRS Lessee has engaged Chesapeake Hospitality to manage our wholly-owned hotels.  Our TRS Lessees, and their parent, MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc., are consolidated into our financial statements for accounting purposes.  The earnings of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. are subject to taxation similar to other C corporations. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 In the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories such as food, beverage, catering, parking, and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to measure room revenues: 

Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available;     

Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and     

Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms.     

 28 

RevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability tha  n changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees, cr  edit card commissions and reservation expenses), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel s restaurant, banquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact o  n operating margins and profitability as they do not generate all of the additional variable operating costs associated with higher occupancy.  
 We also use FFO, Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance.  See  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

Results of Operations 
 The following tables illustrate the key operating metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the Company s wholly-owned properties, during each respective reporting period ( actual  portfolio metrics), as well as the eleven wholly-owned properties in the portfolio that were under the Company s control during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the corresponding period in 2015 ( same-store  portfolio metrics). Accordingly, the same-store data does not reflect the performance for the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, which was acquired through a joint venture in August 2007 and in which the Company had a 25.0% indirect interest prior to its acquisition of the remaining 75.0% interest in July 2015. 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Revenue .  Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $3.3 million, or 9.8%, to approximately $37.3 million compared to total revenue of approximately $33.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Approximately $1.5 million of the increase relates to the acquisition of our property in Hollywood Beach, Florida in July 2015.  Increases in revenues at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina;   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;   Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida; and Hampton, Virginia, were offset by decreases in revenue impacted by the change in the performance resulting from our renovation activities at Savannah, Georgia, and the downturn in the oil market in Houston, Texas, as well as, other revenue decreases at properties in Raleigh, North Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia.  
 Room revenue increased approximately $2.5 million, or 10.5%, to approximately $26.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to room revenue of approximately $24.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

 Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $0.4 million, or 12.3%, to $3.8 million compared to depreciation and amortization of approximately $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

 Indirect expenses at our wholly-owned properties were approximately $43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $6.2 million, or 16.7%, compared to indirect expenses of approximately $37.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in indirect expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was substantially related to the acquired property in Hollywood Beach, Florida, accounting for an increase in indirect expenses of approximately $5.1 million for the period, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015, along with increased property taxes at our properties in Savannah, Georgia and Atlanta, Georgia by approximately $0.4 million and increased sales and marketing expenses by approximately $0.9 million at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;   Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. 
 Depreciation and Amortization .  Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $1.7 million, or 17.5%, to $11.3 million compared to depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mostly attributable to increases in the depreciation related to our acquired property in Hollywood Beach, Florida, accounting for increases of approximately $1.3 million for the period.  
 32 

Corporate General and Administrative.    Corporate general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately $1.0 million, or 19.5%, to approximately $4.3 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately $5.4 milli  on, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to one-time corporate general and administrative expenses during the nine month period ending September 30, 2015 including acqui  sition costs of approximately $0.6 million and a one-time tax penalty of $0.4 million, as well as, additional staffing and related salary increases of approximately $0.2 million, and decreased professional fees of approximately $0.1 million.  
 Interest Expense .  Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $2.0 million, or 17.0%, to approximately $13.9 million compared to interest expense of approximately $11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was substantially related to the assumed mortgage loan for the acquired property in Hollywood Beach, Florida, accounting for an increase in interest expense of approximately $1.6 million for the period, as compared to the same period in 2015.  
 Equity Income in Joint Venture .  Equity income in joint venture for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 represented our 25.0% share of the net income of the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we realized approximately $0 and $0.5 million net income, respectively.    
 Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we refinanced a fixed rate mortgage loan, we had with the C-1 Bank on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore, with a new fixed rate loan from Fifth Third Bank.  The amount of accumulated un-amortized loan costs of $40,236 was written off during the period ending September 30, 2016.  We also refinanced a fixed rate mortgage loan we had with the MONY Life Insurance Co. on the Hilton Savannah Desoto, writing off loan costs of $30,057. Lastly we redeemed the entire $27.6 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8% Notes, with accumulated un-amortized loan costs in the amount of $811,395 written off and $276,000 in early termination costs paid during the period ending September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we refinanced a variable rate mortgage loan, we had with the Bank of the Ozarks on The Georgian Terrace, with a new fixed rate loan from Bank of America.  In addition, we refinanced a variable rate mortgage loan, we had with Fifth Third Bank on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, with a new variable rate loan from Bank of the Ozarks.  Accumulated un-amortized loan costs in the amount of $75,324 were written off during the period ending September 30, 2015.    
 Loss on Disposal of Assets.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $329,461, compared to 201,835 loss on disposal of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Unrealized Loss on Hedging Activities.   As of September 30, 2016, the fair market value of the interest rate cap, on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront mortgage, is $4,414.  The unrealized loss on hedging activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $66,567 and $106,808, respectively.  
 Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Asset.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a gain on involuntary conversion of asset in the amount of $32,433, compared to no gain on involuntary conversion of asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Gain on Change in Control.   On July 31, 2015, we acquired from Carlyle the remaining 75% of the entities that own and lease the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.  Due to the increased fair market value of the property for our original 25% we recognized a discounted gain on change in control.  The gain on change in control during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $0 and $6.6 million, respectively.    
 Income Taxes.   We had an income tax benefit of approximately $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax provision of approximately $3,255 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The income tax benefit is primarily derived from the operations of our TRS Lessee.  Our TRS Lessee realized a taxable operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company .  We realized net income attributable to the Company of approximately $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net income attributable to the Company of approximately $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of the operating results discussed above.   
 Distributions to Preferred Shareholders .  During the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 we sold 1,610,000 shares of preferred stock which have quarterly dividends payable to those preferred shareholders at a rate of 8% annually.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we accrued $339,889 and $0 as dividends on the preferred stock, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 We consider FFO, Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to be key supplemental measures of our performance and could be considered along with, not alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.  These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) or amounts available for our discretionary use and should not be considered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. 
 FFO and Adjusted FFO.   Industry analysts and investors use FFO as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT.  FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ).  FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by itself.  
 We consider FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of performance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies may not calculate FFO in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO as reported by us is comparable to FFO as reported by other REITs. 
 We further adjust FFO for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT s definition of FFO, including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on its hedging instruments or warrant derivative, loan impairment losses, losses on early extinguishment of debt, aborted offering costs, franchise termination costs, loan modification fees, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, litigation settlement, over-assessed real estate taxes on appeal, change in control gains or losses and acquisition transaction costs. 
 We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful comparisons between periods and among other REITs and is more indicative of the on-going performance of our business and assets.  Our calculation of Adjusted FFO may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs. 
 34 

The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and Adjusted FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Hotel EBITDA .  We define Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income tax provision or benefit, (4) equity in the income or loss of equity investees, (5) unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not included in other comprehensive income, (6) gains and losses on disposal of assets, (7) realized gains and losses on investments, (8) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (9) loss on early debt extinguishment, (10) gains or losses on change in control, (11) corporate general and administrative expense, (12) depreciation and amortization, (13) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets and (14) other operating revenue not related to our wholly-owned portfolio.  We believe this provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control.  We believe Hotel EBITDA provides investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.  
 Our calculation of Hotel EBITDA may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to Hotel EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Operating Activities.  Our principal source of cash to meet our operating requirements, including distributions to unitholders and stockholders as well as debt service (excluding debt maturities), is the operations of our hotels.  Cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $15.3 million.  We had an increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $6.0 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is mainly attributable to a net increase in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $3.0 million and a net increase of changes in assets and liabilities of approximately $3.0 million.  We expect that cash on hand and the net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund our continuing operations, monthly and quarterly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of a debt) and the payment of common and preferred dividends (distributions) to the Company s stockholders (and unitholders of the Operating Partnership) in accordance with federal income tax laws which require us to make annual distributions, as  qualifying distributions,  to the Company s stockholders of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding its net capital gains, and reduced by certain non-cash items).  
 Investing Activities.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used approximately $11.2 million on capital expenditures, of which, approximately $4.2 million related to the routine replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and $7.0 million related to renovation of our properties in Laurel, Maryland; Atlanta, Georgia; Houston, Texas and Savannah, Georgia.  We also contributed approximately $4.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 into reserves required by the lenders for ten of our hotels according to the provisions of their respective loan agreements.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received reimbursements from those reserves of approximately $6.3 million for capital expenditures related to those properties and proceeds from the sale of assets of $0.2 million.   
   Financing Activities . Cash flow provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $8.3 million.  This inflow was comprised of net proceeds (after all expenses) from our preferred stock offering of approximately $37.8 million, offset by net proceeds on mortgage loans of approximately $3.8 million,  redemption of the 8%   
 36 

unse  cured loans of $27.6   million, dividend and distribution payments of approximately $4.3 million and payments of deferred financing costs of approximately $  1.5   million.  
 Capital Expenditures 
 We anticipate that our need for recurring capital expenditures for the replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment over the next 12 to 24 months will be at historical norms for our properties and the industry.  Historically, we have aimed to maintain overall capital expenditures, except for those required by our franchisors as a condition to a franchise license or license renewal, at 4.0% of gross revenue.  Below is a description of capital expenditures by property: 

At the Company s hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, an estimated $7.0 million guestroom renovation is complete.         

At the Company s hotel in Savannah, Georgia, renovations of the guestrooms and public spaces totaling an estimated $8.2 million are underway.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred costs totaling approximately $3.9 million toward this renovation.  Renovations are expected to be completed in August 2017.       

 Given our desire to continue renovations in Savannah, Georgia, we aim to restrict all other capital expenditures at this hotel during the renovation period to the replacement of broken or damaged furniture and equipment and the acquisition of items mandated by our licensor that are necessary to maintain our brand affiliation.  We anticipate that capital expenditures for the replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment that are not related to these renovation activities to total 2.50% to 3.00% of gross revenues in 2016. 
 We expect a substantial portion of our capital expenditures for the recurring replacement or refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment at our properties will be funded by our replacement reserve accounts, other than costs that we incur to make capital improvements required by our franchisors.  Reserve accounts are escrowed accounts with funds deposited monthly and reserved for capital improvements or expenditures with respect to all of our hotels.  We currently deposit an amount equal to 4.0% of gross revenue for the Hilton Savannah DeSoto, the Hilton Wilmington Riverside, the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina, the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University, the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, The Whitehall, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort and The Georgian Terrace as well as 4.0% of room revenues for the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport on a monthly basis. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had total cash of approximately $32.3 million, of which approximately $26.4 million was in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.9 million was restricted for real estate taxes, insurance, capital improvement and certain other expenses, or otherwise restricted.  We expect that our cash on hand combined with our cash flow from the operations of our hotels should be adequate to fund continuing operations, recurring capital expenditures for the refurbishment and replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and monthly and quarterly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of the indentures or mortgage debt). 
 On June 27, 2016, we entered into a promissory note and other loan documents to secure a $35.0 million mortgage on the Hilton Savannah DeSoto with MONY Life Insurance Company.  The loan has a maturity date of July 1, 2026. 
 On June 30, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement and other loan documents, including a guaranty of payment by the Operating Partnership, to secure a $19.0 million mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore with Fifth Third Bank.  The loan has an initial term of three years with a maturity on July 1, 2019, and may be extended for two additional periods of one year each, subject to certain conditions. 
 On August 23, 2016, the Company issued 1,610,000 shares, $0.01 par value per share, of its 8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock for net proceeds after all expenses of approximately $37.8 million, which it contributed to the Operating Partnership for an equivalent number of preferred units. 
 On September 30, 2016, the Operating Partnership redeemed the entire $27.6 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8% Notes. 
 On October 6, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina, which is subject to customary closing conditions. 
 37 

On October 12, 2016,   we   entered into a loan agreement to sec  ure a $20.5 million mortgage on The Whitehall with International Bank of Commerce.  Pursuant to the loan documents, the loan: provides initial proceeds of $15.0 million, with an additional $5.5 million available upon the satisfaction of certain conditions,   has a term of five years, bears a floating interest rate of the 30-day LIBOR plus 3.5%, subject to a floor rate of 4.0%, amortizes on an 18-year schedule after a 2-year interest only period, is subject to prepayment fees, and is guaranteed by Sotherly Hot  els LP.  
 On November 3, 2016,   we entered into a loan agreement to refinance the mortgage on the Sheraton Louisville Riverside with Symetra Life Insurance Company.  Pursuant to the loan documents, the loan: provides proceeds of $12.0 million, has a maturity date of December 1, 2026, bears a fixed interest rate of 4.27% for the first 5 years of the loan with an option for the lender to reset that rate after 5 years, amortizes on a 25-year schedule, is subject to prepayment fees, and is guaranteed by Sotherly Hotels LP at 50% of the unpaid principal balance, interest, and other amounts owed. 
 On November 3, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement to modify and extend the $2.6 million mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina with TowneBank.  Pursuant to the amended loan documents, the loan:  continues to bear a fixed interest rate of 5.00%, has a maturity date of November 1, 2019, and beginning on December 1, 2016 requires monthly principal payments of $15,367 plus accrued unpaid interest. 
 On September 14, 2016,  we  entered into an agreement to purchase the commercial unit of the Hyde Resort   Residences, a condominium hotel under development in the Hollywood, Florida market, for a price of $4.25 million from 4111 South Ocean Drive, LLC.  The agreement also includes the Company s purchase of certain inventories consistent with the management and operation of the hotel and the related condominium association for an additional price of approximately $0.47 million.  In connection with the closing under the agreement, the Company intends to enter into a lease agreement for the 400-space parking garage and meeting rooms associated with the hotel, a management agreement relating to the operation and management of the hotel condominium association, and a pre-opening services agreement whereby the seller will pay the Company a fee of $0.75 million in connection with certain pre-opening preparations.  The closing of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions as described in the agreement and is expected to close in January 2017. 
 Prior to August 2018, our only maturity debt obligation is mortgage on the Hilton Wilmington Riverside which matures on April 1, 2017.  We anticipate refinancing the indebtedness prior to the maturity date. 
 We will need to, and plan to, renew, replace or extend our existing indebtedness prior to their respective maturity dates.  We are uncertain whether we will be able to refinance these obligations or if refinancing terms will be favorable.  If we are unable to obtain alternative or additional financing arrangements in the future, or if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms.  To the extent we cannot repay our outstanding debt, we risk losing some or all of these properties to foreclosure and we could be required to invoke insolvency proceedings including, but not limited to, commencing a voluntary case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
 We intend to continue to invest in hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. The success of our acquisition strategy depends, in part, on our ability to access additional capital through other sources. There can be no assurance that we will continue to make investments in properties that meet our investment criteria. Additionally, we may choose to dispose of certain hotels as a means to provide liquidity. 
 We expect to meet our liquidity requirements for hotel property acquisitions, property redevelopment, investments in new joint ventures and debt maturities, which include the repayment of the 7% Notes (which are callable after November 15, 2017) and the retirement of maturing mortgage debt, through net proceeds from additional issuances of common shares, additional issuances of preferred shares, issuances of units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, secured and unsecured borrowings, as well as the selective disposition of non-core assets.  We remain committed to a flexible capital structure and strive to maintain prudent debt leverage. 

Financial Covenants 
 Mortgage Loans 
 Our mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants.  Failure to comply with these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in the local competitive environment, general economic conditions and disruption caused by renovation activity or major weather disturbances. 
   If we violate the financial covenants contained in these agreements, we may attempt to negotiate waivers of the violations or amend the terms of the applicable mortgage loan agreement with the lender; however, we can make no assurance that we would be  
 38 

successful in any such negotiation or that, if successful in obtaining waivers or amendments, such waivers or amendments would be on attractive terms.  Some   mortgage loan agreements provide alternate cure provisions which may allow us to otherwise comply with the financial covenants by obtaining an appraisal of the hotel, prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or by providing cash collateral unti  l such time as the financial covenants are met by the collateralized property without consideration of the cash collateral.  Alternate cure provisions which include prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or providing cash collateral may have a   material impact on our liquidity.  
 If we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment or satisfy alternate cure provisions, if any, or unable to meet any alternate cure requirements and a default were to occur, we would possibly have to refinance the debt through additional debt financing, private or public offerings of debt securities, or additional equity financing. 
 Under the terms of our non-recourse secured mortgage loan agreements, failure to comply with the financial covenants in the loan agreement triggers cash flows from the property to be directed to the lender, which may limit our overall liquidity as that cash flow would not be available to us. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, current on all loan payments and not otherwise in default under any of our mortgage loans.  With regard to the mortgage loan on The Whitehall, we made a principal payment in the amount of approximately $6.4 million during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, to bring the loan in compliance with its Debt Service Coverage Ratio covenant.  The mortgage loan was then refinanced as described in the  Subsequent Events  section. 
 Unsecured Notes 
 The indenture for the 7% Notes contains certain covenants and restrictions that require us to meet certain financial ratios.  We are not permitted to incur any Debt (other than intercompany Debt), as defined in the indentures, if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and to the application of the proceeds thereof, the ratio of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt to Adjusted Total Asset Value, as defined in the indentures, would be greater than 0.65 to 1.0.  In addition, we are not permitted to incur any Debt if the ratio of Stabilized Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to Stabilized Consolidated Interest Expense, both as defined in the indentures, on the date on which such additional Debt is to be incurred, on a pro-forma basis, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and to the application of the proceeds thereof, would be less than 1.50 to 1.0. 
 39 

These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and are presented below for the sole purpose of evaluating our compliance with the key financial covenants as they were a  pplicable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

(1)   
 
 Represents the four preceding calendar quarters.    

(2)   
 
 As permitted by the indenture, the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport, DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel, DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront and The Whitehall, for the period ended September 30, 2016, and the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport, DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel, DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, and The White Hall, for the period ended December 31, 2015, are considered non-stabilized assets for purposes of the financial covenants.    

 40 

Dividend Policy  
 We intend to continue to declare quarterly distributions to our stockholders.  The amount of future common stock (and Operating Partnership unit) distributions will be based upon quarterly operating results, general economic conditions, requirements for capital improvements, the availability of debt and equity capital, the Internal Revenue Code s annual distribution requirements and other factors, which the Company s board of directors deems relevant.  The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by the Company s board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors, and no assurance can be given that our distribution policy will not change in the future. 
 In January 2016, we increased the quarterly dividend (distribution) to $0.085 per common share (and unit). 
 In April 2016, we increased the quarterly dividend (distribution) to $0.09 per common share (and unit). 
 In July 2016, we increased the quarterly dividend (distribution) to $0.095 per common share (and unit). 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Through a joint venture with a Carlyle subsidiary, until July 30, 2015 we owned a 25.0% indirect, noncontrolling interest in an entity that acquired the 311-room Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort in Hollywood Beach, Florida in 2007.  Pursuant to the joint venture, we had the right to receive a pro rata share of operating surpluses and we had an obligation to fund our pro rata share of operating shortfalls.  We also had the opportunity to earn an incentive participation in the net proceeds realized from the sale of the hotel based upon the achievement of certain overall investment returns, in addition to our pro rata share of net sale proceeds.  The Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort was leased to another entity in which we also owned a 25.0% indirect, noncontrolling interest. 
 Carlyle owned a 75.0% controlling interest in the entities that own and lease the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.  Carlyle had the right to dispose of the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort without our consent.  We accounted for our noncontrolling 25.0% interest in all of these entities under the equity method of accounting. 
 On July 31, 2015, indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership acquired from Carlyle the remaining 75.0% interest in the entities that own and lease the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.  As a result, the Operating Partnership now has a 100% indirect ownership  interest in the entities that own the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort.  The property was refinanced on September 28, 2015 and is encumbered by a $60.0 million mortgage which matures in September 2025 and requires monthly payments of interest at a rate of 4.913%. The Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort secures the mortgage.  
 Inflation 
 We generate revenues primarily from lease payments from our TRS Lessees and net income from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Therefore, we rely primarily on the performance of the individual properties and the ability of the management company to increase revenues and to keep pace with inflation.  Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to keep pace with inflation.  However, competitive pressures at some or all of our hotels may limit the ability of the management company to raise room rates. 
 Our expenses, including hotel operating expenses, administrative expenses, real estate taxes and property and casualty insurance are subject to inflation. These expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation, except for energy, liability insurance, property and casualty insurance, property tax rates, employee benefits, and some wages, which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation. 
 Geographic Concentration and Seasonality 
 Our hotels are located in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.  As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in these geographic areas, including industry downturns, relocation of businesses and any oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand.  Adverse economic developments in the markets in which we have a concentration of hotels, or in any of the other markets in which we operate, or any increase in hotel supply or decrease in lodging demand resulting from the local, regional or national business climate, could materially and adversely affect us. 
 The operations of our hotel properties have historically been seasonal.  The months of April and May are traditionally strong, as is October.  The periods from mid-November through mid-February are traditionally slow with the exception of hotels located in certain markets, namely Florida and Texas, which experience significant room demand during this period. 
 41 

Critical Accounting Policies  
 The critical accounting policies are described below.  We consider these policies critical because they involve difficult management judgments and assumptions, are subject to material change from external factors or are pervasive, and are significant to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results. 
 Investment in Hotel Properties.  Hotel properties are stated at cost, net of any impairment charges, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 7-39 years for buildings and improvements and 3-10 years for furniture and equipment.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the controlling interests in hotels comprising our accounting predecessor, MHI Hotels Services Group, and noncontrolling interests held by the controlling holders of our accounting predecessor in hotels acquired from third parties, which were contributed to us in connection with the Company s initial public offering, are recorded at historical cost basis.  Noncontrolling interests in those entities that comprise our accounting predecessor and the interests in hotels, other than those held by the controlling members of our accounting predecessor, acquired from third parties are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition.  
 We review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable.  Events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located.  When such conditions exist, management performs a recoverability analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities and the estimated proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value.  If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of a hotel property, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss is recognized. 
 There were no charges for impairment of hotel properties recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 In performing the recoverability analysis, we project future operating cash flows based upon significant assumptions regarding growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs and future capital expenditures required to maintain the hotel in its current operating condition.  We also project cash flows from the eventual disposition of the hotel based upon various factors including property-specific capitalization rates, ratio of selling price to gross hotel revenues and the selling price per room. 
 Revenue Recognition.   Hotel revenues, including room, food, beverage and other hotel revenues, are recognized as the related services are delivered. We generally consider accounts receivable to be fully collectible; accordingly, no allowance for doubtful accounts is required. If we determine that amounts are uncollectible, which would generally be the result of a customer s bankruptcy or other economic downturn, such amounts will be charged against operations when that determination is made.  Revenues are reported net of occupancy and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. Receivables for amounts earned under various contracts are subject to audit.  
 Income Taxes.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.  Due to our history of earnings without expiration of loss carryforwards coupled with expected future taxable income of our TRS Lessees, we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2016.  In conjunction with our ongoing analysis, should negative evidence be identified to suggest that the recoverability of our deferred tax assets no longer remains more likely than not, we would record an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset in the period such determination was made.

 Forward Looking Statements 
   Information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and as such may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our current strategies, expectations, and future plans are generally identified by our use of words, such as  intend,   plan,   may,   should,   will,   project,   estimate,   
 42 

anticipate,   believe,   expect,   continue,   potential,   opportunity,  and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative, but the absence of these words does not nece  ssarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.  All statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans are forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future pr  ospects include, but are not limited to:  

national and local economic and business conditions that affect occupancy rates and revenues at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services;     

risks associated with the hotel industry, including competition, increases in wages, energy costs and other operating costs;     

the magnitude and sustainability of the economic recovery in the hospitality industry and in the markets in which we operate;     

the availability and terms of financing and capital and the general volatility of the securities markets;     

risks associated with the level of our indebtedness and our ability to meet covenants in our debt agreements and, if necessary, to refinance or seek an extension of the maturity of such indebtedness or modify such debt agreements;     

management and performance of our hotels;     

risks associated with maintaining our system of internal controls;     

risks associated with the conflicts of interest of the Company s officers and directors;     

risks associated with redevelopment and repositioning projects, including delays and cost overruns;     

supply and demand for hotel rooms in our current and proposed market areas;     

risks associated with our ability to maintain our franchise agreements with our third party franchisors;     

our ability to acquire additional properties and the risk that potential acquisitions may not perform in accordance with expectations;     

our ability to successfully expand into new markets;     

legislative/regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing taxation of REITs;     

the Company s ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT; and     

our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage.     

 Additional factors that could cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements are set forth under the section titled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statement contained in this report or incorporated by reference herein.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section.  We undertake no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report, except as required by law.  In addition, our past results are not necessarily indicative of our future results. 

Item 3.   
 
      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     

 The effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below.  Our market risk discussion includes  forward-looking statements  and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that could occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses.  As a result, actual future results may differ materially from those presented.  The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. 
 To meet in part our long-term liquidity requirements, we will borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates.  Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs.  From time to time we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments.  We do not intend to hold or issue derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 43 

As of   September 30  , 2016  , we had approximately $  231.6   million of fixed-rate debt and approximately $  66.6   million of variable-rate debt.  The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was   5.11  %.  A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the   debt, but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flows.  Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-month LIBOR.  However, to the extent that   1-month   LIBOR does not exceed the   1-month   LIBOR floor on t  he mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport of 0.50%  ,   a portion of our variable-rate debt would not be exposed to changes in interest rates.   Assuming that the aggregate amount outstanding on the mortgage  s   on the DoubleTree by Hilton Phil  adelphia Airport  ,   the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront     and on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore   remain at approximately $  66.6   million, the balance at   September 30  , 2016  , the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent   increase in 1-month LIBOR would be approximately $  0.7   million.  
 As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $272.6 million of fixed-rate debt and approximately $52.3 million of variable-rate debt.  The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was 5.58%.  A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt, but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flows.  Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-month LIBOR.  However, to the extent that 1-month LIBOR does not exceed the 1-month LIBOR floor on the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport of 0.50%, a portion of our variable-rate debt would not be exposed to changes in interest rates.   Assuming that the aggregate amount outstanding on the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront remains at approximately $52.2 million, the balance at December 31, 2015, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent increase in 1-month LIBOR would be approximately $0.5 million. 

Item 4.   
 
      Controls and Procedures     

 Sotherly Hotels Inc.  
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 The Company s management, under the supervision and participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, its disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported with the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and instructions, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Sotherly Hotels Inc. have been detected.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
   There was no change in Sotherly Hotels Inc. s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during Sotherly Hotels Inc. s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sotherly Hotels Inc. s internal control over financial reporting.  
 Sotherly Hotels LP  
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   The Operating Partnership s management, under the supervision and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Sotherly Hotels Inc., as general partner, has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and  
 44 

reported with the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and instructions, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive O  fficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   
 The Operating Partnership s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Sotherly Hotels Inc., as general partner, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Sotherly Hotels LP have been detected.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
   There was no change in Sotherly Hotels LP s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during Sotherly Hotels LP s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sotherly Hotels LP s internal control over financial reporting.

PART   II  

Item 1.   
 
      Legal Proceedings     

 We are not involved in any legal proceedings other than routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. We believe that these routine legal proceedings, in the aggregate, are not material to our financial condition and results of operations. 

Item 1A.   
 
      Risk Factors     

   Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
 Holders of our outstanding preferred shares have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares. 
   
 Our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that are senior to those of our common shares.  As of September 30, 2016, 1,610,000 shares of our 8.0% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.  The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding preferred shares is approximately $40.25 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding preferred shares are approximately $3.22 million.  Holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common shares.  Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common shares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid distributions.  This will reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares.  In addition, holders of these preferred shares have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors whenever dividends on the preferred shares are in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to six or more quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive).  Because our decision to issue securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future preferred offerings.  Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interest. 

I  tem 2.   
 
      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     

 From time to time, the Operating Partnership issues limited partnership units to the Company, as required by the Partnership Agreement, to mirror the capital structure of the Company to reflect additional issuances by the Company and to preserve equitable ownership ratios.
