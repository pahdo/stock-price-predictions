Note 1:  
      Basis of Presentation   

Community
Savings Bancorp, Inc. (the  Registrant ), headquartered in Caldwell, Ohio, was formed to serve as the stock holding
company for Community Savings (the  Company ) following its mutual-to-stock conversion. As of September 30, 2016, the
stock conversion had not been completed, and as of that date, the Registrant had no assets or liabilities, and had not conducted
any business other than that of an organizational nature. Accordingly, financial and other information of the Company is included
in this quarterly report. The Registrant s registration statement on Form S-1, as amended, was declared effective as of November
14, 2016.  The completion of the conversion is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2016, which has been derived from audited financial
statements, and unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, were prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and,
therefore, do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, these
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto of the Company
as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 included in the Registrant s Form S-1. Reference is made to the accounting policies
of the Company described in the Notes to the Financial Statements contained in the Form S-1.   

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited financial statements have been
included to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All interim amounts have not been audited and the results of operations for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the
entire fiscal year. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Material estimates that are particularly susceptible
to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of real estate acquired in connection
with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, and fair values of financial instruments.

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale
securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities
because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due
at a single maturity date are shown separately. 

The Company had no sales of investment securities
during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company had pledged certain of its investment
securities with a carrying value of $3.3 million at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, and $200,000 of interest-earning
demand deposits and $110,000 of interest-earning time deposits at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, to secure public deposits. 

The Company s other investment securities consists
of $915,000 of stock in the FHLB and $25,000 of stock in the Company s data service provider at both September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016.

The following tables show the Company s investments 
gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily
impaired, aggregated by investment class and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss
position at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016: 

Other-than-temporary Impairment 

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the decline
in fair value of the Company s investment securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality.
The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized
cost bases of the investments. Because the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will
not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, the Company does not consider these securities
to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

Note 3:   
       Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses    

Loans at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 include: 

The risk characteristics applicable to each segment
of the loan portfolio are described below: 

Residential Real Estate and Home Equity Lines of
Credit   

Residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of
credit are secured by one-to four-family residences and are comprised of owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied loans. Construction
real estate loans (immaterial for the periods presented) are usually based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed
project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment
of these loans may include permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent
financing is obtained. The Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance
if that ratio is exceeded. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be
impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in
property values or residential properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread
over a large number of borrowers. 

Multi-family Residential Real
Estate  

Multi-family real estate loans generally involve a
greater degree of credit risk than one-to four- family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased
credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers,
the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring
these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family real estate is typically dependent upon the successful
operation of 

Table of Contents   

Community
Savings  

 Notes to Condensed Financial Statements
(unaudited) 

the related real estate property. If the cash flow
from the project is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. 

Commercial Real Estate   

Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily
as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan
principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing
the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected
by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The characteristics of properties securing the Company s
real estate portfolio are diverse, but with geographic location almost entirely in the Company s market area. Management
monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. In general, the Company
avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. 

Consumer Loans   

Consumer loans entail greater credit risk than residential
mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such
as automobiles. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment
for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the
borrower. In particular, amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the
condition of the automobiles and the lack of demand for used automobiles.

Internal Risk Categories   

The Company has adopted a standard loan grading system
for all loans. Loans are selected for a grading review based on certain characteristics, including concentrations of credit, subprime
criteria, and upon delinquency of 90 days or more. Definitions are as follows: 

Pass : Loans categorized as Pass are higher
quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 

Special Mention : The loans identified as special
mention have an obvious flaw or a potential weakness that deserves special management attention, but which has not yet impacted
collectability. These flaws or weaknesses, if left uncorrected, may result in the deterioration of the prospects of repayment or
the deterioration of the Company s credit position. 

Substandard : These are loans with a well-defined
weakness, where the Company has a serious concern about the borrower s ability to make full repayment if the weaknesses are
not corrected. The loan may contain a flaw, which could impact the borrower s ability to repay, or the borrower s continuance
as a  going concern . When collateral values are not sufficient to secure the loan and other weaknesses are present,
the loan may be rated substandard. A loan will also be graded substandard when full repayment is expected, but it must come from
the liquidation of collateral. One-to-four family residential real estate loans and home equity loans that are past due 90 days
or more with loan to value ratios greater than 60 percent are classified as substandard. 

Doubtful : These are loans with major defined
weaknesses, where future charge-off of a part of the credit is highly likely. The primary repayment source is no longer viable
and the viability of the secondary source of repayment is in doubt. The amount of loss is uncertain due to circumstances within
the credit that are not yet fully developed and the loan is rated  Doubtful  until the loss can be accurately estimated. 

Loss : These are near term charge offs. Loans
classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that it is not desirable to continue carrying them as
assets on the Company s financial statements, even though partial recovery may be possible at some future time.

The following tables present the Company s loan
portfolio aging analysis of the recorded investment in loans as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016: 

A loan is considered impaired, in accordance with
the impairment accounting guidance (ASC 310-10-35-16), when based on current information and events, it is probable the Company
will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans
include nonperforming loans, but also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings.

The following table presents the Company s nonaccrual
loans at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The table excludes performing troubled debt restructurings. 

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company
had certain loans that were modified, in previous years, in troubled debt restructurings and impaired. The modification of terms
of such loans included one or a combination of the following: an extension of maturity, a reduction of the stated interest rate
or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. The Company had loans modified, in previous years, in a troubled
debt restructuring totaling $92,000 at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Troubled debt restructured loans had specific
allowances totaling $7,000 at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no commitments
to lend additional funds to borrowers with troubled debt restructured loans. 

No loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings
during either of the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

The Company had no troubled debt restructurings modified
during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 that subsequently defaulted during the three-month periods ended September
30, 2016 or 2015. A troubled debt restructured loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past
due under the loan s modified terms. 

In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing
financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its
debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting
policy.

Note 4: 
     Regulatory Matters  

The Company is subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory,
and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s
financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company
must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s assets, liabilities, and certain
off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s capital amounts and classification
are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Furthermore,
the Company s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in these financial statements. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to
ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total capital,
Tier I capital and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of leverage
capital to adjusted average total assets (as defined). 

Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016, that the Company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

Basel III was effective for the Company on January
1, 2015. Basel III requires the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets, as defined in the regulation. Under the new Basel III rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including
dividends, the Company must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized common equity Tier 1 capital to
risk-weighted assets ratio. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from zero percent to 2.50 percent by 2019. Under
Basel III, the Company elected to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. 

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the most
recent notification categorized the Company as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To
be categorized as well capitalized, the Company must maintain minimum total capital, Tier I capital, common equity Tier 1 capital
and leverage capital ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management
believes have changed the Company s category.

to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used
to measure fair value: 

Level 1  
     Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.  

Level 2  
     Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.   

Level 3  
     Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  

Recurring Measurements

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies
and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the accompanying balance sheets, as well
as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. There were no assets classified within Level
3 of the fair value hierarchy measured on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Available-for-sale Securities 

Where quoted market prices are available in an active
market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values
are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing
models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to yield curves,
interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flow. Such securities are classified
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below. 

Impaired Loans (Collateral Dependent) 

The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations
of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation
approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the
appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging
reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of
the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3
fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.

Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans
are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential
properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of management
reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with
independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The following table presents the carrying amount and
estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments not carried at fair value and the level within the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

The following methods were used to estimate the fair
value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying balance sheets at amounts other than fair value. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Interest-earning
Time Deposits 

The carrying amount of cash, short-term instruments
and time deposits approximate fair value and are classified as Level 1.

(unaudited) 

Other Investment Securities 

Due to restrictions placed on their transferability,
the FHLB and COCC stock are carried at cost, which approximates fair value based on redemption provisions resulting in a Level
3 classification. 

Loans 

Fair values of loans are estimated as follows: For
variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values,
resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest
rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality, resulting in a Level 3 classification.
Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value of collateral as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate
the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 

Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable 

The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate
fair value, resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Deposits 

The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g.,
interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to
the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. The carrying
amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting
date resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted
cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected
monthly maturities on time deposits, resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

The fair values of FHLB advances are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, resulting in a
Level 2 classification. 

Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance 

The fair value of escrow accounts is estimated to approximate
the carrying amount resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Off Balance Sheet Instruments 

Fair values of off-balance sheet, credit-related
financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms
of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material.

     Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

FASB ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts
with Customers . In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance on revenue
recognition from contracts with customers. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting
for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most contract revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific
guidance. The core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
and interim periods within the reporting period, and should be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented
or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application.
Early adoption is prohibited. Management is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on the Company s
financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2016-01   Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . For public business entities, the
amendments in this update include the elimination of the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used
to estimate fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet,
the requirement to use the exit price

notion when measuring fair value of financial instruments
for disclosure purposes, the requirement to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in
the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure
the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, the requirement for separate presentation
of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans
and receivables) on the balance sheet or accompanying notes to the financial statements, and the amendments clarify that an entity
should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination
with the entity's other deferred tax assets. 

For public business entities, the amendments in
this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption of the amendments in this update is not permitted, except that early application by public business entities to
financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued or, by all other entities, that have not
yet been made available for issuance are permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption for the following amendment:
An entity should present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value
in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. An entity should apply the amendments to this update by means
of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Management is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the Company s financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2016-02,   Leases.  In February
2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for
all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 

A lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and    

A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.   

Under the new guidance, lessor
accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the
lessee accounting model and Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for
sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer
be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. 

Public business entities should apply the amendments
in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January
1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities upon issuance. Lessees (for
capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective
transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented

in the financial statements. The modified retrospective
approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this guidance on the Company s financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2016-13   Financial Instruments-Credit
Losses.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13. The amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss model for recognition
of credit losses with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses over the life of the loan and requires consideration of
a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. The amendments are effective for
public business entities for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of these amendments to the Company s financial position and results of operations. 

Note 8:   
       Plan of Conversion and Change in Corporate Form    

On August 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the
Company adopted a plan of conversion (Plan). The Plan is subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of
the total votes eligible to be cast by the voting members of the Company at a special meeting. The Plan sets forth that the Company
proposes to convert into a stock savings bank structure with the establishment of a stock holding company (Community Savings Bancorp,
Inc.), as parent of the Company. The Company will convert to the stock form of ownership, followed by the issuance of all of the
Company s outstanding stock to Community Savings Bancorp, Inc. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company will determine the total
offering value and number of shares of common stock based upon an independent appraiser s valuation. The stock will be priced
at $10.00 per share. In addition, the Company s Board of Directors will adopt an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) which
will subscribe for up to 8% of the common stock sold in the offering. Community Savings Bancorp, Inc. is organized as a corporation
under the laws of the State of Maryland and will own all of the outstanding common stock of the Company upon completion of the
conversion. 

The costs of issuing the common stock will be deferred
and deducted from the sales proceeds of the offering. If the conversion is unsuccessful, all deferred costs will be charged to
operations. The Company had incurred deferred conversion costs totaling $368,000 as of September 30, 2016. 

At the completion of the conversion to stock form,
the Company will establish a liquidation account in the amount of retained earnings contained in the final prospectus. The liquidation
account will be maintained for the benefits of eligible savings account holders who maintain deposit accounts in the Company after
conversion.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

Management s discussion and analysis
of the financial condition at September 30, 2016 and results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained
in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto,
appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on 

 Form 10-Q. 

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements,
which can be identified by the use of words such as  estimate,   project,   believe,   intend, 
 anticipate,   plan,   seek,   expect  and similar expressions. These forward-looking
statements include: statements of goals, intentions and expectations, statements regarding prospects and business strategy, statements
regarding asset quality and market risk, and estimates of future costs, benefits and results. 

These forward-looking statements are subject
to significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, among other things, the following: (1) general economic conditions,
(2) competitive pressure among financial services companies, (3) changes in interest rates, (4) deposit flows, (5) loan demand,
(6) changes in legislation or regulation, (7) changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines, (8) other economic, competitive,
governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and (9) other risk
factors set forth from time to time in the Company s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including
those described in  Risk Factors  within the Company s Form S-1. 

Because of these and other uncertainties,
our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. We have no
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any changed assumptions, any unanticipated events or any
changes in the future. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to
make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting
policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions,
resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of
operations.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ) contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying
public companies. As an  emerging growth company  we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements
applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage
of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that
comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

The following represent our critical accounting
policies: 

Allowance for Loan Losses.   The
allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the
loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against
income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as
one of our most critical accounting policies. 

Management performs a quarterly evaluation
of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not
limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying
collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation
is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. 

The analysis has two components, specific
and general allowances. The specific percentage allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be
impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans,
the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than
the loan s carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively,
is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze
historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis
establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of
the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining
the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors
beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual
loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect
on our financial results. 

Deferred Tax Assets.   We use
the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will
not be realized. We exercise significant judgment 

Table of Contents   

Community
Savings  

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting
tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates
we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory
and business factors change. Determining the proper valuation allowance for deferred taxes is critical in properly valuing the
deferred tax asset and the related recognition of income tax expense or benefit. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income
may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 

Fair Value Measurements  . The
fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Bank estimates the fair value of a financial instrument
and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have
quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other
observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine
fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Bank estimates fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature
and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the
fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Company can be found in Note
13 of the Financial Statements    Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities,  included in the Registrant s
S-1 filing. 

Comparison of Financial
Condition at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016   

Total Assets.   Total assets
decreased $673,000, or 1.2%, to $53.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $54.3 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was due primarily
to decreases in interest-earning time deposits in other financial institutions, available-for-sale securities, and net loans, offset
in part by increases in cash and cash equivalents and deferred conversion costs in other assets. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents.   Cash
and cash equivalents increased $893,000, or 28.0%, to $4.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $3.2 million at June 30, 2016. The
increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to funds retained from maturities of interest-earning time deposits in
other financial institutions and available-for-sale securities. 

Interest-earning Time Deposits in
Other Financial Institutions.   Interest-earning time deposits in other financial institutions decreased $997,000, or 17.9%,
to $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $5.6 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was due to maturities of these deposits
during the period. 

Securities available-for-sale.   Investments
in securities available-for-sale decreased $485,000, or 4.4%, to $10.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $11.1 million at June
30, 2016. The decrease in securities available-for-sale was primarily due to maturities of $1.5 million and principal repayments
on mortgage-backed securities totaling $460,000, partially offset by purchases of $1.4 million. Net proceeds from maturities of
securities, as well as maturities of interest-earning time deposits in other financial institutions, were used in part to fund
repayments of Federal Home Loan Bank advances and held in cash and cash equivalents.

Net Loans.   Net loans decreased
$436,000, or 1.3%, to $32.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $32.6 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in net loans was due
primarily to a decrease of $360,000, or 7.4%, in consumer loans to $4.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $4.9 million at June
30, 2016, and a decrease of $178,000, or 10.8%, in commercial real estate and multifamily loans, to $1.5 million at September 30,
2016 from $1.6 million at June 30, 2016. Partially offsetting these decreases, one-to four-family residential real estate loans
increased $162,000, or 0.7%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Loans originated during the three months ended September
30, 2016 totaled $1.5 million, of which $1.4 million were loans secured by one-to four-family residential real estate. 

Other Assets.   Other assets
increased $384,000, or 201.0%, to $575,000 at September 30, 2016 from $191,000 at June 30, 2016. The increase was due primarily
to conversion costs incurred of $368,000. These costs have been deferred and will ultimately be offset against the proceeds of
the sale of common stock upon completion of the stock offering. 

Deposits.   Deposits increased
$178,000, or 0.4%, to $40.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $40.1 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was comprised of growth
in demand deposits of $1.2 million, partially offset by decreases in savings and money market accounts of $894,000 and in certificates
of deposit of $101,000. 

FHLB Advances.   FHLB advances
decreased $1.1 million, or 14.5%, to $6.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $7.3 million at June 30, 2016, as we utilized funds
from maturing interest-earning time deposits in other financial institutions and investment securities available for sale to repay
certain FHLB advances. 

Total Equity.   Total equity
increased $10,000, or 0.2%, and approximated $6.7 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The increase resulted from net
income of $4,000 and other comprehensive income of $6,000 during the period. 

Comparison of Operating
Results for the Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

General.   For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $4,000 compared to net income of $628,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of $624,000. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from a decrease of $794,000 in noninterest income,
which included an $810,000 one-time gain on sale of branch offices realized in the 2015 quarter, offset in part by a decrease of
$134,000 in noninterest expense and a decrease of $39,000 in federal income tax. 

Average Balance Sheets.   The
following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated.
All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have
been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs,
discounts and premiums that are accreted to interest income.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Interest Income.   Interest
income decreased $6,000, or 1.3%, to $439,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $445,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from a $21,000 decrease in interest on investment securities offset in
part by a $17,000 increase in interest on loans receivable. The average balance of investment securities decreased $5.4 million,
or 33.4%, to $10.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $16.1 million during the three months ended September
30, 2015, and the average yield on investment securities increased 11 basis points to 1.90% for the 2016 period from 1.79% for
the 2015 period. The average balance of loans receivable increased $3.2 million, or 10.7%, to $32.7 million during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $29.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015, but the average yield on loans decreased
23 basis points to 4.36% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.59% during the year earlier period, reflecting
lower market interest rates. 

Interest Expense.   Interest
expense decreased $3,000, or 5.5%, to $52,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $55,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Interest expense on deposits decreased $9,000, or 23.1%, to $30,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 from $39,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $5.7 million,
or 14.9%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, resulting primarily from our branch sales in July 2015, to $32.6
million for the three month period in 2016 from $38.3 million for the comparable period in 2015, and a decrease of four basis points
in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.37% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.41% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting the declining interest rate environment. Interest expense on borrowings increased $6,000
to $22,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $16,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average
balance of FHLB advances increased $972,000 to $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.6 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, while the average cost of these advances increased 19 basis points to 1.34% from 1.15%
period-to-period. 

Net Interest Income.   Net interest
income decreased $3,000, or 0.8%, to $387,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $390,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Our net interest rate spread increased to 2.93% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.71%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and our net interest margin increased to 3.05% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from 2.82% for the comparable three-month period in 2015. 

Provision for Loan Losses.  
Based on our analysis of the factors described in  Critical Accounting Policies   Allowance for Loan Losses, 
we did not record a provision for loan losses for either of the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The allowance for
loan losses was $253,000, or 0.78% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $275,000, or 0.91% of total loans, at September
30, 2015. Total nonperforming loans were $324,000 at September 30, 2016, compared to $272,000 at September 30, 2015. Classified
(substandard, doubtful and loss) loans were $855,000 at September 30, 2016, compared to $844,000 at September 30, 2015, and total
loans past due greater than 30 days were $264,000 and $291,000 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Bank had no net
charge-offs during either of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance
for loan losses was 78.1% at September 30, 2016 compared to 101.1% at September 30, 2015.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The allowance for loan losses reflects the
estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at September
30, 2016 and 2015. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are
reasonable, the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions
that may be required may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest
income decreased $794,000, or 88.9%, to $99,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $893,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an $810,000 one-time gain on sale of branch offices in July 2015 realized
during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, service charges and fees decreased $18,000 to $65,000 during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, which resulted from the loss of customers at our former
branch offices following the July 2015 sale. These decreases were partially offset by a gain of $29,000 on sale of foreclosed assets
in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss on sale of $1,000 in the 2015 quarter. 

Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest
expense decreased $134,000, or 21.7%, to $484,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $618,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Occupancy and equipment decreased $22,000, or 46.8%, to $25,000 during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $47,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Similarly, our data processing, correspondent
bank service charges, and FDIC insurance premiums all decreased period-to-period resulting from cost savings from our branch sales
in July 2015. 

Noninterest expense can be expected to increase
because of costs associated with operating as a public company and increased compensation costs related to possible implementation
of a stock-based benefit plan, if approved by our stockholders. Additionally, we intend to withdraw from our multiple-employer
defined benefit plan following completion of the conversion and expect to incur a one-time charge of approximately $1.6 million
in connection with this withdrawal. 

Federal Income Taxes  . We recognized
a federal income tax benefit of $2,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $39,000 from the $37,000 expense
recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease resulted from a decline in pre-tax income of $663,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources  

Our primary sources of funds are deposits,
principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from sale of loans and advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati. While maturities and
scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced
by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including
interest-earning demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing
activities during any given period. 

Our cash flows are comprised of three primary
classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating
activities was $191,000

and $11,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $1.9 million and $(12.7 million) for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in cash flows in investing activities resulted primarily
from the sale of two branch offices in July 2015 which resulted in cash paid of $12.6 million during the three months ended September
30, 2015. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(821,000) and $5.4 million in the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Community Savings is subject to various
regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition
of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to
broad risk categories. At September 30, 2016, Community Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was categorized
as  well-capitalized  under regulatory guidelines. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations  

Commitments.   At September
30, 2016, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $50,000, commitments under undisbursed construction loans of $442,000
and commitments under home equity lines of credit of $2.3 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to
meet our current loan origination commitments. 

Certificates of deposit that are scheduled
to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2016 totaled $4.4 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of
the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may
utilize FHLB-Cincinnati advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels
of interest expense. 

Contractual Obligations.   In
the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing
services, operating leases for equipment and a branch location, and agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.
