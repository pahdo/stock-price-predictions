CHOICE HOTELS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. 
    Company Information and Significant Accounting Policies 
     The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Choice Hotels International, Inc. and subsidiaries (together the "Company") have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary, in the opinion of management, to fairly present our financial position and results of operations. Except as otherwise disclosed, all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been omitted. The Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  
  The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016 (the "10-K").  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the entire year results. All inter-company transactions and balances between Choice Hotels International, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  
  The Company maintains cash balances in domestic banks, which at times, may exceed the limits of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, the Company also maintains cash balances in international banks and money market funds which do not provide deposit insurance. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance  
    
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-01,   Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   ("ASU No. 2015-01").  ASU No. 2015-01 changes the requirements for reporting extraordinary and unusual items in the income statement by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items.  The presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently is retained and expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.  ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2016 and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810)   ("ASU No. 2015-02"). ASU No. 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance must be applied using one of two retrospective application methods and is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2016 and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,   Intangibles-Goodwill - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)   ("ASU No. 2015-05"). ASU No. 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license or should be accounted for as a service contract. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2016, and elected to apply the revised standard prospectively to all new or materially altered agreements signed by the Company.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of the date of adoption. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU No. 2016-09"). ASU No. 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit to the income statement. The Company must also make an  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

accounting policy election of whether to account for forfeitures based on an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest or to account for forfeitures when they occur. In addition, excess tax benefits are required to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods for those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, but if elected, a Company must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. 
    
  The Company adopted the new guidance in the second quarter of 2016 and, in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2016-09 applied the required adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption.  The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the Company's provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in-capital during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded. The Company has elected to continue to estimate forfeitures based on an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest. 
    
  The Company also elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively which resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and an increase in net cash used by financing activities of   $4.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of tax benefits of   $0.7 million   and   $2.1 million   in our provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in-capital for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   
    
  The impact of the adoption to our previously reported first quarter 2016 results was   $1.6 million  , reflected as follows: 

Future Adoption of Recently Announced Accounting Guidance 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue From Contracts with Customers      (Topic 606)   ("ASU No. 2014-09"), which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity's revenue recognition. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as most industry-specific guidance, and significantly enhances comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and industries by providing a principles-based, comprehensive framework for addressing revenue recognition issues. In order for a provider of promised goods or services to recognize as revenue the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services, the provider should apply the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer(s); (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and provides enhanced disclosure requirements. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting

period. The guidance permits the retrospective or modified retrospective method when adopting ASU No. 2014-09 but early application is not permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is still assessing the impact that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its financial statements and disclosures, but believes it could impact the timing of revenue recognition for the Company's initial franchise fees and timing of the recognition for profits from the sales of real estate assets.  
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (Topic 606)   ("ASU No. 2016-10").  ASU No. 2016-10 does not change the core principles of the standard, ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , but clarifies the accounting for licenses of intellectual property, as well as the identification of distinct performance obligations in a contract. The standard should be adopted concurrently with adoption of ASU 2014-09, which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is still assessing the impact that ASU No. 2016-10 will have on its financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU No. 2016-02"). ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet by recording a liability for its lease obligation and an asset for its right to use the underlying asset as of the lease commencement date. The standard requires entities to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease or a service agreement as the accounting treatment is significantly different between the two arrangements. The standard also requires the lessee to evaluate whether a lease is a financing lease or an operating lease as the accounting and presentation guidance between the two are different. ASU No. 2016-02 also modifies the classification criteria and accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases for lessors. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on the financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ("ASU No. 2016-13"), which will require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that ASU No. 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU No. 2016-15").  ASU No. 2016-15 provides additional guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, such as the classification of debt prepayments or extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, and distributions received from equity method investees.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on the financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  I  n October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ("ASU No. 2016-16").  ASU No. 2016-16 provides guidance on recognition of current income tax consequences for intercompany asset transfers (other than inventory) at the time of transfer.  This represents a change from current GAAP, where the consolidated tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers are deferred from the time of transfer to a future period.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption at the beginning of an annual period is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that ASU No. 2016-16 will have on the financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Consolidation (Topic 810) - Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control   ("ASU No. 2016-17").  ASU No. 2016-17 alters the primary beneficiary assessment a reporting entity must perform as part of consolidation analysis to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  Under current GAAP, indirect interests held through related parties under common control are to be considered in their entirety by the reporting entity in performing the primary beneficiary assessment.  ASU No. 2016-17 will revise the guidance such that indirect interests held through related parties under common control will be considered on a proportionate basis in performing the primary beneficiary assessment.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that ASU No. 2016-17 will have on the financial statements and disclosures.

    Notes Receivable and Allowance for Losses 
     The Company segregates its notes receivable for the purposes of evaluating allowances for credit losses between   two   categories:   Mezzanine and Other Notes Receivable   and   Forgivable Notes Receivable  . The Company utilizes the level of security it has in the various notes receivable as its primary credit quality indicator (i.e., senior, subordinated or unsecured) when determining the appropriate allowances for uncollectible loans within these categories.  
  The Company considers loans to be past due and in default when payments are not made when due. Although the Company considers loans to be in default if payments are not received on the due date, the Company does not suspend the accrual of interest until those payments are more than 30 days past due.  The Company applies payments received for loans on non-accrual status first to interest and then principal. The Company does not resume interest accrual until all delinquent payments are received. For impaired loans, the Company recognizes interest income on a cash basis.  
  The following table shows the composition of the Company's notes receivable balances: 

The Company classifies notes receivable due within one year as current assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.

  Forgivable Notes Receivable  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unamortized balance of the Company's forgivable notes receivable totaled   $51.4 million   and   $44.3 million  , respectively. The Company recorded an allowance for credit losses on these forgivable notes receivable of   $5.1 million   and   $4.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Amortization expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income related to the notes for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $2.3 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively. Amortization expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income related to the notes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $6.7 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively. 
  Past due balances of forgivable notes receivable are as follows: 

Mezzanine and Other Notes Receivable  
  The Company determined that approximately   $1.9 million   and   $0.8 million   of its mezzanine and other notes receivable were impaired at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company recorded allowance for credit losses on these impaired loans totaling   $1.6 million   and   $0.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The average mezzanine and other notes receivable on non-accrual status was approximately   $1.4 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recognizes interest income for impaired loans on a cash basis.    No   interest income on impaired loans was recognized during the   three months ended September 30,     2016, and 2015  .  Approximately   $43 thousand   and   $33 thousand   of interest income on impaired loans was recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30,      2016, and 2015  , respectively. The Company provided loan reserves on non-impaired loans totaling   $1.1 million   and   $1.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

    Marketing and Reservation Activities 
     The Company s franchise agreements require the payment of franchise fees, which include marketing and reservation system fees. The Company is obligated to use the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from the current franchisees comprising its various hotel brands to provide marketing and reservation services appropriate to support the operation of the overall system. In discharging its obligation to provide sufficient and appropriate marketing and reservation services, the Company has the right to expend funds in an amount reasonably necessary to ensure the provision of such services, whether or not such amount is currently available to the Company for reimbursement. The franchise agreements provide the Company the right to advance monies to the franchise system when the needs of the system surpass the balances currently available. As a result, expenditures by the Company in support of marketing and reservation services in excess of available revenues are deferred and recorded as an asset in the Company s financial statements. Conversely, cumulative marketing and reservation system fees not expended in the current period are deferred and recorded as a liability in the financial statements and are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements or utilized to reimburse the Company for prior year advances. 
  Under the terms of these agreements, the Company has the contractually enforceable right to assess and collect from its current franchisees, fees sufficient to pay for the marketing and reservation services the Company has procured for the benefit of the franchise system, including fees to reimburse the Company for past services rendered. The Company has the contractual authority to require that the franchisees in the system at any given point repay any deficits related to marketing and reservation activities. The Company s current franchisees are contractually obligated to pay any assessment the Company imposes on its franchisees to obtain reimbursement of such deficit regardless of whether those constituents continue to generate gross room revenue and whether or not they joined the system following the deficit's occurrence.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , cumulative marketing and reservation system costs exceeded cumulative marketing and reservation system revenues earned by   $15.3 million   with the excess reflected as a long-term asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  At   December 31, 2015   fees collected exceeded expenses by   $30.7 million  , with the excess reflected as an other long-term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

    Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
       
  The Company maintains a portfolio of investments owned through noncontrolling interest in equity method investments with one or more partners. Investments in unconsolidated entities include investments in joint ventures totaling   $81.1 million   and   $64.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, that the Company determined to be variable interest entities ("VIEs"). These investments relate to the Company's program to offer equity support to qualified franchisees to develop and operate Cambria hotel   suites hotels in strategic markets.  Based on an analysis of who has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these entities performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of these entities or a right to receive benefits from these entities that could potentially be significant to the entity, the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any of its VIEs. The Company based its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and the relevant development, operating management and financial agreements.  Although the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, it does exercise significant influence through its equity ownership and as a result the Company's investment in these entities is accounted for under the equity method. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized loss (income) totaling   $(0.4) million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, from these investments.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized losses totaling   $0.2 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, from these investments. The Company's maximum exposure to losses related to its investments in VIEs is limited to its equity investments as well as certain guarantees described in Note 17 "Commitments and Contingencies" of these financial statements.

  Revolving Credit Facilities 
    
  On July 21, 2015, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ), with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent. 
    
  The Credit Agreement provides for a   $450 million   unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) with an initial maturity date of July 21, 2020, subject to optional   one  -year extensions that can be requested by the Company prior to each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date of the Revolver. The effectiveness of any such extensions is subject to the consent of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and certain customary conditions. On July 5, 2016, the Company exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the Revolver by   one   year. The new maturity date of the Revolver is July 21, 2021. 
  Up to   $35 million   of borrowings under the Revolver may be used for alternative currency loans and up to   $15 million   of borrowings under the Revolver may be used for swing line loans.

     Table of Contents  

The Revolver is unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries, which are considered restricted subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement.  The subsidiary guarantors currently include all subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the Company's Indenture governing the terms of its   5.75%   senior notes due 2022 and its   5.70%   senior notes due 2020.  If the Company achieves and maintains an Investment Grade Rating, as defined in the Credit Agreement, then the subsidiary guarantees will, at the election of the Company, be released and the Revolver will not be guaranteed.    
    
  The Company may at any time prior to the final maturity date increase the amount of the Revolver by up to an additional   $150 million   to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to being a lender for the additional amount and certain other customary conditions are met.  
    
  The Company currently may elect to have borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   135   to   175   basis points based on the Company s total leverage ratio or (ii) a   base rate   plus a margin ranging from   35   to   75   basis points based on the Company s total leverage ratio. If the Company achieves an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company may elect to use a different, ratings-based, pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  The Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolver, calculated on the basis of the average daily unused amount of the Revolver multiplied by   0.20%   per annum.  If the Company achieves an Investment Grade Rating and it elects to use the ratings-based pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement, then the Company will be required to pay a fee on the total commitments under the Revolver, calculated on the basis of the actual daily amount of the commitments under the Revolver (regardless of usage) times a percentage per annum ranging from   0.10%   to   0.25%   (depending on the Company s senior unsecured long-term debt rating). 
    
  The Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries comply with various covenants, including with respect to restrictions on liens, incurring indebtedness, making investments and affecting mergers and/or asset sales. With respect to dividends, the Company may not declare or make any payment if there is an existing event of default or if the payment would create an event of default. In addition, if the Company s total leverage ratio exceeds   4.0   to 1.0, the Company is generally restricted from paying aggregate dividends in excess of   $50 million   in any calendar year.  
    
  The Credit Agreement imposes financial maintenance covenants requiring the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than   4.5   to 1.0 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least   2.5   to 1.0.  If the Company achieves and maintains an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company will not need to comply with the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant.  
    
  The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  The proceeds of the Revolver are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, debt repayment, stock repurchases, dividends, investments and other permitted uses set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
  Fixed Rate Collateralized Mortgage 
  On December 30, 2014, a court awarded the Company title to an office building as settlement for a portion of an outstanding loan receivable for which the building was pledged as collateral.  In conjunction with the court award, the Company also assumed the   $9.5 million   mortgage on the property with a fixed interest rate of   7.26%  .  The mortgage, which is collateralized by the office building, requires monthly payments of principal and interest and matures in December 2020 with a balloon payment due of   $6.9 million  . At the time of acquisition, the Company determined that the fixed interest rate of   7.26%   exceeded market interest rates and therefore the Company increased the carrying value of the debt by   $1.2 million   to record the debt at fair value. The fair value adjustment is being amortized over the remaining term of the mortgage utilizing the effective interest method. 
  Economic Development Loans 
  The Company entered into economic development agreements with various governmental entities in conjunction with the relocation of its corporate headquarters in April 2013.  In accordance with these agreements, the governmental entities agreed to advance approximately   $4.4 million   to the Company to offset a portion of the corporate headquarters relocation and tenant improvement costs in consideration of the employment of permanent, full-time employees within the jurisdictions. At

September 30, 2016  , the Company had been advanced approximately   $3.7 million   pursuant to these agreements and expects to receive the remaining   $0.7 million   over the next several years, subject to annual appropriations by the governmental entities.  These advances bear interest at a rate of   3%   per annum. 
  Repayment of the advances is contingent upon the Company achieving certain performance conditions.  Performance conditions are measured annually on December 31   st    and primarily relate to maintaining certain levels of employment within the various jurisdictions.  If the Company fails to meet an annual performance condition, the Company may be required to repay a portion or all of the advances including accrued interest by April 30   th    following the measurement date. Any outstanding advances at the expiration of the Company's   ten  -year corporate headquarters lease in 2023 will be forgiven in full. The advances will be included in long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets until the Company determines that the future performance conditions will be met over the entire term of the agreement and the Company will not be required to repay the advances.  The Company accrues interest on the portion of the advances that it expects to repay. The Company was in compliance with all current performance conditions as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Non-Qualified Retirement, Savings and Investment Plans 
     The Company sponsors   two   non-qualified retirement savings and investment plans for certain employees and senior executives. Employee and Company contributions are maintained in separate irrevocable trusts. Legally, the assets of the trusts remain those of the Company; however, access to the trusts  assets is severely restricted. The trusts cannot be revoked by the Company

or an acquirer, but the assets are subject to the claims of the Company s general creditors. The participants do not have the right to assign or transfer contractual rights in the trusts. 
  In 2002, the Company adopted the Choice Hotels International, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP"), which became effective January 1, 2003. Under the EDCP, certain executive officers may defer a portion of their salary into an irrevocable trust and invest these amounts in a selection of available diversified investment options. In 1997, the Company adopted the Choice Hotels International, Inc. Non-Qualified Retirement Savings and Investment Plan ("Non-Qualified Plan"). The Non-Qualified Plan allows certain employees who do not participate in the EDCP to defer a portion of their salary and invest these amounts in a selection of available diversified investment options.  Under the EDCP and Non-Qualified Plan, (together, the "Deferred Compensation Plan"), the Company recorded current and long-term deferred compensation liabilities of   $24.3 million   and   $23.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to these deferrals and credited investment return under these two deferred compensation plans. Compensation expense is recorded in SG A expense on the Company s consolidated statements of income based on the change in the deferred compensation obligation related to earnings credited to participants as well as changes in the fair value of diversified investments. The net increase (decrease) in compensation expense recorded in SG A for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $0.9 million   and   $(1.0) million  , respectively. The net increase (decrease) in compensation expense recorded in SG A for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $1.4 million   and   $(0.9) million   respectively. 
  Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Company has invested the employee salary deferrals in diversified long-term investments which are intended to provide investment returns that offset the earnings credited to the participants. The diversified investments held in the trusts totaled   $18.9 million   and   $17.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are recorded at their fair value, based on quoted market prices. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects   $2.5 million   of the assets held in the trust to be distributed during the next twelve months to participants. These investments are considered trading securities and therefore the changes in the fair value of the diversified assets is included in other gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company recorded investment gains (losses) during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   of approximately   $0.8 million   and   $(1.1) million  , respectively. The Company recorded investment gains (losses) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   of approximately   $1.0 million   and   $(1.0) million  , respectively.

    Fair Value Measurements 
     The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments utilizing a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs, as well as the assets that the Company values using those levels of inputs. 
  Level 1  : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company s Level 1 assets consist of marketable securities (primarily mutual funds) held in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. 
  Level 2  : Observable inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable. The Company s Level 2 assets consist of money market funds held in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan and those recorded in cash and cash equivalents. 
  Level 3  : Unobservable inputs, supported by little or no market data available, where the reporting entity is required to develop its own assumptions to determine the fair value of the instrument.  The Company does not currently have any assets whose fair value was determined using Level 3 inputs.  
    
  The Company's policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of each quarterly reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 assets during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had the following assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

________________________  
           (1) 
    Included in Investments, employee benefit plans at fair value and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
     Other Financial Instruments 
  The Company believes that the fair value of its current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these items. In addition, the interest rates of the Company's Credit Facility adjust frequently based on current market rates; accordingly its carrying amount approximates fair value.  
  The Company estimates the fair value of notes receivable, which approximate their carrying value, utilizing an analysis of future cash flows and credit worthiness for similar types of arrangements.  Based upon the availability of market data, the notes receivable have been classified as Level 3 inputs. The primary sensitivity in these calculations is based on the selection of appropriate interest and discount rates. For further information on the notes receivables, see Note 3. 
  The fair values of the Company's   $250 million   and   $400 million   senior notes are classified as Level 2 as the significant inputs are observable in an active market.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the   $250 million   senior notes had an approximate fair value of   $272.9 million   and   $267.7 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the   $400 million   senior notes had an approximate fair value of   $439.4 million   and   $432.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  Fair values estimated are made at a specific point in time, are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment.  Settlement of such fair value amounts may not be possible and may not be a prudent management decision. 

The effective income tax rates were   32.2%   and   33.5%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. The effective income tax rates were   31.1%   and   32.4%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  The effective income tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate of   35.0%   due to the impact of foreign operations, partially offset by state income taxes.  The effective income tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was also impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The adoption resulted in a   $0.7 million   and   $2.1 million   tax benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was further reduced by the settlement of unrecognized tax positions.

    Share-Based Compensation and Capital Stock 
     Stock Options 
  No   stock options were granted during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  The Company granted   0.7 million   and   0.5 million   options to certain employees of the Company at a fair value of   $6.9 million   and   $6.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The stock options granted by the Company had an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of the options granted was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

The expected life of the options and volatility are based on historical data, which is believed to be indicative of future exercise patterns or actual volatility. Historical volatility is calculated based on a period that corresponds to the expected term of the stock option. The dividend yield and the risk-free rate of return are calculated on the grant date based on the then current dividend rate and the risk-free rate of return for the period corresponding to the expected life of the stock option. Compensation expense related to the fair value of these awards is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period based on those awards that ultimately vest.  
  The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding and exercisable at   September 30, 2016   was   $10.4 million   and   $10.1 million  , respectively.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $2.4 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $6.8 million   and   $9.5 million  , respectively.  
  The Company received approximately   $2.6 million   and   $0.7 million   in proceeds from the exercise of   104,442   and   30,808   employee stock options during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Company received approximately   $6.8 million   and   $6.4 million   in proceeds from the exercise of   297,398   and   263,600   employee stock options during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Restricted Stock 
  The following table is a summary of activity related to restricted stock grants:    

Compensation expense related to the fair value of these awards is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period based on those restricted stock grants that ultimately vest. The fair value of grants is measured by the market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over the service period beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. Awards granted to retirement eligible non-employee directors are recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or the length of time until retirement since the terms of the grant provide that the awards will vest upon retirement.

Performance Vested Restricted Stock Units 
  The Company has granted performance vested restricted stock units ("PVRSU") to certain employees. The fair value is measured by the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. The vesting of these stock awards is contingent upon the Company achieving performance targets at the end of specified performance periods and the employees' continued employment. The performance conditions affect the number of shares that will ultimately vest. The range of possible stock-based award vesting is generally between   0%   and   200%   of the initial target. If minimum performance targets are not attained, then no awards will vest under the terms of the various PVRSU agreements. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the Company's estimate of the achievement of the various performance targets. The Company has currently estimated that between   0%   and   175%   of the various award targets will be achieved. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period only on those PVRSUs that ultimately vest.  
  The following table is a summary of activity related to PVRSU grants: 

No   PVRSU grants vested during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PVRSU grants totaling   22,062   vested at a grant date fair value of   $0.8 million  .   These PVRSU grants were initially granted at a target of   44,118   units. However, since the Company achieved only   50%   of the targeted performance conditions contained in the stock awards granted in prior periods,   22,056   shares were forfeited.  In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PVRSU grants totaling   6,126   vested at a grant date fair value of   $0.2 million  .  These PVRSU grants were initially granted at a target of   4,083   units.  However, since the Company achieved   150%   of the targeted performance conditions contained in the stock awards granted in prior periods, an additional   2,043   shares were earned and issued.    
  No   PVRSU grants vested during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a total of   42,326   PVRSU grants vested at a grant date fair value of   $1.5 million  .   These PVRSU grants were initially granted at a target of   38,476   units. However, since the Company achieved   110%   of the targeted performance conditions contained in the stock awards granted in prior periods, an additional   3,850   shares were earned and issued.

A summary of stock-based award activity as of   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine   months ended are presented below: 

_________________________________   
   (1)   PVRSU units outstanding have been increased by   2,043     units due to the Company exceeding the targeted performance conditions contained in PVRSUs granted in prior periods during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The components of the Company s pretax share-based compensation expense and associated income tax benefits are as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

In conjunction with the termination of a Company officer, stock option, restricted stock and performance vested restricted stock compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, included an additional   $0.4 million  ,   $0.4 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, of accelerated recognition of share based payment awards.   
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company revised its estimate of the projected achievement of various performance conditions that affect the number of PVRSUs that will ultimately vest.  As a result, previously recognized share-based compensation costs related to these PVRSUs increased by   $0.4 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Dividends 
  The Company currently pays a   quarterly   dividend on its common stock of   $0.205   per share, however the declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's board of directors declared dividends totaling   $0.205   and   $0.615   per share or approximately   $11.5 million   and   $34.6 million  , respectively, in the aggregate.  
  In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded dividends totaling   $0.1 million   related to previously declared dividends that were contingent upon the vesting of performance vested restricted stock units.

Share Repurchases and Redemptions 
  The Company purchased   0.1 million   and   0.6 million   shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of   $5.6 million   and   $28.6 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company redeemed   1,284   and   118,063   shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately   $61 thousand   and   $5.4 million  , respectively, from employees to satisfy the option exercise price and statutory minimum tax-withholding requirements related to the exercising of stock options and vesting of performance vested restricted stock units and restricted stock grants.  

14.  Earnings Per Share  
  The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows:       

The Company's unvested restricted shares contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, and thus are participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share ("EPS"). The calculation of EPS for common stock shown above excludes the income attributable to the unvested restricted share awards from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those awards from the denominator. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had   2.5 million   and   2.1 million   outstanding stock options, respectively. Stock options are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method and average market prices during the period, unless the stock options would be anti-dilutive. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company excluded   1.2 million   of anti-dilutive stock options from the diluted earnings per share calculation.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company excluded   0.5 million   of anti-dilutive stock options from the diluted earnings per share calculation.

PVRSUs are also included in the diluted earnings per share calculation when the performance conditions have been met at the reporting date. However, at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , PVRSUs totaling   235,980   and   207,040  , respectively, were excluded from the computation since the performance conditions had not been met.

16.  Reportable Segment Information 
    
  Franchising:   Franchising includes the Company's hotel franchising operations consisting of its   eleven   brands.  The   eleven   brands are aggregated within this segment considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels and regulatory business environments. Revenues from the franchising business include royalty fees, initial franchise and relicensing fees, marketing and reservation system fees, procurement services revenue and other franchising related revenue. The Company is obligated under its franchise agreements to provide marketing and reservation services appropriate for the operation of its systems. These services do not represent separate reportable segments as their operations are directly related to the Company's franchising business. The revenues received from franchisees that are used to pay for part of the Company's ongoing operations are included in franchising revenues and are offset by the related expenses paid for marketing and reservation activities to calculate franchising operating income.  
  SkyTouch Technology:   SkyTouch Technology ("SkyTouch") is a division of the Company that develops and markets cloud-based technology products to hoteliers not under franchise agreements with the Company.  
  The Company evaluates its segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, income taxes or indirect general and administrative expenses, which are included in the Corporate and Other column. Corporate and Other Revenues include rental income related to an office building owned by the Company, as well as revenues from a recently acquired company, which provides technological services for vacation rental management companies.  Equity in earnings or losses from hotel franchising related joint ventures is allocated to the Company's franchising segment. As described in Note 4, certain interest expenses related to the Company's marketing and reservation activities are allocated to the franchising segment. The Company does not allocate the remaining interest expense, interest income, other gains and losses or income taxes to its segments.  
  The following table presents the financial information for the Company's segments:  

17. 
    Commitments and Contingencies  
     The Company is not a party to any litigation other than litigation in the ordinary course of business.  The Company's management and legal counsel do not expect that the ultimate outcome of any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Contingencies 
  On October 9, 2012, the Company entered into a limited payment guaranty with regards to a VIE's   $18.0 million   bank loan for the construction of a hotel franchised under one of the Company's brands in the United States.  Under the terms of the limited guaranty, the Company agreed to guarantee   25%   of the outstanding principal balance for a maximum exposure of   $4.5 million   and accrued unpaid interest, as well as any unpaid expenses incurred by the lender.  The limited guaranty shall remain in effect until the maximum amount guaranteed by the Company is paid in full.  In addition to the limited guaranty, the Company entered into an environmental indemnity agreement, which indemnifies the lending institution from and against any damages relating to or arising out of possible environmental contamination issues with regards to the property. 
    
  On September 4, 2015, the Company entered into a limited payment guaranty with regards to a VIE's   $13.3 million   bank loan for the design, development, and construction of a new hotel franchised under one of the Company's brands in the United States.  Under the terms of the limited guaranty, the Company has agreed to guarantee a maximum of   $1.8 million   of the VIE s obligations under the loan.  The limited guaranty shall remain in effect until (i) the VIE s bank loan is paid in full to the lender; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed by the Company is paid in full; or (iii) the Company, through its affiliate, ceases to be a member of the VIE.  
    
  On June 2, 2016, one of the Company s VIEs obtained a   $61.0 million   term loan for purposes of refinancing a   $46.2 million   construction loan. In connection with the refinancing, the Company entered into   three   limited guarantees. Under the terms of the limited guarantees, the Company agreed to guarantee a maximum obligation of   $3.3 million   in the aggregate, in addition to a percentage of any operating expenses and capital expenditures not covered by operating revenues and unpaid expenses incurred.   The limited guarantees will remain in effect until the loan is repaid in full or the VIE reaches a specified debt yield for two consecutive quarters under the loan covenants. The maturity date of the VIE's loan is June 2019. 
  The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under the aforementioned limited payment guarantees was remote at     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Commitments 
  The Company has the following commitments outstanding at   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    The Company provides financing in the form of forgivable promissory notes or cash incentives to franchisees for property improvements, hotel development efforts and other purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had commitments to extend an additional   $150.3 million   for these purposes provided certain conditions are met by its franchisees, of which   $83.7 million   is expected to be advanced in the next twelve months.  
                
    The Company committed to make additional capital contributions totaling   $24.1 million   to existing joint ventures related to the construction of various hotels to be operated under the Company's Cambria hotel   suites brand.  These commitments are expected to be funded in the next twelve months. 
                
    In November 2015, the Company provided financing to a development company to acquire and redevelop a historic office building into a Cambria hotel   suites hotel.  The Company has committed to provide up to an aggregate of   $49.1 million  , if necessary, for acquisition of the property and property improvements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company advanced   $21.1 million  . The promissory notes mature on November 30, 2019, and bear interest at variable and fixed rates and are payable monthly.   
                
    In September 2016, the Company committed to provide financing to a development company to construct a Cambria hotel   suites hotel in the amount of   $2.1 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amounts have been funded under the commitment.  The promissory note matures on March 29, 2020, and bears interest at fixed rates and is payable monthly. 
     In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into numerous agreements that contain standard indemnities whereby the Company indemnifies another party for breaches of representations and warranties. Such indemnifications are granted under various agreements, including those governing (i) purchases or sales of assets or businesses, (ii) leases of real estate, (iii) licensing of trademarks, (iv) access to credit facilities, (v) issuances of debt or equity securities, and (vi) certain operating agreements. The indemnifications issued are for the benefit of the (i) buyers in sale agreements and sellers in purchase agreements, (ii) landlords in lease contracts, (iii) franchisees in licensing agreements, (iv) financial institutions in credit facility arrangements, (v) underwriters in debt or equity security issuances and (vi) parties under certain operating agreements. In addition, these parties are also generally indemnified against any third party claim resulting from the transaction that is contemplated in the underlying agreement. While some of these indemnities extend only for the duration of the underlying  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

agreement, many survive the expiration of the term of the agreement or extend into perpetuity (unless subject to a legal statute of limitations). There are no specific limitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnities, nor is the Company able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability. With respect to certain of the aforementioned indemnities, such as indemnifications of landlords against third party claims for the use of real estate property leased by the Company, the Company maintains insurance coverage that mitigates potential liability. 

18.  Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
    
  In March 2016, the Company entered into a promissory note with an individual who is a member of one of the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company advanced   $4.0 million   for the member to purchase the Company's interest in the unconsolidated joint venture for   $2.4 million   and fund the development of the property into a Cambria hotel   suites hotel.  A deferred gain of   $0.2 million   will be recognized when the promissory note matures on March 1, 2019. The promissory note bears interest at a fixed rate and is payable monthly.  
  The Company signed a management fee arrangement for marketing services with a joint venture partner.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , fees earned and payroll costs reimbursed under this arrangement totaled   $0.4 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively.  

19.  Acquisitions 
    
  On   August 11, 2015  , the Company acquired   100%   of the voting equity interest of Maxxton Holding B.V. ( MHB ) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, a Software as a Service ("SaaS") solution for vacation rental management companies. MHB provides central reservations systems, property management systems and integrated software applications including point-of-sale and is included in our Corporate and Other in our segment presentation found in Note 16. The total consideration was   $23.6 million  , which consisted of cash paid, net of cash acquired, of   $13.3 million  , deferred purchase price payable of   $6.8 million  , and liabilities assumed totaling   $3.5 million  .  The deferred purchase price is payable over   5 years  .  In addition, the Company has a   5   year variable compensation arrangement with MHB's former owner, which is contingent on future minimum performance targets.  As these amounts are contingent on achievement of certain targets and continued employment, no amounts were recorded for these future payments at the acquisition date.  The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.  The results of MHB have been consolidated with the Company since   August 11, 2015  . 
  The Company allocated the purchase price based upon a preliminary assessment of the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed as of   August 11, 2015  .  The Company completed its assessment of the MHB acquisition in the third quarter of 2016, identifying no adjustments to the fair value determination.  As a result, the purchase price allocation is final as of the third quarter of 2016, with no adjustments made from the preliminary allocation. 
  Real Estate Acquisitions 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed   three   acquisitions of real estate as part of its program to incent franchise development in strategic markets for certain brands.  The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was   $25.8 million   consisting of   $25.6 million   cash with an additional   $0.2 million   of current liabilities assumed.  In addition, the Company incurred   $0.5 million   in acquisition related costs, which were expensed in the period.  These acquisitions included:   
             
    On   January 8, 2016   the Company acquired a parcel of land in Milwaukee, WI.  The land is currently being utilized as a parking lot and will be developed into a Cambria hotel   suites hotel by the Company or through a future joint venture.   
                
    On   January 11, 2016  , the Company acquired a parcel of land and an office building in Indianapolis, IN. Subsequent to the acquisition, the land and building were utilized as a parking lot and actively managed office building.  The properties were sold during the current quarter, reference "Real Estate Disposition" below. 
                
    On   February 1, 2016  , the Company acquired an actively managed office building and surrounding parking area in Houston, TX. The Company's plan for the building is to convert the property into a Cambria hotel   suites hotel either through development or as a part of a joint venture agreement.   
     The Company completed its assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired in the first quarter of 2016 and as a result the allocation is final.  The results of operations, assets and liabilities have been reflected within the Company's franchising segment.  The fair value of the assets and liabilities and associated useful lives are as follows:

The gain recognized is net of transaction costs. 

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is intended to help the reader understand the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Choice Hotels International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together the "Company") contained in this report. MD A is provided as a supplement to-and should be read in conjunction with-our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. 

Overview  
  We are primarily a hotel franchisor with franchise agreements representing   6,419   hotels open and   745   hotels under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development as of   September 30, 2016  , with   509,152   rooms and   61,417   rooms, respectively, in   50   states, the District of Columbia and over 40 countries and territories outside the United States. Our brand names include Comfort Inn , Comfort Suites , Quality , Clarion , Ascend Hotel Collection , Sleep Inn , Econo Lodge , Rodeway Inn , MainStay Suites , Suburban Extended Stay Hotel , and Cambria hotel   suites  (collectively, the "Choice brands").  
  The Company's domestic franchising operations are conducted through direct franchising relationships while its international franchise operations are conducted through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising relationships. Master franchising relationships are governed by master franchising agreements which generally provide the master franchisee with the right to use our brands and sub-license the use of our brands in a specific geographic region, usually for a fee.  
  Our business strategy is to conduct direct franchising in those international markets where both franchising is an accepted business model and we believe our brands can achieve significant scale.  We elect to enter into master franchise agreements in those markets where direct franchising is currently not a prevalent or viable business model. When entering into master franchising relationships, we strive to select partners that have professional hotel and asset management capabilities together with the financial capacity to invest in building the Choice brands in their respective markets. Master franchising relationships typically provide lower revenues to the Company as the master franchisees are responsible for managing certain necessary services (such as training, quality assurance, reservations and marketing) to support the franchised hotels in the master franchise area and therefore, retain a larger percentage of the hotel franchise fees to cover their expenses. In certain circumstances, the Company has and may continue to make equity investments in our master franchisees.  
  As a result of our use of master franchising relationships and international market conditions, total revenues from international franchising operations comprised   6%   of our total revenues for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , while representing approximately   18%   of our franchise system hotels open as of   September 30, 2016  .  Therefore, our description of the franchise system is primarily focused on the domestic operations.  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

Our Company generates revenues, income and cash flows primarily from initial, relicensing and continuing royalty fees attributable to our franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from qualified vendor arrangements and other sources. The hotel industry is seasonal in nature. For most hotels, demand is lower from November through February than during the remainder of the year. Our principal source of revenues is franchise fees based on the gross room revenues of our franchised properties. The Company's franchise fee revenues reflect the industry's seasonality and historically have been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second or third quarters.  
  With a focus on hotel franchising instead of ownership, we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business. The fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms and effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts resulting in increased initial fee and relicensing revenue; ongoing royalty fees and procurement services revenues. In addition, our operating results can also be improved through our company-wide efforts related to improving property-level performance. The Company currently estimates, based on its current domestic portfolio of hotels under franchise, a 1% change in revenue per available room ("RevPAR") or rooms under franchise would increase or decrease annual domestic royalty revenues by approximately   $3.0 million   and a 1 basis point change in the Company's effective royalty rate would increase or decrease annual domestic royalties by approximately   $0.7 million  . In addition to these revenues, we also collect marketing and reservation system fees to support centralized marketing and reservation activities for the franchise system. The Company's hotel franchising business currently has relatively low capital expenditure requirements.  
  The principal factors that affect the Company s results are: the number and relative mix of franchised hotel rooms in the various hotel lodging price categories; growth in the number of hotel rooms under franchise; occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise; the effective royalty rate achieved; the level of franchise sales and relicensing activity; and our ability to manage costs. The number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the Company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues or the number of rooms at franchised hotels. The key industry standard for measuring hotel-operating performance is RevPAR, which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized. Our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises. Accordingly, continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results. 
  We are required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation system fees we collect for system-wide marketing and reservation activities. These expenditures, which include advertising costs and costs to maintain our central reservations and property management systems, help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. Greater awareness and preference promotes long-term growth in business delivery to our franchisees and increases the desirability of our brands to hotel owners and developers, which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the Company. 
  Our Company articulates its mission as a commitment to our franchisees  profitability by providing our franchisees with hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise. We have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees  success that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners. 
  We believe that executing our strategic priorities creates value for our shareholders. Our Company focuses on two key goals: 
  Profitable Growth.   Our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels, increasing our system size by selling additional hotel franchises, effective royalty rate improvement and maintaining a disciplined cost structure. We attempt to improve our franchisees  revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery to and/or reduce operating and development costs for our franchisees. These products and services include national marketing campaigns, maintaining a guest loyalty program, a central reservation system, property and yield management systems, quality assurance standards and qualified vendor relationships. We believe that healthy brands, which deliver a compelling return on investment for franchisees, will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises and raise royalty rates over time. We have established multiple brands that meet the needs of many types of guests, and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels. This is intended to ensure that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions. Improving the performance of the hotels under franchise, growing the system through additional franchise sales and improving franchise agreement pricing while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth. 
  Maximizing Financial Returns and Creating Value for Shareholders.   Our capital allocation decisions, including capital structure and uses of capital, are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders. We believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage. Currently, our business does not require significant capital to operate and grow. Therefore, we can maintain a capital structure  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to increase returns to our shareholders primarily through share repurchases, dividends or investing in growth opportunities.  
  Historically, we have returned value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In 1998, our board of directors instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders.  Since the program's inception through   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased   48.7 million   shares (including 33.0 million prior to the two-for-one stock split effected in October 2005) of common stock at a total cost of   $1.3 billion  . Considering the effect of the two-for-one stock split, the Company has repurchased   81.7 million   shares at an average price of   $15.37   per share.  The Company purchased   0.6 million   shares of common stock under the share repurchase program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   at a total cost of   $28.6 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   1.1 million   shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.  We currently believe that our cash flows from operations will support our ability to complete the current repurchase authorization. Upon completion of the current authorization, our board of directors will evaluate the advisability of additional share repurchases. 
  The Company commenced paying quarterly dividends in 2004 and in 2012 the Company elected to pay a special cash dividend totaling approximately $600 million. The Company currently maintains the payment of a quarterly dividend on its common shares outstanding; however, the declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company's board of directors announced a 5% increase to the quarterly cash dividend rate to $0.205 per common share outstanding.  The projected annual dividend in 2016 is $0.82 per common share outstanding.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid cash dividends totaling approximately   $34.7 million  . We expect to continue to pay dividends in the future, subject to declaration by our board of directors as well as future business performance, economic conditions, changes in income tax regulations and other factors including limitations in the Company's credit facility.  Based on the present dividend rate and outstanding share count, we expect that aggregate annual regular dividends for 2016 would be approximately   $46.2 million  . 
  The Company also allocates capital to growth opportunities in business areas that are adjacent or complementary to our core hotel franchising business, which leverage our core competencies and are additive to our franchising business model. The timing and amount of these investments are subject to market and other conditions and include the following:  
  Our board of directors authorized a program which permits us to offer financing, investment and guaranty support to qualified franchisees as well as allows us to acquire and resell real estate to incent franchise development for certain brands in strategic markets. As a result over the next several years, we expect to deploy capital pursuant to this program opportunistically to promote growth of our emerging brands. The amount and timing of the investment in this program will be dependent on market and other conditions and we generally expect to recycle these investments within a five-year period.  
    
  In March 2013, the Company announced the launch of SkyTouch Technology ("SkyTouch"), a new division of the Company that develops and markets cloud-based technology products for the hotel industry. Since inception, the Company has made significant investments in the division, including investments in product development and sales efforts to expand its customer base.   As a result, the division has incurred costs in excess of revenues in each year of its existence and is projected to continue to incur costs in excess of revenues through the year ended December 31, 2016.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the division had an operating loss of approximately $12.7 million.  At this time, the Company believes that its operation of the SkyTouch division beginning in 2017 will not require the same pace of investment as compared to past periods, and as a result, the Company expects that revenues generated by the SkyTouch division will approximate its selling, general and administration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
    
  As with many new technology businesses, the Company from time to time evaluates strategic alternatives with respect to the SkyTouch division. However, no transaction is imminent and there can be no assurance that future evaluation of strategic alternatives, if any, would result in a transaction. 
    
  In August 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of a company that provides software as a service solutions for vacation rental management companies. This business provides central reservations systems, property management systems and integrated software applications including point-of-sale. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The results of this business have been consolidated with the Company since August 2015.  
  Notwithstanding investments in SkyTouch and other alternative growth strategies, the Company expects to continue to return value to its shareholders over time through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.

We believe these investments and strategic priorities, when properly implemented, will enhance our profitability, maximize our financial returns and continue to generate value for our shareholders. The ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below. 
  Results of Operations:   Royalty fees, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") represent key measurements of these value drivers.  These measurements are primarily driven by the operations of our hotel franchise system and therefore, our analysis of the Company's operations is primarily focused on the size, performance and potential growth of the hotel franchise system as well as our variable overhead costs.  Since our hotel franchising activities represent more than 99% of total revenues, our discussion of our results from operations primarily relate to our hotel franchising activities. 
  Refer to MD A heading "Operations Review" for additional analysis of our results. 
  Inflation:   Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our business. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources:   Historically, the Company has generated significant cash flows from operations  .   Since our business does not currently require significant reinvestment of capital, we typically utilize cash in ways that management believes provide the greatest returns to our shareholders which include share repurchases and dividends. However, we may determine to utilize cash for acquisitions and other investments in the future. We believe the Company s cash flow from operations and available financing capacity is sufficient to meet the expected future operating, investing and financing needs of the business. 
  Refer to MD A heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional analysis. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Statement Measurements  
  The Company utilizes certain measures which do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States ("GAAP") when analyzing and discussing its results with the investment community. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP. The Company s calculation of these measurements may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore, comparability may be limited. We have included a reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measurement below as well as our reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures. 
  Hotel Franchising Revenues:   The Company utilizes hotel franchising revenues, which exclude revenues from marketing and reservation system activities, the SkyTouch Technology division, a recently acquired operation that provides software as a service solutions to vacation rental management companies, and revenue generated from the ownership of an office building that is leased to a third-party, rather than total revenues when analyzing the performance of the business. Marketing and reservation activities are excluded from hotel franchising revenues since the Company is contractually required by its franchise agreements to use the fees collected for marketing and reservation activities; as such, no income or loss to the Company is generated. Cumulative marketing and reservation system fees not expended are recorded as a liability in the Company s financial statements and are carried over to the next year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements. Cumulative marketing and reservation expenditures incurred in excess of fees collected for marketing and reservation activities are deferred and recorded as an asset in the Company s financial statements and recovered in future periods. SkyTouch is a division of the Company that develops and markets cloud-based technology products, including inventory management, pricing and connectivity to third party channels, to hoteliers not under franchise agreements with the Company.  SkyTouch and our vacation rental technology solutions provider operations are excluded from hotel franchising revenues since those operations do not reflect the Company's core hotel franchising business but represent adjacent, complementary lines of business. This non-GAAP measure is a commonly used measure of performance in our industry and facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors.

Results of Operations 
  The Company recorded income before income taxes of   $70.2 million   for the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $7.9 million  , or   13%   increase from the same period of the prior year.  The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflects a   $4.8 million   increase in operating income, a   $0.5 million   increase in interest income, an increase of   $2.1 million   in other gains and losses, and a   $0.8 million   increase in equity in income of affiliates, partially offset by a   $0.3 million   increase in interest expense.  
  Operating income increased   $4.8 million   primarily due to a   $7.5 million   or   7%   increase in the Company's hotel franchising revenues, a $0.4 million gain on sale of assets, and an increase of $1.0 million in non-hotel franchising revenues, offset by a   $4.2 million   or   14%   increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses.  The key drivers of these fluctuations are described in more detail below. 
  Hotel Franchising Revenues 
  Hotel franchising revenues were   $113.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $105.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $7.5 million   or   7%  . The increase in hotel franchising revenues is primarily due to a   $6.2 million   or   7%   increase in royalty revenues and a   $1.3 million   or   21%   increase in procurement services revenues.   
  Royalty Fees 
  Domestic royalty fees for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $6.0 million   to   $90.7 million  , an increase of   7%   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in royalties is primarily attributable to a   4.5%   increase in RevPAR and an increase in the effective royalty rate.  System-wide RevPAR increased due to a   3.4%   increase in average daily rates, accompanied by a   70   basis point increase in occupancy rates.  The Company's effective royalty rate for the domestic hotel system increased from   4.27%   for the   three months ended September 30,     2015   to   4.39%   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016  .  The increase in the effective royalty rate is attributable to improved royalty rate pricing on recently executed domestic franchise agreements as well as annual contractual royalty rate increases contained in existing franchise agreements.   
  A summary of the Company's domestic franchised hotels operating information is as follows:

  *Operating statistics exclude Cambria hotel   suites since the operating statistics are not representative of a stabilized brand which the Company defines as having at least 25 units open and operating for a twelve month period. 
  The number of domestic rooms on-line   increased   by   0.3%   to   398,207   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   396,932   as of   September 30, 2015  .  The total number of domestic hotels on-line   increased   by   0.9%   to   5,275   as of   September 30, 2016  , from

5,226   as of   September 30, 2015  . Our unit growth has outpaced the growth in our rooms primarily due to the Company's multi-year strategy to rejuvenate the Comfort family of brands by terminating or repositioning under-performing hotels that no longer meet the Comfort brand standards.  Hotels terminated from the Comfort brand family may be repositioned to a more suitable brand within the Company's family of brands or exit our franchise system.  As a result of this strategy our unit growth has been driven primarily by brands with lower average room counts than the Comfort family of brands.  A summary of domestic hotels and rooms on-line at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   by brand is as follows:  

Domestic hotels open and operating   increased   by   2   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a decrease of   4   domestic hotels open and operating during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Gross domestic franchise additions   decreased   from   68   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   49   for the same period of   2016  . New construction hotels represented   10   of the gross domestic additions during both the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  Gross domestic additions for conversion hotels during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   19   units to   39   from   58   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The timing of conversion hotel openings are impacted by various factors including the complexity of the property improvement plans required to be completed prior to opening but typically open within three to four months after the execution of a franchise agreement.  
    
  Net domestic terminations   decreased   from   72   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   47   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  International royalties   increased     $0.2 million   or   3.8%   from   $5.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a   3.3%   increase in the number of rooms available.  International rooms increased by   3,520   from   107,425   as of   September 30, 2015   to   110,945   as of   September 30, 2016  , and the total number of international hotels   decreased   by   9   from   1,153   as of   September 30, 2015   to   1,144   as of   September 30, 2016  .  International rooms grew 3.3% despite a decline in the number of hotels open and operating primarily due to a focus on new entrants with higher per unit room counts than currently in the Company's international system.   
  Initial Franchise and Relicensing Fees 
  Domestic initial franchise fee revenue, included in the initial franchise and relicensing fees caption on the Company's statements of income, generated from executed franchise agreements   decreased     $0.1 million   to   $2.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $2.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Domestic initial fee revenue   decreased   approximately   5%   despite a   25%     increase   in executed franchise agreements primarily due to increased incentives provided in the current quarter when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and a decrease in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the   third   quarter of   2016   related to franchise agreements executed in prior periods compared to the same period of the prior year.  Executed franchise agreements   increased   from   129   franchise agreements, representing 9,454 rooms, executed in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   161   franchise agreements, representing 11,600 rooms executed in the   third   quarter of   2016  . Revenues associated with agreements including incentives are deferred and recognized when the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated, whichever comes first.

During the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   43   of the executed agreements were for new construction hotel franchises representing 3,003 rooms compared to   38   contracts representing 2,589 rooms for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Conversion hotel executed franchise agreements totaled   118   representing 8,597 rooms for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   91   agreements representing 6,865 rooms for the same period a year ago.  
  A summary of executed domestic franchise agreements by brand for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:  

Relicensing fees include fees charged to the new owners of a franchised property whenever an ownership change occurs and the property remains in the franchise system as well as fees required to renew expiring franchise contracts. Domestic relicensing contracts   decreased     4%   from   109   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   105   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Renewals of expired contracts   decreased   by   1   from   10   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   9   during the current period.  Domestic relicensing and renewal revenues   increased     9%   from   $3.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $3.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , due to an increase in the average fees per deal, partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of relicensing and renewal contracts signed in the current year.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   649   franchised hotels with   50,953   rooms under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development in its domestic system as compared to   540   hotels and   41,776   rooms at   September 30, 2015  . The number of new construction franchised hotels in the Company's domestic pipeline   increased     25%   to   422   at   September 30, 2016   from   337   at   September 30, 2015  .  The growth in the number of new construction hotels in the domestic pipeline reflects the 9% and 79% increase in new construction franchise agreements executed in 2015 and 2014, respectively, as well as the 10% increase in agreements executed year to date in 2016.  New construction hotels typically average 18 to 36 months to open after the franchise agreement is executed.  The number of conversion franchised hotels in the Company's domestic pipeline   increased   by   24   hotels or   12%   from   203   hotels at   September 30, 2015   to   227   hotels at   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in the number of conversion franchise hotels in the domestic pipeline primarily reflects a 30% increase in conversion franchise agreements sold in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as conversion hotels typically open three to four months after the execution of a franchise agreement.  The Company had an additional   96   franchised hotels with   10,464   rooms under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development in its international system as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   98   hotels and   10,108   rooms at   September 30, 2015  .  While the Company's hotel pipeline provides a strong platform for growth, a hotel in the pipeline does not always result in an open and operating hotel due to various factors.

A summary of the domestic franchised hotels pipeline, which includes hotels under construction, awaiting conversion and approved for development, at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   by brand is as follows:  

Procurement Services:   Revenues   increased     $1.3 million   or   21%   from   $6.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $7.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in revenues primarily reflects the implementation of new brand programs as well as an increase in the volume of business transacted with existing and new qualified vendors and strategic alliance partners.   
  Other Income:   Revenue increased   $0.9 million   from the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in other income is primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in revenues related to the August 2015 acquisition of a technology solutions provider to vacation rental management companies, as well as a $0.2 million increase in support and consulting fees earned by our SkyTouch operations.   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:   The cost to operate the business is reflected in SG A on the consolidated statements of income. SG A expenses were   $34.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which   increased     $4.2 million   from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
  SG A expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include approximately   $6.7 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively, related to the Company's SkyTouch and vacation rental divisions, and expenses related to operations of an office building leased to a third party.  Excluding SG A expenses for non-hotel franchising divisions, SG A for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $3.2 million   or   13%   to   $27.6 million   in the current year primarily due to increased costs related to increases in franchise support activities and a $2.0 million increase mark-to-market expense related to changes in the fair value of investments held in the Company's deferred compensation plans incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period of the prior year.  
  Marketing and Reservation System  : The Company's franchise agreements require the payment of franchise fees, which include marketing and reservation system fees. The fees, which are primarily based on a percentage of the franchisees' gross room revenues, are used exclusively by the Company for expenses associated with providing franchise services such as central reservation systems, national marketing and media advertising. The Company is contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements; as such, no net income or loss to the Company is generated. Cumulative marketing and reservation fees not expended are deferred and recorded as a liability in the Company's financial statements and carried over to the next year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements. Conversely, cumulative marketing and reservation expenditures incurred in excess of fees billed for marketing and reservation activities are deferred and recorded as an asset in the Company's financial statements and recovered in future periods.

Total marketing and reservation system revenues   increased     13%   from   $134.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $152.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in revenues was primarily due to recognition of  improved system fees resulting from RevPAR increases, increases in reservation delivery commissions and increasing revenues from the Choice Privileges loyalty program resulting from the growth in program membership, and increases in the average daily rate.  Marketing and reservation system revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   were impacted by the deferral of $8.4 million of revenues.  No revenues were deferred in the third quarter of 2016.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , cumulative marketing and reservation system expenses exceeded fees billed by   $15.3 million  , compared to cumulative marketing and reservation system fees billed exceeding expenses by   $30.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The deficit and excess are reflected as an other long-term asset and liability, respectively in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Gain on sale of assets, net:    The Company purchases real estate as part of its program to incent franchise development in strategic markets or to pursue hotel development through joint ventures.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold properties to franchise developers for a net gain of $0.4 million, pursuant to this program.   
  Other Gains (losses)  :  Other gains (losses) increased   $2.1 million   from a loss of $  1.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to gain of $  0.7 million   in the same period of the current year, primarily due to an increase in gains due to the fluctuations in the fair value of investments held in the Company's non-qualified employee benefit plans of $1.8 million, and a $0.3 million loss related to the Company's refinancing of its revolving credit facility which was recognized in 2015. 
  Equity in Net (Income) Loss of Affiliates:    The Company recorded income of   $1.2 million   from its unconsolidated joint ventures for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to income of   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $0.8 million   increase in income is primarily attributable to the results of operations during the ramp up period of operations for several recently opened or acquired hotel projects owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. These investments relate to the Company's program to offer equity support to qualified franchisees to develop and operate Cambria hotels   suites in strategic markets. 
  Income Taxes  :  The effective income tax rates for continuing operations were   32.2%   and   33.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. The effective income tax rates for continuing operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% due to the impact of foreign operations, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was also impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The adoption resulted in a   $0.7 million   tax benefit for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine-Month Periods Ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015    
    
  Summarized financial results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:  

Results of Operations 
  The Company recorded income before income taxes of   $156.2 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $10.0 million  , or   7%     increase   from the same period of the prior year. The   increase   in income before income taxes primarily reflects a   $8.3 million     increase   in operating income, as well as a   $0.8 million   increase in other gains, a   $1.5 million   increase in interest income, and an decrease in net loss of affiliates of   $0.8 million  , partially offset by a   $1.4 million     increase   in interest expense. 
  Operating income   increased     $8.3 million   as the Company's hotel franchising revenues   increased   by   $17.6 million   or   6%   partially offset by   increased   SG A expenses of   $13.8 million   or   14%  .  The key drivers of these fluctuations are described in more detail below. 
    
  Hotel Franchising Revenues    
  Hotel franchising revenues were   $297.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $280.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   6%     increase  . The   increase   in hotel franchising revenues is primarily due to a   $13.6 million   or   6%     increase   in royalty revenues and a   $4.1 million   or   21%     increase   in procurement services revenues, partially offset by a   $0.6 million   or   3%     decrease   in initial franchising and relicensing revenues.   
    
  Royalty Fees 
  Domestic royalty fees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $14.0 million   to   $232.3 million  , a   6%     increase   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in royalties is attributable to a   3.4%     increase   in RevPAR and   an increase   in the effective royalty rate.  System-wide RevPAR   increased   due to a   3%     increase   in average daily rates accompanied by a   20   basis point   increase   in occupancy rates. The effective royalty rate   increased   to   4.39%   for the   nine months

     Table of Contents  

ended September 30,   2016  , compared to   4.28%   for the prior year period.  The   increase   in the effective royalty rate is attributable to improved royalty rate pricing on recently executed domestic franchise agreements as well as annual contractual royalty rate increases contained in existing franchise agreements.   
  A summary of the Company's domestic franchised hotels operating information is as follows:  

___________________ 
  *Operating statistics exclude Cambria hotel   suites since the operating statistics are not representative of a stabilized brand which the Company defines as having at least 25 units open and operating for a twelve month period. 
  Domestic hotels open and operating   decreased   by 1 hotel during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   an increase   of   5   domestic hotels open and operating during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Gross domestic franchise additions   decreased   from   198   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   180   for the same period of   2016  . New construction hotels represented   33   of the gross domestic additions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   43   new construction hotel openings in the same period of the prior year.  The   decrease   in new construction openings reflects the variability in timings of hotel openings from period to period.  New construction hotels typically average 18 to 36 months to open after the franchise agreement is executed.  Gross domestic additions for conversion hotels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   8   units to   147   from   155   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The timing of conversion hotel openings are impacted by various factors including the complexity of the property improvement plans required to be completed prior to opening but typically open within three to four months after the execution of the franchise agreement. 
  Net domestic franchise terminations   decreased   from   193   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   181   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  International royalties declined by   $0.4 million   or   3%   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $14.9 million   for the same period of   2016  .  International rooms open and operating   increased     3%   to   110,945   as of   September 30, 2016   from   107,425   as of   September 30, 2015  .  Despite the increase in international rooms available, royalties declined as a result of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and RevPAR performance in the countries in which we operate. The total number of international hotels   decreased     0.8%   from   1,153   as of   September 30, 2015   to   1,144   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Initial Franchise and Relicensing Fees 
  Domestic initial fee revenue, included in the initial franchise and relicensing fees caption on the Company's statements of income, generated from executed franchise agreements   decreased     $1.3 million   to   $8.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $9.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Domestic initial fee revenue   decreased   approximately   13%   despite a 3% increase in executed franchise agreements primarily due to a decrease in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the first nine months of 2016 related to franchise agreements executed in prior periods and an increase in franchise incentives in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  Executed franchise agreements   increased   from   367   franchise agreements, representing 27,585 rooms, executed in the   nine   months ended

September 30, 2015  , to   378   franchise agreements, representing 29,976 rooms executed in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Revenues associated with agreements including incentives are deferred and recognized when the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated, whichever comes first.   
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   100   of the executed agreements were for new construction hotel franchises representing 8,041 rooms, compared to   91   contracts representing 6,771 rooms for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Conversion hotel executed franchise agreements totaled   278   representing 21,935 rooms for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   276   agreements representing 20,814 rooms for the same period a year ago.    
  A summary of executed domestic franchise agreements by brand for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:  

Relicensing fees include fees charged to the new owners of a franchised property whenever an ownership change occurs and the property remains in the franchise system as well as fees required to renew expiring franchise contracts. Domestic relicensing contracts   increased     7%   from   283   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   304   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Renewals of expired contracts   increased     14%   from   21   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   24   in the current period.  As a result of the increase in relicensing and renewal contracts, domestic relicensing and renewal revenues   increased     $0.9 million   or   11%   from   $7.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $8.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Procurement Services:   Revenues   increased     $4.1 million   or   21%   from   $19.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $23.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in revenues primarily reflects the implementation of new programs as well as an increased volume of business transacted with qualified vendors and strategic alliance partners. 
    
  Other Income:   Revenue   increased     $4.5 million   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $16.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in other income is primarily due to $0.6 million increase in support and consulting fees earned by the Company's SkyTouch division, and $3.5 million in revenues related to the Company's technology solutions provider to vacation rental management companies acquired in August 2015.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:   The cost to operate the business is reflected in SG A on the consolidated statements of income. SG A expenses were   $109.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $13.8 million   or   14%   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
  SG A expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 include approximately   $20.4 million   and   $16.1 million  , respectively, related to the Company's SkyTouch and vacation rental divisions, and expenses related to operations of an office building leased to a third party. Excluding the SG A expenses for non-hotel franchising divisions, SG A for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $9.5 million   or   12%   to   $89.1 million   in the current year primarily due to a $2.6

million increase in employee termination benefits, a $2.4 million increase in expenses related to the fluctuation of the fair market value of investments held in the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans, as well as increased costs related to franchise support activities.  
  Marketing and Reservation System  :  The Company's franchise agreements require the payment of franchise fees, which include marketing and reservation system fees. The fees, which are primarily based on a percentage of the franchisees' gross room revenues, are used exclusively by the Company for expenses associated with providing franchise services such as central reservation systems, national marketing and media advertising. The Company is contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements; as such, no net income or loss to the Company is generated. Cumulative marketing and reservation fees not expended are deferred and recorded as a liability in the Company's financial statements and carried over to the next year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements. Conversely, cumulative marketing and reservation expenditures incurred in excess of fees billed for marketing and reservation activities are deferred and recorded as an asset in the Company's financial statements and recovered in future periods.  
  Total marketing and reservation system revenues   increased     13%   from   $366.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $412.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Marketing and reservation system revenues reflect the recognition of $30.7 million of previously deferred revenues in 2016 compared to $0.2 million in the prior year.  The increase in the recognition of these revenues was primarily due to a change in the Company's expiration policy for the Choice Privileges membership program.  In addition, revenues increased due to improved system fees resulting from RevPAR increases and increasing revenues from the Choice Privileges loyalty program, resulting from the growth in program membership and increase in average daily rate.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , cumulative marketing and reservation system expenses exceeded fees billed by   $15.3 million  , compared to cumulative marketing and reservation system fees billed exceeding expenses by   $30.7 million  , as of December 31, 2015.  The deficit and excess are reflected as an other long-term asset and liability, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Gain on sale of assets, net:    The Company purchases real estate as part of its program to incent franchise development in strategic markets or to pursue hotel development through joint ventures.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold properties to franchise developers for a net gain of $0.4 million pursuant to this program.  
  Other Gains  :  Other gains increased from a gain of   $0.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to a gain of   $1.0 million   for same period of the current year, primarily due to $2.1 million of gains resulting from fluctuations in the fair value of investments held in the Company's non-qualified employee benefit plans, partially offset by a nonrecurring $1.5 million gain from the sale of the Company's interest in an unconsolidated joint venture recognized in 2015. 
  Equity in Net (Income) Loss of Affiliates:    The Company recorded a loss of   $0.3 million   from its unconsolidated joint ventures for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a loss of   $1.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The losses are primarily attributable to the results of operations during the ramp up period of operations for several recently opened or acquired hotel projects owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. These investments primarily relate to the Company's program to offer equity support to qualified franchisees to develop and operate Cambria hotels   suites in strategic markets. 
    
  Income Taxes:   The effective income tax rates for income from continuing operations were   31.1%   and   32.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective income tax rates for continuing operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% due to the impact of foreign operations, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective income tax rates for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was also impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The adoption resulted in a   $2.1 million   tax benefit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was further reduced by the settlement of unrecognized tax positions.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Operating Activities  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net cash provided by operating activities totaled   $88.4 million   and   $103.7 million  , respectively.  Operating cash flows declined   $15.2 million   primarily due to a   $44.1 million   decrease in cash flows from marketing and reservation activities and the timing of working capital items.  The declines were partially offset by a

$47.9 million   increase in deferred revenue and a   $5.9 million   decline in net disbursements to franchisees for property improvements and other purposes utilizing forgivable promissory notes.   
  Net cash used by marketing and reservation activities totaled   $25.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net cash provided of   $18.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decline in cash provided by marketing and reservation activities primarily reflects a one-time deferral of revenue related to a change in the Company's expiration policy for the Company's loyalty program.  Additionally, the Company expanded its information technology workforce in 2015 to support improvements to the Company's various property management and central reservation technologies that are designed to deliver guests to our franchised hotels.  
  In conjunction with brand and development programs, the Company provides financing to franchisees for property improvements and other purposes in the form of forgivable notes receivable. If the franchisee remains in the system in good standing over the term of the promissory note, the Company forgives the outstanding principal balance and related interest. Since these forgivable notes are predominantly forgiven ratably over the term of the promissory note rather than repaid, the Company classifies the related issuance and collections of these notes as operating activities. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's net advances for these purposes totaled   $15.1 million   and   $21.0 million  , respectively.  The timing and amount of these cash flows is dependent on various factors including the implementation of various development and brand incentive programs, the level of franchise sales and the timing of hotel openings. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had commitments to extend an additional   $150.3 million   for these purposes provided certain conditions are met by its franchisees, of which   $83.7 million   is expected to be advanced in the next twelve months.  
  Investing Activities  
  Cash utilized for investing activities totaled   $66.0 million   and   $63.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase in cash utilized for investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily reflects the following items: 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , capital expenditures totaled   $17.6 million   and   $21.8 million  , respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures from 2015 primarily reflects decreased spending on upgrades of our central reservation and yield management systems as well as purchases of technology hardware.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company completed three acquisitions of real estate as part of a program to incent franchise development in strategic markets for certain brands.  The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was $25.8 million consisting of   $25.6 million   cash (of which $0.3 million was paid as a deposit in the fourth quarter of 2015) with an additional   $0.2 million   of current liabilities assumed.  In addition, the Company incurred   $0.5 million   in acquisition related costs, which have been expensed in the period. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company invested   $24.2 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively, in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, the Company received distributions from these joint ventures totaling $3.7 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company's investment in these joint ventures primarily relate to ventures that either support the Company's efforts to increase business delivery to its franchisees or promote growth of our emerging brands. 
    
  The Company provides financing to franchisees for hotel development efforts and other purposes in the form of notes receivables.  These loans bear interest and are expected to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the loan arrangements.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company advanced and received repayments totaling   $20.3 million   and   $11.0 million   for these purposes, respectively. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company advanced   $25.3 million   and received   $3.7 million   in disbursements related to hotel development efforts. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had commitments to extend an additional $28.0 million for these purposes within the next twelve months provided certain conditions are met by its franchisees.  
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company realized proceeds from the sale of real estate and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture related to the development of the Cambria hotel   suites brand totaling $8.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively.   
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company completed the acquisition of a company that provides software as a service solutions for vacation rental management companies.  The total consideration was $23.6 million, which consisted of cash paid, net of cash acquired of $13.3 million, deferred purchase price payable of $6.8 million and liabilities assumed of $3.6 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid $1.3 million of the deferred purchase price.

From time to time, our board of directors authorizes specific transactions and general programs which permit us to provide financing, investment and guarantees and similar credit support to qualified franchisees, as well as to acquire and resell real estate to incent franchise development.  Since 2006, we have engaged in these financial support activities to encourage acceleration of the growth of our Cambria hotel   suites brand, primarily in strategic markets and locations. Over the next three to five years, depending on market and other conditions, we expect to continue to deploy capital in support of this brand and expect our investment to range between $250 million to $350 million over that time period.  The annual pace of future financial support activities will depend upon market and other conditions including among others, our franchise sales results, the environment for new construction hotel development and the hotel lending environment. Our support of the Cambria brand s growth is expected to be primarily in the form of joint venture investments, forgivable key money loans, senior mortgage loans, development loans, mezzanine lending, and through the operation of a land-banking program. With respect to our lending and joint venture investments, we generally expect to recycle these loans and investments within a five year period.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately $181.1 million outstanding pursuant to these financial support activities.  
    
  Financing Activities  
  Financing cash flows relate primarily to the Company's borrowings, open market treasury stock repurchases, acquisition of shares in connection with the exercise or vesting of equity awards, and dividends.

  Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 
  On August 25, 2010, the Company issued unsecured senior notes with a principal amount of $250 million (the "2010 Senior Notes") at a discount of $0.6 million, bearing a coupon of 5.70% with an effective rate of 6.19%. The 2010 Senior Notes will mature on August 28, 2020, with interest on the 2010 Senior Notes to be paid semi-annually on February 28   th    and August 28   th   .

  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  On July 21, 2015, the Company refinanced its existing $350 million senior secured credit facility, comprised of a $200 million revolving credit tranche and a $150 million term loan tranche by entering into a new senior unsecured revolving credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ), with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent. 
    
  The Credit Agreement provides for a $450 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) with an initial maturity date of July 21, 2020, subject to optional one-year extensions that can be requested by the Company prior to each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date of the Revolver. The effectiveness of any such extensions is subject to the  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  

consent of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and certain customary conditions.  On July 5, 2016, the Company exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the Revolver by one year. The new maturity date of the Revolver is July 21, 2021. 
  Up to $35 million of borrowings under the Revolver may be used for alternative currency loans and up to $15 million of borrowings under the Revolver may be used for swing line loans.  
    
  The Revolver is unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries, which are considered restricted subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement.  The subsidiary guarantors currently include all subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the Company's Indenture governing the terms of its 5.75% senior notes due 2022 and its 5.70% senior notes due 2020.  If the Company achieves and maintains an Investment Grade Rating, as defined in the Credit Agreement, then the subsidiary guarantees will at the election of the Company be released and the Revolver will not be guaranteed.    
    
  The Company may at any time prior to the final maturity date increase the amount of the Revolver by up to an additional $150 million to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to being a lender for the additional amount and certain other customary conditions are met.  
    
  The Company currently may elect to have borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 135 to 175 basis points based on the Company s total leverage ratio or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 35 to 75 basis points based on the Company s total leverage ratio. If the Company achieves an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company may elect to use a different, ratings-based, pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  The Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolver, calculated on the basis of the average daily unused amount of the Revolver multiplied by 0.20% per annum.  If the Company achieves an Investment Grade Rating and it elects to use the ratings-based pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement, then the Company will be required to pay a fee on the total commitments under the Revolver, calculated on the basis of the actual daily amount of the commitments under the Revolver (regardless of usage) times a percentage per annum ranging from 0.10% to 0.25% (depending on the Company s senior unsecured long-term debt rating). 
    
  The Credit Agreement requires that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries comply with various covenants, including with respect to restrictions on liens, incurring indebtedness, making investments and effecting mergers and/or asset sales. With respect to dividends, the Company may not declare or make any payment if there is an existing event of default or if the payment would create an event of default. In addition, if the Company s total leverage ratio exceeds 4.0 to 1.0, the Company is generally restricted from paying aggregate dividends in excess of $50 million in any calendar year.  
    
  The Credit Agreement imposes financial maintenance covenants requiring the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 to 1.0.  If the Company achieves and maintains an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company will not need to comply with the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant.  
    
  The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company maintained a total leverage ratio of 3.04x and a consolidated fixed charge ratio of 6.86x and was in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement.   
    
  The proceeds of the Revolver are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, debt repayment, stock repurchases, dividends, investments and other permitted uses set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
  Fixed Rate Collateralized Mortgage 
  On December 30, 2014, a court awarded the Company title to an office building as settlement for a portion of an outstanding loan receivable for which the building was pledged as collateral.  In conjunction with the court award, the Company also assumed the $9.5 million mortgage on the property with a fixed interest rate of 7.26%.  The mortgage which is collateralized by the office building requires monthly payments of principal and interest and matures in December 2020 with a balloon payment due of $6.9 million. At the time of acquisition, the Company determined that the fixed interest rate of 7.26% exceeded market interest rates and therefore the Company increased the carrying value of the debt by $1.2 million to record the debt at fair value. The fair value adjustment will be amortized over the remaining term of the mortgage utilizing the effective interest method.

Economic Development Loans 
  The Company entered into economic development agreements with various governmental entities in conjunction with the relocation of its corporate headquarters in April 2013.  In accordance with these agreements, the governmental entities agreed to advance approximately   $4.4 million   to the Company to offset a portion of the corporate headquarters relocation and tenant improvement costs in consideration of the employment of permanent, full-time employees within the jurisdictions. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had been advanced approximately $3.7 million pursuant to these agreements and expects to receive the remaining $0.7 million over the next several years, subject to annual appropriations by the governmental entities.  These advances bear interest at a rate of   3%   per annum. 
  Repayment of the advances is contingent upon the Company achieving certain performance conditions.  Performance conditions are measured annually on December 31   st    and primarily relate to maintaining certain levels of employment within the various jurisdictions.  If the Company fails to meet an annual performance condition, the Company may be required to repay a portion or all of the advances including accrued interest by April 30   th    following the measurement date. Any outstanding advances at the expiration of the Company's   ten   year corporate headquarters lease in 2023 will be forgiven in full. The advances will be included in long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets until the Company determines that the future performance conditions will be met over the entire term of the agreement and the Company will not be required to repay the advances.  The Company accrues interest on the portion of the advances that it expects to repay. The Company was in compliance with all current performance conditions as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Dividends  
  The Company currently maintains the payment of a quarterly dividend on its common shares outstanding; however, the declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors. In December 2015, the Company's board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate to $0.205 per common share, beginning with the first dividend payable in 2016, representing a 5% increase from previous quarterly declarations.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company paid cash dividends totaling   $34.7 million  .  We expect to continue to pay dividends in the future, subject to the declaration of our board of directors as well as to future business performance, economic conditions, changes in income tax regulations and other factors including limitations in the Company's credit facility.  Based on the present dividend rate and outstanding share count, we expect that aggregate annual regular dividends for 2016 would be approximately   $46.2 million  . 
  Share Repurchases  
  The Company purchased   0.6 million   shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of   $28.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Since the program's inception through   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased   48.7 million   shares (including 33.0 million prior to the two-for-one stock split effected in October 2005) of common stock at a total cost of   $1.3 billion  . Considering the effect of the two-for-one stock split, the Company has repurchased   81.7 million   shares at an average price of   $15.37   per share.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   1.1 million   shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.   
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company redeemed   118,063   shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately   $5.4 million   from employees to satisfy the option exercise price and statutory minimum tax-withholding requirements related to the exercising of stock options and vesting of performance vested restricted stock units and restricted stock grants. These redemptions were outside the share repurchase program.  
  Other items  
  Approximately   $186.6 million   of the Company's cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   pertains to undistributed earnings of the Company's consolidated foreign subsidiaries. Since the Company's intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the foreign subsidiaries, the Company has not provided additional U.S. income taxes on these amounts. While the Company has no intention to utilize these cash and cash equivalents in its domestic operations, any change to this policy would result in the Company incurring additional U.S. income taxes on any amounts utilized domestically.  
  The Company believes that cash flows from operations and available financing capacity are adequate to meet the expected future operating, investing and financing needs of the business.

     Table of Contents  

On October 9, 2012, the Company entered into a limited payment guaranty with regards to a VIE's   $18.0 million   bank loan for the construction of a hotel franchised under one of the Company's brands in the United States.  Under the terms of the limited guaranty, the Company has agreed to guarantee   25%   of the outstanding principal balance for a maximum exposure of $4.5 million and accrued and unpaid interest, as well as any unpaid expenses incurred by the lender.  The limited guaranty shall remain in effect until the maximum amount guaranteed by the Company is paid in full.  In addition to the limited guaranty, the Company entered into an environmental indemnity agreement which indemnifies the lending institution from and against any damages relating to or arising out of possible environmental contamination issues with regards to the property. 
  On September 4, 2015, The Company entered into a limited payment guaranty with regards to a VIE's   $13.3 million   bank loan for the design, development and construction of a new hotel franchised under one of the Company's brands in the United States.  Under the terms of the limited guaranty, the Company has agreed to guarantee a maximum of $1.8 million of the VIE s obligations under the loan.  The limited guaranty shall remain in effect until (i) the VIE s bank loan is paid in full to the lender; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed by the Company is paid in full; or (iii) the Company, through its affiliate, ceases to be a member of the VIE.   
    
  On June 2, 2016, one of the Company s VIEs obtained a   $61.0 million   term loan for purposes of refinancing a   $46.2 million   construction loan. In connection with the refinancing, the Company entered into three limited guarantees. Under the terms of the limited guarantees, the Company has agreed to guarantee a maximum obligation of   $3.3 million   in the aggregate, in addition to a percentage of any operating expenses and capital expenditures not covered by operating revenues and unpaid expenses incurred.   The limited guarantees will remain in effect until the loan is repaid in full or the VIE reaches a specified debt yield for two consecutive quarters under the loan covenants. The maturity date of the VIE's loan is June 2019. 
  The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under the aforementioned limited payment guarantees was remote at     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the United States. We have described below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment or significant estimates in their application. Additional discussion of these policies is included in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We recognize continuing franchise fees, including royalty, marketing and reservations system fees, when earned and realizable from our franchisees. Franchise fees are typically based on a percentage of gross room revenues or the number of hotel rooms of each franchisee. Franchise fees based on a percentage of gross room revenues are recognized in the same period that the underlying gross room revenues are earned by our franchisees. Our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible royalty fees is charged to SG A expense and our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible marketing and reservation system fees is charged to marketing and reservation expenses. 
  Initial franchise and relicensing fees are recognized, in most instances, in the period the related franchise agreement is executed because the initial franchise and relicensing fees are non-refundable and the Company is not required to provide initial services to the franchisee prior to hotel opening. We defer the initial franchise and relicensing fee revenue related to franchise agreements which include incentives until the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated, whichever occurs first. 
  The Company recognizes procurement services revenues from qualified vendors when the services are performed or the product delivered, evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We defer the recognition of procurement services revenues related to certain upfront fees and recognize them over a period corresponding to the Company s estimate of the life of the arrangement. 
  Marketing and Reservation Revenues and Expenses 
  The Company's franchise agreements require the payment of certain marketing and reservation system fees, which are used exclusively by the Company for expenses associated with providing franchise services such as national marketing, media advertising, central reservation systems and technology services. The Company is contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements; as such, no net income or loss to the Company is generated. In accordance with our contracts, we include in marketing and reservation  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

expenses an allocation of costs for certain activities, such as human resources, facilities, legal and accounting, required to carry out marketing and reservation activities.  
  The Company records marketing and reservation system revenues and expenses on a gross basis since the Company is the primary obligor in the arrangement, maintains the credit risk, establishes the price and nature of the marketing or reservation services and retains discretion in supplier selection. In addition, net advances to and recoveries from the franchise system for marketing and reservation activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities.  
  Marketing and reservation system fees not expended in the current year are recorded as a liability in the Company's balance sheet and are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements or utilized to repay previous advances.  Marketing and reservation expenses incurred in excess of revenues are recorded as an asset in the Company's balance sheet, with a corresponding reduction in costs, and are similarly recovered in subsequent years. Under the terms of the franchise agreements, the Company may advance capital and incur costs as necessary for marketing and reservation activities and recover such advances through future fees. The Company believes that any credit risk associated with cost advances for marketing and reservation system activities is mitigated due to our contractual right to recover these amounts from a large geographically dispersed group of franchisees. However, our ability to recover advances may be adversely impacted by certain factors, including, among others, declines in the ability of our franchisees to generate revenues at properties they franchise from us, lower than expected franchise system growth, an extended period of occupancy or room rate declines or a decline in the number of hotel rooms in our franchise system. If these factors exist it could result in the generation of insufficient funds to recover marketing and reservation advances as well as meet the ongoing marketing and reservation needs of the overall system.  
  The Company evaluates the recoverability of marketing and reservation costs incurred in excess of cumulative marketing and reservation system revenues earned on a periodic basis. The Company will record a reserve when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to recover the cumulative amounts advanced for marketing and reservation activities according to the contractual terms of the franchise agreements. These advances are considered to be unrecoverable if the expected net, undiscounted cash flows from marketing and reservation activities are less than the carrying amount of the asset.   
  Choice Privileges is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. Choice Privileges enables members to earn points based on their spending levels with our franchisees and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners' programs, such as those offered by credit card companies. The points, which we accumulate and track on the members' behalf, may be redeemed for free accommodations or other benefits.  
  We provide Choice Privileges as a marketing program to franchised hotels and collect a percentage of program members' room revenue from franchises to operate the program. Revenues are deferred in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the future redemption obligation. The Company develops an estimate of the eventual redemption rates and point values using various actuarial methods. These judgmental factors determine the required liability attributable to outstanding points. Upon redemption of points, the Company recognizes the previously deferred revenue as well as the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed. Revenues in excess of the estimated future redemption obligation are recognized when earned to reimburse the Company for costs incurred to operate the program, including administrative costs, marketing, promotion and performing member services.   
  Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets 
  The Company evaluates the potential impairment of property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including franchise rights and other definite-lived intangibles, whenever an event or other circumstances indicates that the Company may not be able to recover the carrying value of the asset. When indicators of impairment are present, recoverability is assessed based on net, undiscounted expected cash flows.  If the net, undiscounted expected cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. We estimate the fair value of intangibles and long lived assets primarily using undiscounted cash flow analysis.  Significant management judgment is involved in evaluating indicators of impairment and developing any required projections to test for recoverability or estimate the fair value of an asset. Furthermore, if management uses different projections or if different conditions occur in future periods, future-operating results could be materially impacted. 
  The Company evaluates the impairment of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that the Company may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.   In evaluating these assets for impairment, the Company may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the conclusion is that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then no further  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  

testing is required.  If the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then a two-step impairment test is performed for goodwill. The Company may elect to forego the qualitative assessment and move directly to the two-step impairment test for goodwill and the fair value determination for indefinite-lived intangibles.  The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles using income and market methods.  
  Valuation of Investments in Equity Method Investments 
  The Company evaluates an investment in an equity method investment for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example due to loan defaults, significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating performance, and significant negative industry or economic trends. When there is indication that a loss in value has occurred, the Company evaluates the carrying value compared to the estimated fair value of the investment. Fair value is based upon internally developed discounted cash flow models, third-party appraisals, and if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. If the estimated fair value is less than carrying value, management uses its judgment to determine if the decline in value is other-than-temporary. In determining this, the Company considers factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and extent of the decline, loss of values as a percentage of the cost, financial condition and near-term financial projections, the Company's intent and ability to recover the lost value and current economic conditions. For declines in value that are deemed other-than-temporary, impairments are charged to earnings. 
    
  Loan Loss Reserves 
  The Company segregates its notes receivable for the purposes of evaluating allowances for credit losses between two categories: Mezzanine and Other Notes Receivable and Forgivable Notes Receivable. The Company utilizes the level of security it has in the various notes receivable as its primary credit quality indicator (i.e. senior, subordinated or unsecured) when determining the appropriate allowances for uncollectible loans within these categories. 
  Mezzanine and Other Notes Receivables 
  The Company has provided financing to franchisees in support of the development of properties in strategic markets. The Company expects the owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. The Company estimates the collectability and records an allowance for loss on its mezzanine and other notes receivable when recording the receivables in the Company s financial statements. These estimates are updated quarterly based on available information. 
  The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement. The Company measures loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, the Company establishes a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. The Company applies its loan impairment policy individually to all mezzanine and other notes receivable in the portfolio and does not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. For impaired loans, the Company recognizes interest income on a cash basis. If it is likely that a loan will not be collected based on financial or other business indicators it is the Company s policy to charge off these loans to SG A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the quarter when it is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of impaired loans are recorded as a reduction of SG A expenses in the quarter received. 
  The Company assesses the collectability of its senior notes receivable by comparing the market value of the underlying assets to the carrying value of the outstanding notes. In addition, the Company evaluates the property s operating performance, the borrower s compliance with the terms of the loan and franchise agreements, and all related personal guarantees that have been provided by the borrower. For subordinated or unsecured receivables, the Company assesses the property s operating performance, the subordinated equity available to the Company, the borrower s compliance with the terms of the loan and franchise agreements, and the related personal guarantees that have been provided by the borrower. 
  The Company considers loans to be past due and in default when payments are not made when due. Although the Company considers loans to be in default if payments are not received on the due date, the Company does not suspend the accrual of interest until those payments are more than 30 days past due. The Company applies payments received for loans on non-accrual status first to interest and then principal. The Company does not resume interest accrual until all delinquent payments are received. 
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

Forgivable Notes Receivable 
  In conjunction with brand and development programs, the Company may provide financing to franchisees for property improvements and other purposes in the form of forgivable promissory notes which bear interest at market rates. Under these promissory notes, the franchisee promises to repay the principal balance together with interest upon maturity unless certain conditions are met throughout the term of the promissory note. The principal balance and related interest are forgiven ratably over the term of the promissory note if the franchisee remains in the system in good standing. If during the term of the promissory note, the franchisee exits our franchise system or is not operating their franchise in accordance with our quality or credit standards, the Company may declare a default under the promissory note and commence collection efforts with respect to the full amount of the then-current outstanding principal and interest.  
  In accordance with the terms of the promissory notes, the initial principal balance and related interest are ratably reduced over the term of the loan on each anniversary date until the outstanding amounts are reduced to zero as long as the franchisee remains within the franchise system and operates in accordance with our quality and brand standards. As a result, the amounts recorded as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheet are also ratably reduced since the amounts forgiven no longer represent probable future economic benefits to the Company. The Company records the reduction of its recorded assets through amortization and marketing and reservation expense on its consolidated statements of income. Since these forgivable promissory notes receivable are predominately forgiven ratably over the term of the promissory note rather than repaid, the Company classifies the issuance and collection of these notes receivable as operating activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows.  
  The Company fully reserves all defaulted notes in addition to recording a reserve on the estimated uncollectible portion of the remaining notes. For those notes not in default, the Company calculates an allowance for losses and determines the ultimate collectibility on these forgivable notes based on the historical default rates for those unsecured notes that are not forgiven but are required to be repaid. The Company records bad debt expense in SG A and marketing and reservation system expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the quarter when the note is deemed uncollectible. 
  Stock Compensation 
  The Company s policy is to recognize compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Compensation expense related to the fair value of share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on an estimate of those awards that will ultimately vest. The Company estimates the share-based compensation expense for awards that will ultimately vest upon inception of the grant and adjusts the estimate of share-based compensation for those awards with performance and/or service requirements that will not be satisfied so that compensation cost is recognized only for awards that ultimately vest. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently reinvested in operations outside the U.S. If management s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.  
  With respect to uncertain income tax positions, a tax liability is recorded in full when management determines that the position does not meet the more likely than not threshold of being sustained on examination. A tax liability may also be recognized for a position that meets the more likely than not threshold, based upon management s assessment of the position s probable settlement value. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. 
  Several factors could cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to differ materially from those expressed in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements.  Such risks include, but are not limited to, changes to general, domestic and foreign economic conditions;  changes in law and regulation applicable to the lodging and franchising industries foreign currency fluctuations; operating risks common in the lodging and franchising industries; changes to the desirability of our brands as viewed by hotel operators and customers; changes to the terms or termination of our contracts with franchisees and our relationships with our franchisees; our ability to keep pace with improvements in technology utilized for marketing and reservations systems and other operating systems; the commercial acceptance of our SkyTouch division's products and services; our ability to grow our franchise system; exposures to risks relating to development activities; fluctuations in the supply and demand for hotels rooms; our ability to realize anticipated benefits of acquired businesses; the level of acceptance of alternative growth strategies we may implement; cyber security and data breach risks; operating risks associated with international operations; the outcome of litigation; and our ability to effectively manage our indebtedness.  These and other risk factors are discussed in detail in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2016.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies on the Company's foreign investments and operations. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through the monitoring of its available financing alternatives including in certain circumstances the use of derivative financial instruments. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our non-qualified retirement savings plan investments in debt securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of   $18.9 million   and   $17.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively which we account for as trading securities. The Company will continue to monitor the exposure in these areas and make the appropriate adjustments as market conditions dictate.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $212.0 million   of variable interest rate debt instruments outstanding at an effective rate of   2.03%  . A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company s effective interest rate from   September 30, 2016   levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by   $0.4 million  . The Company expects to refinance its fixed and variable long-term debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturities. 
  The Company does not presently have any derivative financial instruments.  

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
       
  Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company has a disclosure review committee whose membership includes the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), among others. The disclosure review committee s procedures are considered by the CEO and CFO in performing their evaluations of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and in assessing the accuracy and completeness of the Company s disclosures. 
  Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report as required by Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.   
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
     The Company is not a party to any litigation other than litigation in the ordinary course of business.  The Company's management and legal counsel do not expect that the ultimate outcome of any of its currently ongoing legal proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed on February 29, 2016. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.

  CERTIFICATION  
  I, Stephen P. Joyce, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Choice Hotels International, Inc.;  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report;  
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared;  
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this quarterly report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report based on such evaluation; and  
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this quarterly report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;  
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
