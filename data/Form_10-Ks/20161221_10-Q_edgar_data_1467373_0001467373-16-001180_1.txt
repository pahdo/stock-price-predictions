1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. We use the terms  Accenture,   we,  the  Company  and  our  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   August 31, 2016   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   October 28, 2016  . 
  The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the   three months ended November 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   August 31, 2017  . 
  Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled Services 
  As of   November 30, 2016   and   August 31, 2016  , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were     $79,281   and   $79,440  , respectively.    
  Accumulated Depreciation 
  As of   November 30, 2016   and   August 31, 2016  , total accumulated depreciation was   $1,752,468   and   $1,730,025  , respectively.    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 
  On September 1, 2016,   the Company   early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The standard clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on   the Company s   cash flows statement and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. 
  The primary impact of the adoption of the ASU on   the Company s   Consolidated Financial Statements was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which reduced income tax expense by   $30,598   for the   three months ended November 30, 2016  .   The Company   elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.   The Company   also elected to retrospectively apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits for all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities of   $31,952   for the three months ended November 30, 2015. The presentation requirement for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in   the Company s   consolidated cash flows statements since these cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  On October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Under current guidance in U.S. GAAP, in the case of depreciable or amortizable assets, the income tax consequences are deferred at the time of the intra-entity transfer and recognized as the assets are depreciated or amortized. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2019, and requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative

catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.   The Company is   assessing the impact of this ASU on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2019, and requires the retrospective method of adoption unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.   The Company is   assessing the impact of this ASU on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2018.   The Company does   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption.   The Company is   assessing the impact of this ASU on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2019.   The Company does   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for   the Company     beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.   The Company   will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.   The Company is   assessing the impact of this ASU on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.

2. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   other,  since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.

              (2) 
    As of   November 30, 2016  ,   $42,555   of net unrealized gains related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months.

4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  
  During the   three months ended November 30, 2016  , the Company completed several individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of   $540,219  , net of cash acquired. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on the Company s operations were not material.    
   
  5. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  Goodwill 
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment were as follows:    

Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.  
  Intangible Assets 
  The Company s definite-lived intangible assets by major asset class were as follows:    

Total amortization related to the Company s intangible assets was   $33,128   and   $27,724   for the   three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   Estimated future amortization related to intangible assets held as of     November 30, 2016   is as follows:

6. MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  Dividends 
  The Company s dividend activity during the   three months ended November 30, 2016   was as follows: 

The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.    
   
  7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders  Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the   three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015  , as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note   3   (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Other Derivatives 
  Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were a net loss of     $138,094   and   $72,977   for the   three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in   Other income (expense), net   in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
  The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:    

The Company utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Company records derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:    

8. RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS 
  On March 18, 2016, Accenture plc s Board of Directors approved an amendment to terminate the Company s U.S. pension plan, effective   May 30, 2016  , for all active and former employees who are no longer accruing benefits in the pension plan (approximately   16,200   people). The amendment also provides for the creation of a separate defined benefit plan with substantially the same terms for approximately   600   active employees who are currently eligible to accrue benefits. The U.S. pension plan is expected to be settled in   12   to   18   months from the termination effective date, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals.  
  The Company s ultimate settlement obligation will depend upon both the nature and timing of participant settlements and prevailing market conditions. Upon settlement, the Company expects to recognize additional expense, consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss that totaled approximately   $467,000   as of   August 31, 2016  , adjusted for the difference between the ultimate settlement obligation and the Company s accrued pension obligation. The Company does not expect the settlement of the U.S. pension plan obligations to have a material impact on its cash position.

9. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company applies an estimated annual effective tax rate to its year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, the Company recognizes taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.    
  The Company s effective tax rates for the   three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015   were   20.4%   and     29.3%  , respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the   three months ended November 30, 2016   was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year taxes and recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-09. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1,  Financial Statements.     
   
  10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Commitments  
  The Company has the right to purchase or may also be required to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of its Avanade Inc. subsidiary ( Avanade ) not owned by the Company at fair value if certain events occur. As of   November 30, 2016   and   August 31, 2016  , the Company has reflected the fair value of   $52,703   and   $54,221  , respectively, related to Avanade s redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    
  Indemnifications and Guarantees 
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.    
  As of   November 30, 2016   and   August 31, 2016  , the Company s aggregate potential liability to its clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately   $607,000   and   $749,000  , respectively, of which all but approximately   $89,000   and   $113,000  , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if the Company is obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.    
  To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.    
  Legal Contingencies 
  As of   November 30, 2016  , the Company or its present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. The Company and/or its personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of its business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as provided below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.    
  On December 8, 2016, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration notified a subsidiary of Accenture that it has opened an investigation to examine the tax treatment of an August 2010 intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property. The tax treatment used in connection with the transfer was based on tax rulings we obtained from the relevant Swiss tax authorities and upon which we relied. The Swiss tax authorities have asserted that in connection with the transfer of the intellectual property, we underpaid income and withholding taxes. If the Swiss tax authorities were to prevail in this matter, taxes could be due, plus interest and possible penalties, which could be material. We strongly disagree with the assertions made and while we intend to cooperate with the Swiss tax authorities, we will vigorously defend our position.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   August 31, 2016  , and with the information under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   August 31, 2016  . 
  We use the terms  Accenture,   we,  the  Company,   our  and  us  in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to    fiscal 2017    means the 12-month period that will end on   August 31, 2017  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
  We use the term  in local currency  so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results  in local currency  are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
   
  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as  may,   will,   should,   likely,   anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   projects,   believes,   estimates,   positioned,   outlook  and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to: 
             
    Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients  businesses and levels of business activity. 
                
    Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. 
                
    If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
                
    The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. 
                
    We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. 
                
    Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. 
                
    Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
                
    Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
                
    Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.

Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 
                
    We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. 
                
    Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks. 
                
    As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks. 
                
    Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations. 
                
    Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others. 
                
    If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected. 
                
    Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. 
                
    If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. 
                
    We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results. 
                
    Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. 
                
    Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. 
                
    We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. 
                
    Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. 
                
    We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders  ownership interest in us. 
     For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   August 31, 2016  . Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Overview 
  Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients  current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.    
  Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.  
  Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   6%   in U.S. dollars and   7%   in local currency compared to the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across most areas of our business. During the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  , revenue growth in local currency was significant in Products and solid in Financial Services and Health   Public Service. Communications, Media   Technology revenue growth in local currency was modest, while Resources had a slight decline. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  . While the business environment remained competitive, we continued to experience pricing improvement in several areas of our business. We use the term  pricing  to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.    
  In our consulting business, net revenues for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   6%   in U.S. dollars and   7%   in local currency compared to the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the     first quarter of fiscal 2017   was led by very significant growth in Products, as well as solid growth in Financial Services, partially offset by a decline in Resources  . We continue to experience growing demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. 
  In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   7%   in both U.S. dollars and   local currency compared to the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was driven by strong growth in Health   Public Service, Products, Financial Services   and Communications, Media   Technology, as well as modest growth in Resources  . We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. 
  As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.   The U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately   1%   lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of   fiscal 2017  , we estimate that our full   fiscal 2017   revenue growth will be approximately   2%   lower in U.S. dollars than in local currency.    
  The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. 
  Utilization for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was   92%  , flat with   the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   and up from   90%   in the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.   We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

of which serve our clients, to approximately   394,000   as of   November 30, 2016  , compared   to approximately   373,000   as of   November 30, 2015  . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was   12%  , down from   16%   in the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   and   13%   in the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases   become effective December 1st of each fiscal year.   We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.    
  Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was   32.1%  , compared with   32.0%   for the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . 
  Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   16.4%   for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   compared with   16.7%   for the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   compared to the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased   50   basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues increased   20   basis points.    
  Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was   15.6%  , compared with   15.2%   for the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  .  
  New Bookings 
  New bookings for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   were   $8.32 billion  , with consulting bookings of   $4.88 billion   and outsourcing bookings of   $3.44 billion  .

  Net Revenues 
  The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   compared to the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  : 
  Operating Groups 
             
    Communications, Media   Technology net revenues increased   4%   in local currency, driven by Media   Entertainment and Electronics   High Tech growth in both North America and Growth Markets. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Communications in Europe, as disruptions in the market continue to impact demand, and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. 
                
    Financial Services net revenues increased   6%   in local currency, driven by growth in both industry groups in Europe. In Banking   Capital Markets, strong growth in Europe and Growth Markets was partially offset by a decline in North America. 
                
    Health   Public Service net revenues increased   5%   in local currency, driven by Public Service in Growth Markets and Europe, as well as Health in North America. 
                
    Products net revenues increased   17%   in local currency, driven by very strong growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail   Travel Services, as well as Life Sciences in North America and Industrial in Europe. 
     
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Resources net revenues decreased   2%   in local currency, as significant growth in Utilities in Europe and Growth Markets was more than offset by declines in Chemicals   Natural Resources and Energy across all geographic regions. We have experienced negative revenue growth in Chemicals   Natural Resources and Energy, principally due to continued challenging market conditions in these industries, and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. 
     Geographic Regions 
             
    North America net revenues increased   6%   in local currency, driven by the United States. 
                
    Europe net revenues increased   7%   in local currency, driven by the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Belgium. 
                
    Growth Markets net revenues increased   10%   in local currency, led by Japan, as well as China and Australia.    
     Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $429 million  , or   6%  , over the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to   85.2%   from   85.6%   during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $392 million  , or   6%  , over the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   84.4%   from   84.8%   during this period.  
  Cost of Services 
  Cost of services for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $372 million  , or   6%  , over the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at   69.7%   during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $335 million  , or   6%  , over the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   67.9%   from   68.0%   during this period. Gross margin for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased to   32.1%   from   32.0%   during this period. 
  Sales and Marketing 
  Sales and marketing expense for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $13 million  , or   1%  , over the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   10.4%   from   10.9%   during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.    
  General and Administrative Costs 
  General and administrative costs for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $44 million  , or   9%  , from the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to   6.0%   from   5.8%   during this period. 
  Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Operating income for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $111 million  , or   9%  , over the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  .   Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue.   The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   compared with the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  :    
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income increased primarily due to higher outsourcing revenue growth. 
                
    Financial Services operating income decreased primarily due to lower outsourcing contract profitability. 
                
    Health   Public Service operating income increased due to higher consulting contract profitability and outsourcing revenue growth. 
                
    Products operating income increased due to significant revenue growth, higher consulting contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. 
                
    Resources operating income decreased due to a decline in consulting revenue and lower contract profitability. 
     Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was   20.4%  , compared with   29.3%   for the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . The lower effective tax rate in the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year taxes and recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of the early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.   For more information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1,  Financial Statements.     
  Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2017 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. The effective tax rate for a quarter can vary outside of the range because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year.    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   $5 million  , or   11%  , from the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  . The increase was due to higher Net income of   $191 million   during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  . 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Diluted earnings per share increased   $0.30   compared with the   first quarter of fiscal 2016  , due to increases of   $0.18   from a lower effective tax rate,   $0.11   from higher revenues and operating results and   $0.02   from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of   $0.01   from higher non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1,  Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   November 30, 2016  , Cash and cash equivalents was   $4.1 billion  , compared with   $4.9 billion   as of   August 31, 2016  . 
  Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:    

_______________  
  Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
  Operating activities:     The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher tax payments during the three months ended November 30, 2015 related to withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of the Company s U.S. subsidiaries. 
  Investing activities:   The   $17 million   decrease in cash used was due to decreased spending on business acquisitions and investments and property and equipment. 
  Financing activities:   The   $33 million   decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in the net purchases of shares, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note   6   (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders  Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1,  Financial Statements.     
  We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.    
  Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.    
  Borrowing Facilities 
  As of   November 30, 2016  , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:

Share Purchases and Redemptions 
  The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
  Our share purchase activity during the   three months ended November 30, 2016   was as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. 
              (2) 
    During the   three months ended November 30, 2016  , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. 
     We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of   fiscal 2017  . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. 
  Other Share Redemptions 
  During the   three months ended November 30, 2016  , we issued   403,340   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the  registration statement ). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
  For a complete description of all share purchase and redemption activity for the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  , see Part II, Item 2,  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.  
  To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1,  Financial Statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 
  On September 1, 2016,   we   early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The standard clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on   our   cash flows statement and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. 
  The primary impact of the adoption of the ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which reduced income tax expense by   $31 million   for the   three months ended November 30, 2016  .   We   elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.   We   also elected to retrospectively apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits for all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities of   $32 million   for the three months ended November 30, 2015. The presentation requirement for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in   our   consolidated cash flows statements since these cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  On October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Under current guidance in U.S. GAAP, in the case of depreciable or amortizable assets, the income tax consequences are deferred at the time of the intra-entity transfer and recognized as the assets are depreciated or amortized. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2019, and requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.   We are   assessing the impact of this ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2019, and requires the retrospective method of adoption unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.     We are   assessing the impact of this ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2018.   We do   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption.   We are   assessing the impact of this ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2019.   We do   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Table of Contents  

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.   We   will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.   We are   assessing the impact of this ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  During the   three months ended November 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   August 31, 2016  . For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of   August 31, 2016  , see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   August 31, 2016  . 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares and Class X Ordinary Shares 
  The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and redemptions of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  . 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Average price paid per share reflects the total cash outlay for the period, divided by the number of shares acquired, including those acquired by purchase or redemption for cash and any acquired by means of employee forfeiture. 
              (2) 
    Since   August 2001  , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  , we purchased   3,895,212   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of   $453 million  . The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. 
              (3) 
    As of   November 30, 2016  , our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was   $4,899 million  , which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since   August 2001   and as of   November 30, 2016  , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of   $30,100 million   for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. 
              (4) 
    During the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  , Accenture purchased   868,630   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares 
  The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  . We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture. Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share. 

_______________ 
           (1)

In addition, during the   first quarter of fiscal 2017  , we issued   403,340   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to a registration statement. 
              (2) 
    Average price paid per share reflects the total cash outlay for the period, divided by the number of shares acquired, including those acquired by purchase or redemption for cash and any acquired by means of employee forfeiture.
