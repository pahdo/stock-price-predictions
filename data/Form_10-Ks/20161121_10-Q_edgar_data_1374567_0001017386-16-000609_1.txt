   FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  

Luvu Brands, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Luvu Brands , formerly known as Liberator, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 25, 1999.
References to the  Company  in these notes include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, OneUp Innovations,
Inc. ( OneUp ), and Foam Labs, Inc. ( Foam Labs ). 

The Company is primarily a manufacturer, designer
and online retailer of various specialty brands for the sexual wellness, fashion seating and top-of-bed comfort products markets. 
The Company has also become an online retailer of products for the sexual wellness market.  All of the Company s operations
are located in the same facility in Atlanta, Georgia, including product development, sales, manufacturing and administration.  Sales
are generated through internet and print advertisements.  We have a diversified customer base with only one customer
accounting for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the current and prior fiscal year and no particular concentration of credit
risk in one economic sector.  Foreign operations and foreign net sales are not material. Our business is seasonal and
as a result we experience higher sales in the second and third fiscal quarters. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of Luvu Brands, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company   we 
or  Luvu Brands ) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ( GAAP )
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
necessary for fair presentation have been included. The year-end condensed balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated
financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

Going Concern
-   The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, which  contemplates  continuation of the Company as a going concern. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $9,386,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately
$2,672,000.  This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

In view of these
matters, realization of a major portion of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations
of the Company, which in turn  is  dependent upon the Company s ability to meet its financing
requirements, and the success of its future operations.  Management believes that actions presently being taken to revise
the Company s operating and financial requirements provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  

These actions include an ongoing initiative
to increase sales, gross profits and our gross profit margin. To that end, we continued to make improvements to our e-commerce
sites during 2016. At the end of fiscal 2015 we ordered new equipment to increase our fabric cutting capacity; this equipment was
delivered and installed during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. At the end of fiscal 2016, we evaluated various options for increasing
the throughput of our compressed foam products and during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we purchased new equipment for installation
during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. These actions should yield higher sales at a lower cost of goods sold. We also plan to
continue to manage discretionary expense levels to be better aligned with current and expected revenue levels. We estimate that
the operational and strategic growth plans we have identified will require approximately $200,000 of funding over the next twelve
months, of which we estimate will be provided by debt financing and, to a lesser extent, cash flow from operations as well as cash
on hand. 

The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding
paragraph and eventually secure  other  sources of financing and attain profitable operations.  However,
management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing these plans.  The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

   FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation 

These consolidated financial statements include
the accounts and operations of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, OneUp Innovations, Inc. and Foam Labs, Inc. Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. 

The accompanying consolidated condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  These consolidated condensed financial
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements contained in the
Company s report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed on September 27, 2016. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period reported.  Management reviews these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effect of revisions
in the period that they are determined to be necessary.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates of:
income taxes; tax valuation reserves; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory valuation and reserves, share-based compensation;
and useful lives for depreciation and amortization.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition    

We recognize revenues as goods are shipped to
customers and title is transferred. The criteria for recognition of revenue are when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists
and both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably
assured. Sales returns and allowances are estimated and recorded as a reduction to sales in the period in which sales are recorded. 

The Company records product sales net of estimated
product returns and discounts from the list prices for its products. The amounts of product returns and the discount amounts have
not been material to date. The Company includes shipping and handling costs in cost of product sales. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

   FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)   

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects
management's best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance
based on historical experience, specifically identified nonpaying accounts and other currently available evidence. The Company
reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly with a focus on significant individual past due balances over 90 days. Account
balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery
is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 

The following is a summary of Accounts Receivable
as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

Inventories and Inventory Reserves 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Market is defined as sales price less cost to dispose
and a normal profit margin.  Inventory costs include materials, labor, depreciation and overhead. The company establishes
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events,
such as economic conditions, that may affect inventory. The reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may
be adjusted in response to changing conditions. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

The Company maintains
its cash accounts with banks located in Georgia.  The total cash balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000 per bank.  The Company had bank balances on deposit at September 30,
2016 that exceeded the balance insured by the FDIC by $77,523.   Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and
are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in North America and Europe. 

During the three month ended September 30, 2016,
we purchased 21% and 15% of total inventory purchases from two vendors. 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016,
we purchased 21% and 15% of total inventory purchases from two vendors. 

As of September 30, 2016 one of the Company s
customers (Amazon) represents 29% of the total accounts receivables compared to 32% as of June 2016. 

Fair Value of Financial and Derivative Instruments 

At September 30, 2016, our financial instruments
included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other debt. 

The fair values of these financial instruments
approximated their carrying values based on either their short maturity or current terms for similar instruments.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)   

The
Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities under the guidance of    ASC
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   , which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in   
   accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.       ASC
820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but its provisions apply to all other accounting   
   pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement.  

ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit
price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
ASC 820 requires the Company to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows: 

Level
1  : Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level
2  : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated inputs; and 

Level
3  : Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. 

The valuation techniques that may be used to
measure fair value are as follows: 

A.   Market
approach   - Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities. 

B.   Income
approach   - Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations
about those future amounts, including present value techniques, option-pricing models and excess earnings method. 

C.    Cost
approach   - Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement
cost). 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs
are expensed in the period when the advertisements are first aired or distributed to the public. Prepaid advertising (included
in  prepaid  expenses) was $20,001 at September 30, 2016 and $19,946 at June 30, 2016. Advertising
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $82,009 and $70,003, respectively.   

Research and Development 

Research and development
 expenses  for new products are expensed as they are incurred. Expenses for new product development
totaled $51,929 and $38,031for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development costs
are included in general and administrative expense.  

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment
are stated at cost.  Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over estimated service lives
for financial reporting purposes of 2-10 years. 

Expenditures for
major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for  maintenance 
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When properties are disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized currently.

Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets
to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
They are  tested  for recoverability using undiscounted cash flows to determine whether or not
impairment to such value has occurred as required by FASB ASC Topic No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. The Company has
determined that there was no impairment at September 30, 2016.  

Operating Leases 

On July 23, 2014, the Company entered into an
agreement with its landlord to extend the facilities lease by five years. The previous ten year lease was to expire on December
31, 2015. The agreement amends the lease to expire on December 31, 2020. The lease amendment was effective August 1, 2014 and included
a four-month rental abatement in the amount of $117,660. In exchange for the rental abatement, the Company agreed to make improvements
to the facility totaling $123,505 within six months of August 1, 2014. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has completed $65,224
of the leasehold improvements. In addition, the monthly rent on the facility decreased from the current rent of $33,139 to $29,415
per month, beginning on December 1, 2014. Beginning January 1, 2015, the monthly rent is on an escalating schedule with the final
year of the lease at $35,123 per month. The rent expense under this lease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was $88,120 and $88,120, respectively. 

The Company also leases certain equipment under
operating leases, as more fully described in Note 15 -  Commitments and Contingencies . 

Segment Information 

We have identified
three reportable sales channels :  Direct, Wholesale  and  Other .   Direct  includes product
sales  through  our five e-commerce sites and our single retail store.  Wholesale  includes
Liberator branded products sold to distributors and retailers, non- Liberator  products (purchased
products, Jaxx and Avana products) sold to retailers, and private label items sold to other resellers. The  Wholesale  category
also includes contract manufacturing services, which consists of specialty items that are manufactured in small quantities for
certain customers, and which, to date, has not been a material part of our business.  Other  consists principally of shipping
and handling fees and costs derived from our  Direct  business and fulfillment service fees. For the three months ending September
30, 2016, sales to and through Amazon accounted for 29% of our net sales.   

The following is a summary of sales results
for the Direct, Wholesale, and Other channels.

   FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which aims to eliminate diversity in
practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic
230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein,
beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for the Company). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to
determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

All other newly issued accounting pronouncements,
but not yet effective, have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 

Net Loss Per Share 

In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards
Codification No. 260 ( FASB ASC 260 ),  Earnings Per Share , basic net loss per share is computed by dividing
the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares outstanding as of September
30, 2016 and 2015, which consist of options, warrants, and convertible notes, have been excluded from the diluted net loss per
common share calculations because they are anti-dilutive. 

The following potentially issuable common shares
were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because they would have an anti-dilutive: 

Income Taxes 

We utilize the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax
assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies
in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable. We
have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against
deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period. If we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that
we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination.
We expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates
our ability to realize these assets. 

Stock Based Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation to employees
in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. We measure the cost of each stock option and restricted
stock award at its fair value on the grant date. Each award vests over the subsequent period during which the recipient is required
to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). The cost of each award is recognized as expense in the financial
statements over the respective vesting period.

with FASB ASC 505, the stock options or common stock warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis
of the market price of the underlying common stock on the  valuation date , which for options and warrants related
to contracts that have substantial disincentives to non-performance is the date of the contract, and for all other contracts is
the vesting date. Expense related to the options and warrants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period
over which services are to be received or the vesting period. Where expense must be recognized prior to a valuation date, the expense
is computed under the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock at the
end of the period, and any subsequent changes in the market price of the underlying common stock up through the valuation date
is reflected in the expense recorded in the subsequent period in which that change occurs.

NOTE 4. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC ) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, regarding impairment of our other
long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment). Our policy is to assess our long-lived assets for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable. 

An impairment loss is recognized only if the
carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value.
The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use of long-lived asset. 

Assets to be disposed of and related liabilities
would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Assets to be disposed of would be reported at the lower of the
carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and would not be depreciated.  There was no impairment as of September
30, 2016 or June 30, 2016. 

NOTE 5. INVENTORIES, NET  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(which approximates first-in, first-out) or market. Market is defined as sales price less cost to dispose and a normal profit margin. 
Inventories consisted of the following: 

NOTE 6. EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS  

Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated
at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for equipment
and furniture and fixtures, or the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. 

Equipment and leasehold improvements consisted
of the following: 

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to forecasted undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds its estimated future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized
to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value. Management has determined no asset impairment occurred
during the three months ended September 30, 2016

Advance Financial Corporation, to provide it with an asset based line of credit of up to $750,000 against 85% of eligible accounts
receivable (as defined in the agreement) for the purpose of improving working capital.  The term of the agreement was
one year, renewable for additional one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior
to the end of the current financing period. The credit facility was secured by our accounts receivable and other rights to payment,

under the agreement were charged interest at a rate of 2.5% over the lenders Index Rate.  In addition there was a Monthly
Service Fee (as defined in the agreement) of up to 1.25% per month.

to finance capital requirements required by operations. If new business opportunities do arise, additional outside funding may
be required.

increase 15% every year, with 12 payments of $16,450.45 during year five. In the event the Company fails to make a monthly payment
under the Note or the Company is subject to an bankruptcy event (as defined under the Note), subject to the Company s ability
to cure such default, HCI may convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other
sums due and payable under the Note into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.10 per share. Conversion
is subject to HCI not being able to beneficially own more than 9.99% of our outstanding common stock upon any conversion, subject
to waiver by HCI. The Company has the right to prepay the Note, in whole or in part, subject to notice to HCI, without penalty.
At September 30, 2016, the principal balance under the Note was $493,720.

ITEM
2.                         
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 Results of Operations 

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, information derived from our Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, expressed as a percentage
of net sales.  The discussion that follows the table should be read in conjunction with our Interim Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following table represents the net sales and percentage
of net sales by product type: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

Net sales  . The Company achieved
record first quarter sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016   of $4,105,197, a 10%
increase from the comparable prior year period.  The net sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was driven
primarily by a $333,000 (or 60%) increase in the combined sales of Jaxx and Avana products. Sales of Liberator branded products
also increased 7% during the quarter from the comparable prior year period. These increases were partially offset by an 11% decrease
in sales of Resale products, including Tenga products. Sales through the Direct channel in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased
13% from the same period in the prior year. The Direct sales channel consists of direct to consumer sales through our five e-Commerce
sites and, to a lesser extent, our single retail store. Sales through the Wholesale channel increased 10% during the three months
ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to higher sales of Jaxx and Avana products. The Wholesale channel includes sales of Liberator
branded products to retailers, e-merchants (including Amazon and Brookstone and others), non-Liberator products sold to retailers
and e-merchants, and private label items sold to other resellers. The Other product revenue increased 78% to $194,328 in the
three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of greater sales of products made under contract for third parties. 

Gross margin .  Gross profit, derived
from net sales less the cost of goods sold, includes the cost of materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, freight costs
and depreciation.  Despite a 10% increase in net sales, gross profit increased 7% to $977,099 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016   from $913,846 in the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage
of sales decreased from 24.5% in the prior year period to 23.8% in the current year, primarily due to higher labor costs related
to product assembly and packaging. The Company purchased compress and roll pack equipment that it expects to install by the end
of the current calendar year. This new equipment is expected to reduce labor costs and increase production capacity to keep pace
with increasing demand for the Company s compressed products. 

24 

Operating expenses  . Total operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016   were 24% of net sales, or approximately
$1,002,000, compared to 28% of net sales, or approximately $1,034,000, for the same period in the prior year.  Although
total operating expenses were essentially unchanged from the prior year, Other selling and marketing expense decreased 17% to approximately
$285,000, primarily due to lower personnel related costs. General and administrative increased 4% to approximately $584,000, primarily
due to higher business insurance expense, and costs related to providing employee health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care
Act. 

Other income (expense)   . 
Other income (expense) during the first quarter increased from expense of approximately ($102,000) in fiscal 2016 to expense of
approximately ($152,000) during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing balances
and higher interest expense on those larger balances. 

Variability of Results 

We have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations
in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in future periods. Operating results have fluctuated as
a result of changes in sales levels to consumers and wholesalers, competition, seasonality costs associated with new product introductions,
and increases in raw material costs. In addition, future operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control
such as foreign exchange fluctuation, changes in government regulations, and economic changes in the regions in which we operate
and sell. A portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed and the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large
part on forecasts of future sales. Therefore, if net sales are below expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on results
of operations may be magnified by our inability to meaningfully adjust spending in certain areas, or the inability to adjust spending
quickly enough, as in personnel and administrative costs, to compensate for a sales shortfall. We may also choose to increase spending
in response to market conditions, and these decisions may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of
operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The following table summarizes our cash flows:    

Three Months Ended  

September 30,  
 
     (Dollars in thousands)    
     2016    
     2015  

(Unaudited)  
 
     Cash flow data:    

Cash (used in) provided by operating activities    
     $  (250  )    
     $  48     
 
     Cash used in investing activities    
     $  (18  )    
     $  (32  )  
 
     Cash provided by (used in) financing activities    
     $  62       
     $  (56  )  

As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash
equivalents totaled $339,385, compared to $452,589 in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2015. 

For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our principal
sources of liquidity are our cash flow that we generate from our operations, availability of borrowings under our line of credit
and cash raised through equity and debt financings. 

25 

Operating Activities  

Net cash used in the operating activities was
$250,040 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $47,856 net cash provided by the operating activities in the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reason for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities
is the net loss of $176,689 and an increase in inventories of $80,473, an increase in accounts receivable of $67,119 and a decrease
in accrued compensation of $64,264, offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of $84,766. 

Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing activities in the three
months ended September 30, 2016   was $17,847 and related to the purchase and installation of new
production equipment during the first quarter. 

Financing Activities  

Cash provided by financing activities
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $62,500 was primarily attributable to the increase of borrowings under credit
card advance, offset in part by repayments of unsecured note payable, repayment of term note-shareholder and payments on equipment
notes and capital leases. 

 Cash used in financing activities during the
three months ended September 30, 2015   of $55,602 was primarily attributable to the repayment
of debt obligations, offset in part by the proceeds from an unsecured note payable of $200,000. 

Inflation  

We cannot determine the precise effects of inflation;
however, inflation continues to have an influence on the cost of materials, salaries, and transportation costs.  We attempt
to offset the effects of inflation through increased selling prices, productivity improvements, and reduction of costs. 

Sufficiency of Liquidity  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplates continuation of the Company
as a going concern. We incurred a net loss of approximately $177,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a net loss
of approximately $312,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately
$9,386,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $2,672,000. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

In view of these matters, realization of a major
portion of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is
dependent upon our ability to meet our financing requirements, and the success of our future operations. Management believes that
actions presently being taken to revise our operating and financial requirements provide the opportunity for the Company to continue
as a going concern. 

These actions include an ongoing initiative
to increase sales, gross profits and our gross profit margin. To that end, we continued to make improvements to our e-commerce
sites during 2016. At the end of fiscal 2015 we ordered new equipment to increase our fabric cutting capacity; this equipment was
delivered and installed during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. At the end of fiscal 2016, we evaluated various options for increasing
the throughput of our compressed foam products and during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we purchased new equipment for installation
during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. These actions should yield higher sales at a lower cost of goods sold. We also plan to
continue to manage discretionary expense levels to be better aligned with current and expected revenue levels. We estimate that
the operational and strategic growth plans we have identified will require approximately $200,000 of funding, of which we estimate
will be provided by debt financing and, to a lesser extent, cash flow from operations as well as cash on hand.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
REFORM ACT OF 1995.  

Except for the historical information contained
herein, the matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include certain forward-looking statements. Those statements
include, but may not be limited to, all statements regarding management s intent, belief, and expectations, such as statements
concerning our future profitability and our operating and growth strategy. Words such as believe,  anticipate,  expect, 
will,  may,  should,  intend,  plan,  estimate,  predict,  potential,  continue, 
likely  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 

In addition, any statements that refer to our plans, expectations,
strategies or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that
these forward-looking statements are predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason. 

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   

Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA
income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA income (loss)
represents net loss before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation
expense. We have excluded the non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation, as they do not reflect the cash-based operations
of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not required by or defined under GAAP (Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles). The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, including the net loss of the Company or net cash used
in operating activities. 

Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the Company s net income or net loss
as determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not a substitute for or a measure of the Company s profitability or net earnings.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance and
liquidity, and because it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and non-cash charges
for stock-based compensation expense. 

ITEM 3.                         
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We do not enter into any transactions using
derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with
other financial instruments is not material. 

27 

ITEM 4.                         
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer (Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (Chief Financial Officer),
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, were effective at the reasonable
assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in United States Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the management, including CEO and CFO, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
