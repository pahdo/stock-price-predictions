 NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 The consolidated financial statements include Community First, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Community First Bank   Trust.  Community First, Inc., together with the Bank, is referred to herein as the  Company.  The sole subsidiary of Community First Bank   Trust is Community First Properties, Inc. ( Properties ), which was originally established as a Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ) but which terminated its REIT election in the first quarter of 2012.   Community First Bank   Trust together with its subsidiary is referred to herein as the  Bank.    Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Bank conducts substantially all of its banking activities in Maury, Williamson, and Hickman Counties in Tennessee.  Its primary deposit products are checking, savings, and term certificate accounts, and its primary lending products are residential mortgage, commercial, and installment loans.  Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate.  Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows from operations of businesses.  The significant loan concentrations that exceed 10% of total loans are as follows:  commercial real estate loans, 1-4 family residential loans, and construction loans.  The customers  ability to repay these types of loans is dependent on the real estate and general economic conditions in the Company s market areas.  Other financial instruments, which potentially represent concentrations of credit risk, include deposit accounts in other financial institutions and federal funds sold. 
 The unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the information.  They do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. For further information, refer to the 2015 consolidated audited financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 9, 2016 (File No. 000-49966) (the  2015 Form 10-K ). 
 Critical Accounting Policies: 
 The consolidated financial statements in this report are prepared in conformity with GAAP and with general practices in the banking industry. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. A summary of our significant accounting policies is described in our 2015 Form 10-K. The significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: 
  Allowance for Loan Losses :  Credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans to borrowers.  This credit risk is addressed through a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.  Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. 
 The allowance consists of specific and general components.  The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. 
 A loan is identified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the scheduled payments of principal or interest will not be collected when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  However, some loans are considered impaired because of doubt regarding collectability of interest and principal according to the contractual terms, even though such loans are both fully secured by collateral and current in their interest and principal payments.  Additionally, loans are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired if their terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties.

  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BAS  IS OF PRESENTATION   (Continued)  
 Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 
 All loans over $250 that are unlikely to be collected under existing terms are individually evaluated for impairment.  If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures. 
 Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s effective rate at inception.  If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral.  For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses. 
 The general component of the allowance covers loans collectively evaluated for impairment and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors.  The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent four years.  This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment.  These economic factors include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following:  levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.  The following loan portfolio segments have been identified with a discussion of the risk characteristics of these portfolio segments: 
 Real Estate Construction loans consist of loans made for both residential and commercial construction and land development.  Residential real estate construction loans are loans secured by real estate to build 1-4 family dwellings.  These are loans made to borrowers obtaining loans in their personal name for the personal construction of their own dwellings or loans to builders for the purpose of constructing homes for resale.  These loans to builders can be for speculative homes for which there is no specific homeowner for which the home is being built, as well as loans to builders that have a pre-sale contract to another party. 
 Commercial Construction loans are loans extended to borrowers secured by and to build commercial structures such as churches, retail strip centers, industrial warehouses or office buildings.  Land development loans are granted to commercial borrowers to finance the improvement of real estate by adding infrastructure so that ensuing construction can take place.  Construction and land development loans are generally short term in maturity to match the expected completion of a particular project.  These loan types are generally more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions in that they project there will be a demand for the product.  They require monitoring to ensure the project is progressing in a timely manner within the expected budgeted amount.  This monitoring is accomplished via periodic physical inspections by an outside third party. 
 1-4 Family Residential loans consist of both open end and closed end loans secured by first or junior liens on 1-4 family improved residential dwellings.  Open end loans are home equity lines of credit that allow the borrower to use equity in the real estate to borrow and repay as the need arises.  First and junior lien residential real estate loans are closed end loans with a specific maturity that generally does not exceed seven years.  Economic conditions can affect the borrower s ability to repay the loans, and the value of the real estate securing the loans can change over the life of the loan. 
 Commercial Real Estate loans consist of loans secured by farmland or by improved commercial property.  Farmland includes all land known to be used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as crop and livestock production, grazing, or pasture land.  Improved commercial property can be owner occupied or non-owner occupied property secured by commercial structures such as churches, retail strip centers, hotels, industrial warehouses or office buildings.  The repayment of these loans tends to depend upon the operation and management of a business or lease income from a business, and therefore adverse economic conditions can affect the borrower s ability to repay.

  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   (Continued)  
 Other Real Estate Secured loans consist of loans secured by five or more multi-family dwelling units.  These loans are typically exemplified by apartment buildings or complexes.  The ability to manage and rent units affects the income that usually provides repayment for this type of loan. 
 Commercial, Financial, and Agricultural loans consist of loans extended for the operation of a business or a farm.  They are not secured by real estate.  Commercial loans are used to provide working capital, acquire inventory, finance the carrying of receivables, purchase equipment or vehicles, or purchase other capital assets. Agricultural loans are typically for purposes such as planting crops, acquiring livestock, or purchasing farm equipment.  The repayment of these loans comes from the cash flow of a business or farm and is generated by sales of inventory or providing of services.  The collateral tends to depreciate over time and is difficult to monitor.  Frequent statements are required from the borrower pertaining to inventory levels or receivables aging. 
 Consumer loans consist largely of loans extended to individuals for purposes such as to purchase a vehicle or other consumer goods. These loans are not secured by real estate but are frequently collateralized by the consumer items being acquired with the loan proceeds.  This type of collateral tends to depreciate, and therefore the term of the loan is tailored to fit the expected value of the collateral as it depreciates, along with specific underwriting policies and guidelines. 
 Tax Exempt loans consist of loans that are extended to entities such as municipalities.  These loans tend to be dependent on the ability of the borrowing entity to continue to collect taxes to repay the indebtedness. 
 Other loans consist of those loans which are not elsewhere classified in these categories and are not secured by real estate. 
  Accounting Standards Newly Adopted:  
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Statement of Cash Flows, including (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investees, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For public companies, this amendment becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The ASU impacts the presentation of specific items within the Statement of Cash Flows and is not expected to have a material impact to the Company. 
 On June 16, 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ). The update will significantly change the way entities recognize impairment on many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the asset's remaining life.  FASB describes this impairment recognition model as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model and believes the CECL model will result in more timely recognition of credit losses since the CECL model incorporates expected credit losses versus incurred credit losses. The scope of FASB s CECL model would include loans, held-to-maturity debt instruments, lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not accounted for at fair value. For public companies, this update becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and will continue to monitor FASB s progress on this topic. 
 In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 amends the accounting model and disclosure requirements for leases. The current accounting model for leases distinguishes between capital leases, which are recognized on-balance sheet, and operating leases, which are not. Under the new standard, the lease classifications are defined as finance leases, which are similar to capital leases under current GAAP, and operating leases. Further, a lessee will recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet regardless of the lease s classification, which may significantly increase reported assets and liabilities.  The accounting model and disclosure requirements for lessors remains substantially unchanged from current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.   Management is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's financial position and results of operations as well as its consolidated financial statements.

  NOTE 2 - SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE   (Continued)  
 The amortized cost and fair value of the securities portfolio are shown by contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Mortgage backed securities are presented separately due to varying maturity dates as a result of prepayments. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, securities totaling $44,751 and $46,757 were pledged to secure public deposits. 
 The Company did not hold securities of any one issuer with a face amount greater than 10% of shareholders  equity as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
 The following table summarizes securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 aggregated by major security type and length of time in a continuous unrealized loss position: 

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment 
 Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments   securities in a loss position for less than 12 months and securities in a loss position for 12 months or more   and applying the appropriate OTTI model.  Securities classified as available for sale are generally evaluated for OTTI under the provisions of ASC 320-10,  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities . In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the Company has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.

  NOTE 2 - SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE   (Continued)  
 When OTTI occurs, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s securities portfolio consisted of 53 securities, 9 of which were in an unrealized loss position. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company did not have at September 30, 2016 the intent to sell these securities and at that date it was likely that it would not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.

The Company lost $7 and $107 of interest income in the nine months and $1 and $95 of interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that would have been recorded in interest income if the specific loans had not been restructured.  Troubled debt restructurings still accruing interest totaled $704 and $6,729 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Bank had no commitments to lend additional funds to loans classified as troubled debt restructurings at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
 During the first nine months of 2016, the terms of certain loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings. The modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or granting of amortization terms for balloon notes that are longer than the Bank s typical practice. 
 Modifications involving a reduction of the stated interest rate and extension of the maturity date of the loan were for periods ranging from six months to two years.

  NOTE 3   LOANS   (Continued)  
 Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are included in impaired loans. 
 Changes in the Company s restructured loans are set forth in the table below: 

The following table presents loans by class modified as troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015: 

The only troubled debt restructurings occurring in 2016, as described in the table above, had an outstanding balance of $22 at September 30, 2016. There was no increase for the allowance for loan losses and no specific reserve recorded during the first nine months of 2016 associated with the troubled debt restructuring occurring in 2016. 
   
 The pre-modificaiton and post-modification recorded investment amount represents the recorded investment on the date of the loan modification.  Since the modifications on this loan were an interest rate concession and payment term extension, not principal reductions, the pre-modification and post-modification recorded investment is the same.  
 A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is more than 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.  There were no troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.

 In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without modification.  This evaluation is performed in accordance with the Company s internal loan policy.  Nonperforming loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. 
 The following table presents the recorded investment in nonaccrual loans and loans past due over 90 days still accruing by class of loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Credit Quality Indicators: 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk.  The Company assigns an initial credit risk rating on every loan.  All loan relationships with aggregate debt greater than $250 are reviewed at least annually or more frequently if performance of the loan or other factors warrants review.  Smaller balance loans are reviewed and evaluated based on changes in loan performance, such as becoming past due or upon notifying the Bank of a change in the borrower s financial status.  This analysis is performed on a monthly basis.  The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Watch.  Loans characterized by borrowers who have marginal cash flow, marginal profitability, or have experienced operating losses and declining financial condition.  The borrower has satisfactorily handled debts with the Bank in the past, but in recent months has either been late, delinquent in making payments, or made sporadic payments.  While the Bank continues to be adequately secured, the borrower s margins have decreased or are decreasing, despite the borrower s continued satisfactory condition.  Other characteristics of borrowers in this class include inadequate credit information and weakness of financial statement and repayment capacity, but with collateral that appears to limit the Bank s exposure.  This classification includes loans to established borrowers that are reasonably margined by collateral, but where potential for improvement in financial capacity is limited. 
 Special Mention.  Loans with potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deteriorating prospects for the repayment source or in the Bank s credit position in the future. 
 Substandard.  Loans inadequately protected by the payment capacity of the borrower or the pledged collateral. 
 Doubtful.  Loans with the same characteristics as substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values.   These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collectability in full in a reasonable period of time or evidence of permanent impairment in the collateral securing the loan.

 Impaired loans are evaluated separately from other loans in the Bank s portfolio.  Credit quality information related to impaired loans was presented above and is excluded from the tables below. 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk categories of loans by class of loans are as follows:

NOTE 4 - INCOME PER SHARE 
 In accordance with ASC 260-10,  Earnings Per Share , basic income per share available to common shareholders is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted income per share available to common shareholders reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities, stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income of the Company.  The factors used in the income per share computation follow: 

At September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, stock options for 27,550 and 42,400 shares of common stock were not considered in computing diluted net income per share for the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because they were antidilutive. 

NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES 
 The Company recorded $1,209 of income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $386 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which is an effective tax rate of 36.96% and 37.84%, respectively.  Due to economic conditions and losses recognized between 2008 and 2015, the Company established a valuation allowance against materially all of its deferred tax assets.  Due to improvements in the Company s performance and overall condition, management determined during the fourth quarter of 2015 that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax asset can be realized through current and future taxable income.  The Company has approximately $49,442 in net operating losses for state tax purposes that begin to expire in 2023 and $21,619 for federal tax purposes that begin to expire in 2031 to be utilized by future earnings.

  NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE   
 Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
 Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
 The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities:  The Company uses an independent third party to value its mortgage-backed securities, which are obligations that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government and consist of Government Sponsored Entities that either issue the securities or guarantee the collection of principal and interest payments thereon. The third party s valuation approach uses relevant information generated by recently executed transactions that have occurred in the market place that involve similar assets, as well as using cash flow information when necessary. These inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly in the market place for similar assets. The Company considers these valuations to be Level 2 pricing; however, when the securities are added to the portfolio after the third party s system-wide market value monthly update, the valuations are considered Level 3 pricing. 
 State and Municipal Securities:  The valuation of the Company s state and municipal securities is supported by analysis prepared by an independent third party. The third party s approach to determining fair value involves using recently executed transactions for similar securities and market quotations for similar securities. For these securities that are rated by the rating agencies and have recent trades, the Company considers these valuations to be Level 2 pricing. For these securities that are not rated by the rating agencies and for which trading volumes are thin, the valuations are considered Level 3 pricing. 
 Corporate Securities:  For corporate securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows (Level 3) as determined by an independent third party. The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation model include discount rates and yields or current spreads to the United States Department of the Treasury (the  U.S. Treasury ) rates. 
 Loans Held for Sale: Generally, the fair value of loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for loans with similar characteristics or based on an agreed upon sales price with third party investors and typically result in a Level 2 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  The Company has elected to carry mortgage loans held for sale at fair value on a recurring basis as permitted under the guidance in ASC 825   Financial Instruments. 
 Impaired Loans: The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.

  NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE   (Continued)  
 Other Real Estate Owned: Real estate acquired through foreclosure on a loan or by surrender of the real estate in lieu of foreclosure is called  OREO . OREO is initially recorded at the fair value of the property less estimated costs to sell, which establishes a new cost basis. OREO is subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Valuation adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Valuation adjustments are also required when the listing price to sell an OREO property has had to be reduced below the current carrying value. If there is a decrease in the fair value of the property from the last valuation, the decrease in value is charged to noninterest expense. All income produced from, changes in fair values in, and gains and losses on OREOs is also included in noninterest expense. During the time the property is held, all related operating and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Appraisals for both collateral dependent impaired loans and OREO are performed by certified general appraisers, certified residential appraisers or state licensed appraisers whose qualifications and licenses are annually reviewed and verified by the Bank. Once received, either Bank personnel or an independent review appraiser reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal, as well as the overall resulting fair value, and determines whether the appraisal is reasonable. Appraisals for collateral dependent impaired loans and OREO are updated annually. On an annual basis, the Company compares the actual selling costs of collateral that has been liquidated to the selling price to determine what additional adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, the Company s analysis indicated that a discount of 15% should be applied to properties with appraisals performed within 12 months. 
 Mortgage Banking Derivatives: Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market are accounted for as free standing derivatives. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on the anticipated gain from the sale of the underlying loan. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in noninterest income as gain on sale of loans.

Impaired loans, with specific allocations or partial charge offs based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a recorded investment of $262 at September 30, 2016, with a valuation allowance of $44, resulting in no additional provision for loan losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. No additional provision was recorded in the first nine months of 2015 on impaired loans. Impaired loans, with specific allocations or partial charge offs based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a recorded investment of $490, with a valuation allowance of $166, resulting in no additional provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Other real estate owned, measured at the lower of carrying or fair value less costs to sell, had a net carrying amount of $4,888, which is made up of the outstanding balance of $6,305, net of a valuation allowance of $1,417 at September 30, 2016, resulting in a write-down of $168 charged to expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a write-down of $308 charged to expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net carrying amount was $6,320 at December 31, 2015, which was made up of the outstanding balance of $8,188, net of a valuation allowance of $1,868.

  NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE   (Continued)  

Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, demand deposits, short-term debt, and variable rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully resulting in a Level 1 classification. The method for determining fair values of securities was discussed elsewhere in this footnote. Restricted equity securities do not have readily determinable fair values due to their restrictions on transferability, therefore cost basis is appropriate fair value. For fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk resulting in a Level 3 classification. For fixed and variable rate deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk resulting in a Level 2 classification. Fair value for impaired loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis or underlying collateral values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair value of loans held for sale is based on market quotes resulting in a Level 2 classification. Fair value of subordinated debentures is based on discounted cash flows using current rates for similar financing resulting in a Level 3 classification. The fair value of off-balance-sheet items is not considered material. 

NOTE 7   REGULATORY MATTERS 
 Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of $1 billion and banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies.  Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate regulatory actions that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements. 
 Prompt corrective action regulations classify banks into one of five capital categories depending on how well they meet their minimum capital requirements.  Although these terms are not used to represent the overall financial condition of a bank, the classifications are:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.  If adequately capitalized or worse, or subject to a written agreement, consent order, or cease and desist order requiring higher minimum capital levels, regulatory approval would be required for the Bank to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits.  If a bank is classified as undercapitalized or worse, its capital distributions are restricted, as is its asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required.  At September 30, 2016, the Bank s capital ratios were above those levels necessary to be considered  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Because the Company s total assets were less than $1,000,000 at September 30, 2016, the Company is not required to maintain certain capital levels on a consolidated basis.   
 On February 29, 2016, the Company was notified by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (the  FRB-Atlanta ) that the written agreement the Company had entered into in the second quarter of 2012 (the  Written Agreement ) with the FRB-Atlanta had been terminated as of February 29, 2016.

  NOTE 7   REGULATORY MATTERS   (Continued)  
 The Company s principal source of funds for dividend and/or interest payments is dividends received from the Bank.  Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.  Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above.  At September 30, 2016, the Bank could dividend up to $12,619 to the Company, without the consent of the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (the  Department ) or the FDIC. 
 Banks and bank holding companies with total assets in excess of $1,000,000 are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by State and Federal banking agencies.  The Company s and the Bank s capital amounts and ratios at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows: 

The Bank s capital ratios at September 30, 2016 were above those levels necessary to be considered  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

  NOTE 7   REGULATORY MATTERS   (Continued)  
   
 In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators, in response to the statutory requirements of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ), adopted new regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord ( Basel III ) and the related minimum capital ratios. These capital requirements which were effective January 1, 2015 and apply to bank holding companies with total assets in excess of $1,000,000 and to banks, include a new  Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio , which has stricter rules as to what qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.  A summary of the changes to the regulatory capital ratios are as follows:

The guidelines under Basel III also establish a 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement that is phased in over three years beginning January 1, 2016. The buffer is related to risk weighted assets. The Basel III minimum requirements for capital adequacy after giving effect to the buffer are as follows: 

As described above, because the Company s total assets are less than $1,000,000, the Company will not be required to comply with these new capital guidelines required under Basel III until its total assets exceed $1,000,000. 
 In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions such as dividends and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain capital ratios above the minimum ratios including the buffer. The requirements of Basel III also place additional restrictions on the inclusion of deferred tax assets and capitalized mortgage servicing rights as a percentage of Tier 1 Capital. In addition, the risk weights assigned to certain assets such as past due loans and certain real estate loans have been increased. The requirements of Basel III allowed banks and bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation.  The Company and the Bank have opted out of this requirement.

  NOTE 8   PREFERRED STOCK RESTRUCTURE  
 On February 25, 2016 holders of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock and the Company s common stock, no par value per share (the  Common Stock ), approved amendments to the Company s charter (the  Charter Amendments ) to modify the terms of the Company s Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the  Series A Preferred Stock ) to, among other things, (i) cancel the amount of undeclared dividends in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) reduce the liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Stock to $650 per share plus the amount of any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends; (iii) reduce the dividend rate payable on the Series A Preferred Stock from 9% per annum to 5% per annum; (iv) change the designation of the Series A Preferred Stock from  Cumulative  to  Non-Cumulative  and change the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock such that dividends or distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock will not accumulate unless declared by the Company s board of directors and subsequently not paid; and (v) eliminate the restrictions on the Company s ability to pay dividends or make distributions on, or repurchase, shares of its Common Stock or other junior stock or stock ranking in parity with the Series A Preferred Stock prior to paying accumulated but undeclared dividends or distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock.  The Charter Amendments were effective on February 26, 2016.  As a result of the Charter Amendments in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reversed $4,386 of accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock that reduced the Company s accumulated deficit by the same amount and $4,167 of face value that increased the Company s additional paid-in capital, which is included in Common Stock, by the same amount. 
 On April 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Conversion Agreement (the  Conversion Agreement ) that provided for the conversion of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock, having a liquidation preference of $650 per share, into shares of the Company s Common Stock. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, each holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, including the Company s directors and executive officers that owned such shares, had each share of his or her Series A Preferred Stock converted into 136.84 shares of Common Stock (the  Conversion Shares ) as of June 30, 2016, representing an effective conversion price for each share of Common Stock of $4.75.  Under the terms of the Conversion Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,629,097 shares of Common Stock to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.  The issuance of the Conversion Shares was approved by the Company s board of directors and separately by the members of the board of directors that did not own any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.

ITEM 2.   
 
        MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

 OVERVIEW 
 (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) 
 The following discussion compares the financial condition of the Company at September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2015, and the results of operations for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2015.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 At September 30, 2016, total assets were $475,068 and total liabilities were $444,861 for an increase in assets of $5,128 or 1.1% compared to $469,940 at December 31, 2015 and a decrease in liabilities of $2,114 or 0.5%, compared to $446,975 at December 31, 2015.  The increase in assets was caused primarily by increases in net loans and cash and cash equivalents offset in part by decreases in securities available for sale and other real estate owned.  The decrease in liabilities was caused primarily by decreases in interest-bearing deposits and other liabilities offset in part by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.  Total shareholders  equity increased $7,242, or 31.5%, to $30,207 at September 30, 2016 compared to $22,965 at December 31, 2015.  The increase in equity was primarily due to the forgiveness of Series A Preferred Stock accrued dividends combined with net income during the first nine months of 2016. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents were $24,550 at September 30, 2016 compared to $19,387 at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale offset in part by funding of loan growth. 
 Time Deposits in Other Financial Institutions 
 Time deposits in other financial institutions totaled $25,048 at September 30, 2016 compared to $24,305 at December 31, 2015.  Management continues to utilize time deposits in other financial institutions in conjunction with the Bank s securities portfolio in order to maximize yield and maintain a reasonable total duration for the Bank s assets outside of the loan portfolio.   Original maturities of time deposits in other financial institutions range from four months to five years.   Most of the CDs with maturities beyond three years are callable with minimal early withdrawal penalties.  All of the deposits are in FDIC or National Credit Union Administration insured institutions and the amount on deposit with each individual institution does not exceed the deposit insurance limit of $250.  As of September 30, 2016, time deposits in other financial institutions had a weighted average rate of 1.34% and a weighted average remaining life of 0.161 years.  
 Loans 
 Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at September 30, 2016 were $302,371, compared to $264,469 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $37,902 or 14.3%.  The increase in loans during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to increased loan demand within the Bank s core market and due to purchases of individual loans from other institutions.  The increase in loan demand was primarily due to improvement in the economy in the Bank s market areas.  The most significant increases in loans were in commercial real estate, 1-4 family residential, and real estate construction segments.

FINANCIAL CONDITION   (Continued)  
 Loans in the portfolio at September 30, 2016 of approximately $61,790, or 20.4%, are at a variable rate of interest while $238,909, or 79.0%, are at a fixed rate, and $1,672, or 0.6%, are nonaccrual.  Within one year of September 30, 2016, $58,159, or 19.2%, of total loans are subject to repricing. As market rates dropped during the economic recession, management implemented rate floors for many variable rate loans in an effort to protect the Bank s net interest margin.  As a result, when market rates begin to rise, loans at their floor will not reprice at higher rates until market rates rise above their contractual floor rates.  Only the loans noted above that have variable rates not at a floor rate will reprice with the first increase in market rates.  The existence of these rate floors may negatively impact our net interest margin when rates begin to rise, at least until rates rise above these floors. 
 On September 30, 2016, the Company s loan to deposit ratio (including loans held for sale) was 72.2%, compared to 63.5% at December 31, 2015.  Management expects loan demand to modestly improve through the remainder of 2016, though foreclosure activity could result in some additional decreases in loan balances.   
 Securities Available for Sale 
 Set forth below is a table showing the carrying amount and breakdown of the Company s securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The Company s securities portfolio is used, among other things, to provide yield and for pledging purposes to secure public fund deposits.  As of September 30, 2016, the carrying value of securities decreased $34,916 to $83,908, compared to $118,824 at December 31, 2015.  This decrease is primarily due to selling securities in order to fund loan demand during the first nine months of 2016.  Securities available for sale as a percentage of total assets was 17.7% at September 30, 2016, compared to 25.3% at December 31, 2015.  Net unrealized gain on securities available for sale was $1,031 at September 30, 2016, compared to a net unrealized loss of $418 at December 31, 2015. Changes in interest rates in the securities market combined with changes in the makeup of our portfolio were the primary cause of this fluctuation in the net unrealized loss/gain.  Management is continually monitoring the credit quality of the Bank s investments and believes that the unrealized losses that existed in the Bank s portfolio at September 30, 2016 are temporary based on the bond ratings and anticipated recovery of the bonds held.  At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 At September 30, 2016, other real estate owned ( OREO ) totaled $4,888, a decrease of $2,940 from $7,828 at December 31, 2015.  This decrease is primarily due to the sale of properties during the first nine months of 2016.  The balance of OREO is comprised of properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure on real estate loans, and loans made to facilitate the sale of OREO properties that are required to be reported as OREO. The balances recorded for each individual property are based on appraisals that are not more than twelve months old, discounted by 15%.  The 15% discount was adopted by the Company beginning in the third quarter of 2010 based on an analysis of actual recoveries of OREO balances, including selling costs.  Based on that analysis, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $346 (recognized through OREO expense) in the third quarter of 2010.  In addition, the Company began applying the 15% discount in its determination of specific reserves for impaired loans that are collateral dependent.  As a result, we believe the majority of the financial loss incurred by the Company as a result of the 15% discount has been recognized through loan charge-offs and the provision for loan losses at the time the property is transferred to OREO, with the foreclosed property being transferred into OREO at the discounted value. The Company annually updates its analysis regarding the 15% discount.  Should such updates indicate that a change in the 15% discount is warranted, the Company would implement the change accordingly and that change would be applied to all properties that are subsequently moved into OREO.  Additional write-downs of individual properties typically occur when the results of updated appraisals and further application of the 15% discount on the value reflected in the updated appraisal indicates that the value of the respective property has declined.  The Company obtains updated appraisals for OREO properties at least every twelve months.  These write-downs are recognized in the quarterly period in which the appraisal is accepted by the Company.

FINANCIAL CONDITION   (Continued)  
 The Company actively markets the properties within its OREO portfolio utilizing both Bank personnel and third parties (brokers, agents, etc.). All OREO properties are classified into one of four categories: rental properties, non-rental properties, auction properties, and land. Rental properties consist of any property that can be leased or rented in order to produce income for the Company while the Company is pursuing the sale of the property.  Non-rental properties consist of improved real estate that the Company s management has concluded would not be attractive to a renter or that management believes will be most efficiently sold unoccupied. Auction properties are typically properties of lower value that the Company is willing to accept the risk of an auction in order to sell. These properties are typically auctioned off within six to twelve months of the property being transferred into OREO; however, circumstances related to a particular property may warrant holding the property for a longer period. Auction properties are typically auctioned off in absolute auctions with no minimum reserves. Land generally consists of unimproved raw land, though some properties may have some infrastructure work completed for housing development. Properties within the land category of OREO are typically held for longer periods of time than other OREO properties as the marketing of these properties, particularly large parcels, often extends for over six months. 
 The following table shows a breakdown of the OREO portfolio by category as of the end of the periods indicated: 

The Company makes every effort to sell OREO as quickly as feasible while still recovering as much of the original investment as possible.  Management also considers the cost associated with holding individual properties in determining how aggressively it markets an individual property.  The Company s OREO that is classified as rental properties generally consists of 1-4 family properties, though some are commercial real estate.  Rental income generated by this group has typically exceeded the holding costs of the respective properties.  The majority of the rental properties are listed for sale with real estate agents; however, properties in this group are not the primary focus of management s marketing efforts given the income producing nature of the property.  The Company s OREO that is classified as auction properties are marketed aggressively with dates set for auctions and most auction properties being allowed to sell without a reserve price.  The Company s other OREO properties are being marketed, though there is no definite date as to when they may be expected to be sold. 
 The following table provides activity within the OREO portfolio in terms of individual parcels for the nine-month and three-month periods ended on the dates indicated:

FINANCIAL CONDITION   (Continued)  
 The following table sets forth information related to the five largest OREO properties held by the Company as of September 30, 2016: 

The following table sets forth information related to the five largest OREO properties held by the Company as of December 31, 2015: 

(1)   
 
 These two properties were pledged as collateral for the same loan relationship.    

 Each of the OREO properties identified in the September 30, 2016 table above is listed with a real estate agent and is also listed as available for sale on the Bank s website.  The two properties classified as unimproved land were, at the time the loans were made, intended to be developed.  The property carried at $1,828 is commercial property located in an area that remains significantly and negatively impacted by the downturn in the real estate market.  The property is currently under contract; however, there is a lengthy due diligence period and the sale of the property may not ultimately be consummated.  If so, the Company will continue to actively market the property.  The property carried at $799 is located in a residential area that was also negatively impacted by the downturn in the economy.  Although there are some positive indicators of improvements in the local market where the property is located, management believes it will likely require a significant amount of time to sell the property and will continue to market the property.  The commercial real estate property carried at $782 consists of income producing rental property that is being managed by a third party property manager on behalf of the Company.  The Company continues to market this rental property, but because of the income producing nature of the property, it is likely that management will resist selling the property in the near term for less than the current carrying value of the property.  The commercial real estate property carried at $323 consists of income producing rental property that is currently under a purchase contract and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The commercial property carried at $315 is a commercial/industrial building in an area that was also negatively impacted by the downturn of the economy.  Due to the deteriorated condition of the property, limited demand, and potential environmental risk, management believes it will likely require a significant amount of time to sell the property. 
 Deposits 
 The Company relies on the Bank s deposit growth, as well as alternative funding sources such as other borrowed money, Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks, to fund its operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION   (Continued)  
 The following table sets forth the composition of the deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The following table sets forth all time deposits greater than $100 broken down by remaining maturity at September 30, 2016: 

Total deposits were $418,716 at September 30, 2016, compared to $416,714 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $2,002.  The increase was primarily due to increases in noninterest-bearing deposits offset in part by decreases in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
 Shareholders  Equity 
 At September 30, 2016, shareholders  equity totaled $30,207, an increase of $7,242, or 31.5%, from $22,965 at December 31, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to forgiveness of Series A Preferred Stock dividends during the first three months of 2016 and net income for the first nine months of 2016. 
 On February 25, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved amendments to the Company s charter that canceled the amount of the accumulated but undeclared dividends in respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and reduce the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock from $1,000 per share to $650 per share.  These changes resulted in $4,265 of dividends being reversed, which reduced the Company s accumulated deficit.  The reduction in liquidation value transferred $4,167 of capital from Series A Preferred Stock to Common Stock.  On June 30, 2016, all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into 1,629,097 shares of Common Stock. 
 At the request of the FRB-Atlanta, the Board of Directors of the Company, on January 18, 2011, adopted a board resolution (which was replaced by the Written Agreement that was terminated on February 29, 2016) agreeing that the Company would not, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends on any of its common stock or preferred stock, or redeem treasury stock without approval from the FRB-Atlanta.  The Company requested permission to make dividend payments on its preferred stock and interest payments on its subordinated debentures that were scheduled for the first quarter of 2011.  In the first quarter of 2011, the FRB-Atlanta granted the Company permission to pay the dividends on its preferred stock that were due on February 15, 2011, but denied the Company permission to make interest payments on its subordinated debentures.  As a result of the FRB-Atlanta s decision, the Company was required to begin the deferral of interest payments on each of its three issuances of subordinated debentures during the first quarter of 2011.  The Company has the right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time, for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters.  During the period in which it is deferring the payment of interest on its subordinated debentures, the indentures governing the subordinated debentures provide that the Company cannot pay any dividends on its Common Stock or preferred stock.  Accordingly, the Company was required to suspend its dividend payments on its preferred stock beginning in the second quarter of 2011.  On February 29, 2016, the Company was notified by the FRB-Atlanta that the Written Agreement had been terminated as of that date.  The Company received permission from the FRB-Atlanta to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends on its subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter of 2015 and made these payments in December 2015.  The Company made all interest payments due on its subordinated debentures in the first nine months of 2016. 
 On April 28, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1, with the SEC relating to a proposed public offering of up to 250,000 shares of its Common Stock in connection with a rights offering (the  Rights Offering ).  The Company completed the Rights Offering on September 27, 2016.  The Company received subscriptions and over-subscriptions for a total of 40,528 shares of its Common Stock.  All of the subscriptions and over-subscriptions were accepted, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $193.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Net Income 
 The Company had net income of $2,062 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $4,219 for the same period in 2015, a decrease in net income of $2,157. This decrease was primarily due to a combination of a decrease in the reversal of provision for loan loss and the Company beginning to recognize income tax in the first quarter of 2016, when no income tax was recognized in the comparable period in 2015.  Net income available to common shareholders was $6,230 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $2,283 for the same period in 2015.  This increase was primarily due to the forgiveness of $4,265 of Series A Preferred Stock accrued dividends in the first quarter of 2016. 
 The Company had net income of $634 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $1,778 for the same period in 2015, a decrease in net income of $1,144. Net income available to common shareholders was $537 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $676 for the same period in 2015.  These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in the reversal of provision for loan loss and an increase in income tax expense, similar to the factors impacting the Company s net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (Continued)  
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income for the first nine months of 2016 was $10,906, an increase of $240, or 2.3%, compared to $10,666 for the same period in 2015. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase in income from federal funds sold and other and taxable securities available for sale combined with a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures. 
 Total interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12,980, an increase of $52 from $12,928 for the same period in 2015. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in income from federal funds sold and other and taxable securities available for sale as a result of increases in the rate earned on time deposits in other financial institutions and securties balances outstanding.  These increases were offset in part by a decrease in income from loans.  
 The average rate earned on gross loans in the first nine months of 2016 was 5.14% compared to 5.66% for the same period in 2015. The decrease in income from loans was due to a decrease in the average rate earned on loans offset by an increase in the average balance of loans.  The decrease in the average rate earned on loans was due to collection of significant interest recoveries on loans during the first three months of 2015 that were formerly on nonaccrual status and not repeated in 2016.  Management is seeing some pressure on rates for some loan types, which is contributing to the decrease in loan yields; however, the majority of the decrease is related to the prior year recoveries.  The increase in the average balance of loans was due to increased loan demand that continued in the first nine months of 2016.   
 Interest income on taxable securities increased $71 to $1,526 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1,455 in the first nine months of 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average rate earned on taxable securities offset in part by a decrease in the average balance of taxable securities. 
 Total interest expense was $2,074 in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $188 from $2,262 in the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the rate paid on the Company s subordinated debentures in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease in the rate paid on the Company s subordinated debentures is due primarily to the lack of compounding of interest on deferred interest payments since accrued expense on these debentures is now current. 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,676, a decrease of $359, or 8.9%, compared to $4,035 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net interest income is primarily due to a decrease in income from loans combined with a decrease in income on taxable securities available for sale combined with a decrease in interest expense paid on subordinated debentures, similar to factors noted above for the first nine months of 2016. 
 Total interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,384, a decrease of $517, or 10.5%, from $4,901 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease in income from loans and income from taxable securities available for sale.  The decrease in interest income on loans is for reasons similar to factors noted above for the first nine months of 2016.  The decrease in interest income from taxable securities available for sale is due to a decrease in the average balance of securities available for sale. 
 Total interest expense was $708 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $158 from $866 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the rate paid on the Company s subordinated debentures in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, similar to factors noted above for the first nine months of 2016.   
 Provisions for Loan Losses 
 In the first nine months of 2016, the Bank reversed $903 of the allowance for loan loss as a result of improvements in asset quality and significant loan recoveries. In the first nine months of 2015, the Bank reversed $2,257 of the allowance for loan loss. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank reversed $325 of the allowance for loan loss compared to $694 in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans was 1.15% at September 30, 2016 compared to 1.62% at December 31, 2015. 
 Management s determination of the appropriate level of the provision for loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based, in part, on an evaluation of specific loans, as well as the consideration of historical loss experience, which management believes is representative of probable incurred loan losses. Other factors considered by management include the composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, reviews of updated real estate appraisals, and the creditworthiness of the Bank s borrowers and other qualitative factors. 
 - 47 - 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (Continued)  
 Nonperforming loans decreased from $7,266 at December 31, 2015 to $2,375 at September 30, 2016. The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily due to several large loans previously classified as troubled debt restructurings becoming reclassified as performing. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was 146.02% at September 30, 2016, compared to 58.84% at December 31, 2015. The portion of the allowance attributable to impaired loans was $92 at September 30, 2016 compared to $340 at December 31, 2015. Total impaired loans were $1,350 at September 30, 2016 compared to $7,964 at December 31, 2015.  This decrease is mainly due to loan relationships that were previously classified as troubled debt restructurings that either refinanced into new loans or no longer met the regulatory definition of a troubled debt restructuring. 
 The portion of the allowance attributable to historical and environmental factors has decreased since December 31, 2015. Management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses, in addition to specific loan allocations, is based on volume of non-impaired loans and changes in credit quality and environmental factors. The improvement in the portion of the allowance attributable to historical and environmental factors occurred during the first nine months of 2016 due to improvement in credit quality and environmental factors. 
 Problem loans that are not impaired are categorized into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Watch. Loans characterized by borrowers who have marginal cash flow, marginal profitability, or have experienced operating losses and declining financial condition. The borrower has satisfactorily handled debts with the Bank in the past, but in recent months has either been late, delinquent in making payments, or made sporadic payments. While the Bank continues to be adequately secured, the borrower s margins have decreased or are decreasing, despite the borrower s continued satisfactory condition. Other characteristics of borrowers in this class include inadequate credit information, weakness of financial statement and repayment capacity, but with collateral that appears to limit the Bank s exposure. This classification includes loans to established borrowers that are reasonably margined by collateral, but where potential for improvement in financial capacity is limited. 
 Special Mention. Loans with potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deteriorating prospects for the repayment source or in the Bank s credit position in the future. 
 Substandard. Loans inadequately protected by the payment capacity of the borrower or the pledged collateral. 
 Doubtful. Loans with the same characteristics as substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collectability in full in a reasonable period of time or evidence of permanent impairment in the collateral securing the loan. 
 Impaired loans are evaluated separately from other loans in the Bank s portfolio. Credit quality information related to impaired loans was presented above and is excluded from the tables below. 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by segment of loans is as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (Continued)  

The table below illustrates changes in the AFLL ratio (the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the allowance for loan losses to total gross loans) over the past five quarters and the changes in related risk metrics over the same periods: 

(1)   
 
 Historical and environmental component as a percentage of non-impaired loans.    

(2)   
 
 Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 or more days still accruing interest, and troubled debt restructurings still accruing interest as a percentage of gross loans.    

(3)   
 
 Annualized.    

 Interest income on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 
 The following table presents information regarding loans included as nonaccrual and troubled debt restructurings and the gross income that would have been recorded in the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 if the loans had been current: 

Noninterest Income 
 Total noninterest income for the first nine months of 2016 was $2,183, an increase of $372, or 20.5% from $1,811 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sale of securities available for sale, service charges on deposit accounts and gain on sale of loans. 
 Gains on sale of securities available for sale for the first nine months of 2016 was $206, an increase of $201 from $5 for the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to the Company choosing to sell securities to fund loan growth and to take advantage of favorable market conditions during the first nine months of 2016. 
 - 49 - 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (Continued)  
 Service charges on deposit accounts for the first nine months of 2016 was $1,422, an increase of $95, or 7.2%, from $1,327 for the same period in 2015. This was primarily a result of an increase in interchange fees received due to more debit card usage by our customers. 
 Gain on sale of loans for the first nine months of 2016 was $139, an increase of $71, or 95.8%, from $68 for the same period in 2015. This was primarily a result of an increase in mortgage banking activity during the first nine months of 2016. 
 Total noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $675, an increase of $61, or 9.9% from $614 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sale of securities available for sale and service charges on deposit accounts, similar to factors noted above for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 
 The table below shows noninterest income for the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $10,721, an increase of $206, or 2.0%, from $10,515 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, other expense, director expense, and ATM expense offset by decreases in regulatory and compliance expense, other real estate expense and insurance expense. 
 Salaries and employee benefits totaled $5,642 in the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $421, or 8.1%, from $5,221 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a bonus paid to members of executive management combined with a significant increase in an incentive paid to loan officers due to increased loan production. 
 Other expense totaled $305 in the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $135, or 79.4%, from $170 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in the use of outside services for strategic consulting and executive compensation consulting. 
 Director expense totaled $293 in the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $119, or 68.4%, from $174 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to changes in the director fee schedule that became effective in the first quarter of 2016. 
 ATM expenses totaled $592 in the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $67, or 12.8%, from $525 for the same period in 2015.  This increase was primarily the result of a change in interchange fees paid by the Bank that occurred in the later part of 2015. 
 Other real estate expense totaled $206 for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $197, or 48.9%, from $403 for the same period in 2015. Other real estate expense decreased during the first nine months of 2016 as a result of fewer properties being sold at a loss and fewer properties experiencing writedowns as a result of stabilization of real estate prices. 
 Regulatory and compliance expense totaled $301 in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $219, or 42.1%, from $520 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the Bank s FDIC insurance expense premium as a result of the lifting of all regulatory orders. 
 Insurance expense totaled $141 in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $93, or 39.7%, from $234 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the Bank s corporate insurance expense premium as a result of the lifting of all regulatory orders.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (Continued)  
 Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,656, an increase of $91, or 2.6%, from $3,565 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, other expense and director expense offset by decreases in other real estate expense, regulatory and compliance expense and insurance expense, similar to factors noted above for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 
 The table below shows noninterest expense for the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate was 36.96% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 37.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 0.0% for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Due to economic condition and losses recognized between 2008 and 2011, the Company established a valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the asset can be realized through current and future taxable income.  As a result, the Company was able to reinstate all of its unrecognized deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The Company has approximately $49,442 in net operating losses for state tax purposes and $21,619 for federal tax purposes to be utilized by future earnings as of September 30, 2016. 
 The Company currently has no unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the income tax rate in future periods.  The Company does not expect any unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease during the remainder of 2016.  It is the Company s policy to recognize any interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense, with any penalties recognized as operating expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards of $21,619 and $49,442, respectively, which will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2035. Such NOL carryforwards expire as follows:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 Liquidity refers to the Company s ability to fund loan demand, meet deposit customers  withdrawal needs and provide for operating expenses. As summarized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Bank s main source of cash flow is from receiving deposits from its customers and, to a lesser extent, repayment of loan principal and interest income on loans and investments, FHLB advances, the possible sale or pledge of investment securities, and federal funds purchased. 
 The Bank s primary uses of cash are lending to its borrowers and investing in securities and short-term interest-earning assets. During the first nine months of 2016, loan growth has outpaced deposit growth, and management believes this trend will continue throughout the remainder of 2016. In addition to funding loan growth, management plans to continue to utilize excess liquidity to invest in securities available for sale and time deposits in other financial institutions. 
 As a result of improvements in the Bank s and the Company s financial condition, management sought approval from its regulators to allow the Bank to pay dividends to the Company in an amount sufficient to allow the Company to pay all accrued but unpaid interest payments on its subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of 2015.  The Company received all of the required regulatory approvals and in December 2015 made interest payments totaling $5,444 to the holders of the subordinated debt.  The Company also made its scheduled interest payment on its subordinated debentures in each of the three quarters of 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was current on all interest payments due related to its subordinated debentures.  The Company has the right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time, for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters.  During the period in which it is deferring the payment of interest on its subordinated debentures, the indentures governing the subordinated debentures provide that the Company cannot pay any dividends on its Common Stock or preferred stock.   
   Also during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company and Bank received permission for the Bank to pay additional dividends to the Company sufficient to allow it to redeem certain holders of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock and fully redeem the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the  Series B Preferred Stock ).  On December 23, 2015, the Company entered into redemption agreements with certain of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock who collectively held 5,901 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.  The Company agreed to pay $600 per share to redeem the shares.  The shares were redeemed on December 31, 2015.  Upon redemption, $2,360 of the Company s equity that was attributable to the redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock was transferred to common equity as a result of the cash redemption amount being less than the face value of the redeemed shares.  Due to the restrictions on the Company s ability to pay dividends, a total of $2,114 of dividends had been accrued as of the redemption date for the 5,901 shares that were redeemed.  Upon redemption, the accrued dividends were reversed, which reduced the amount of the Company s accumulated deficit. 
 Also during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company redeemed all of its Series B Preferred Stock for full face value and accrued dividends.  The Company paid a total of $1,374 for the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. 
 As a result of these redemptions, at December 31, 2015 the Company had accumulated $4,265 in deferred dividends on the 11,905 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock that were not redeemed.  As a result of the Charter Amendments approved by the Company s shareholders in the first quarter of 2016 that modified the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, these deferred dividends were reversed in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in a further reduction of a like amount to the Company s accumulated deficit.   
 On April 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Conversion Agreement (the  Conversion Agreement ) that provided for the conversion of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock, having a liquidation preference of $650 per share, into shares of the Company s Common Stock.  Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, each holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, including the Company s directors and executive officers that owned such shares, had each share of his or her Series A Preferred Stock converted into approximately 137 shares of Common Stock (the  Conversion Shares ) effective June 30, 2016, representing an effective conversion price for each share of Common Stock of $4.75.  Under the terms of the Conversion Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,629,097 shares of Common Stock to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.  The issuance of the Conversion Shares was approved by the Company s board of directors and separately by the members of the board of directors that did not own any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.   
 On April 28, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC relating to a proposed public offering of up to 250,000 shares of its Common Stock pursuant to the Rights Offering.  The Company commenced the Rights Offering on August 12, 2016 and closed it on September 27, 2016.  The Company received subscriptions and over-subscriptions for a total of 40,528 shares of its Common Stock.  All of the subscriptions and over-subscriptions were accepted, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $193.  The Company intends to utilize the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes.

LIQUIDIT  Y AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   (Continued)  
 Following termination of the informal agreement the Bank had entered into with the FDIC and the Department, the Bank is no longer subject to restrictions from the Department on its ability to pay dividends to the Company (other than the restrictions under applicable Tennessee law limiting the amount of dividends a bank incorporated under the laws of the state of Tennessee may pay to its shareholders to the current year s net income and any retained net income for the prior two years).  At September 30, 2016, the Bank could dividend up to $12,619 to the Company, without the consent of the Commissioner of the Department or the FDIC. 
 In late 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued  Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems  ( Basel III ), a new capital framework for banks and bank holding companies. Basel III imposes a stricter definition of capital, with more focus on common equity for those banks to which it is applicable. In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, adopted final rules that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel III and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules, which became effective January 1, 2015, apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1,000,000 or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies ( banking organizations ). Among other things, the rules established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement of 6% (up from 4%), a total risk-based capital requirement of 8% and a Tier 1 leverage capital requirement of 4%.  In addition, the rules assign higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status.  In order to be considered  well-capitalized , the Bank must maintain at least the following minimum capital ratios: common equity Tier 1 capital of 6.5%; tier 1 risked-based capital of 8% (up from 6%); total risk-based capital of 10%; and tier 1 leverage capital of 5%.  The rules limit a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments as well as a banking organization s ability to repurchase its own shares if the banking organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of an additional 2.5% of capital (when the buffer is fully phased in) in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As a result, when fully phased in, the capital requirements, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, would be a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a Tier 1 common risk-based equity capital ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 equity risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.  Beginning on January 1, 2016, 0.625% of the capital conservation buffer had been phased in. Under the rules Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions, cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities (including associated subordinated debentures) issued after May 19, 2010 will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 (like our subordinated debentures) will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain quantitative limitations.  Our Series A Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015 and continued to qualify as Tier 1 capital until it was converted to Common Stock pursuant to the Conversion Agreement.  Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.  The final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250,000,000 in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  We and the Bank have opted out.  Because the Company s total consolidated assets are below $1,000,000, these capital rules are not applicable to the Company on a consolidated basis.  Should the Company s total consolidated assets increase to more than $1,000,000, the Company would then be subject to these rules. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $32,511 and unfunded letters of credit of $1,212. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If the Company needed to fund these outstanding commitments, it has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available for sale or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. Additionally, the Company could sell participations in these or other loans to correspondent banks.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   (Continued)  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank s and the Company s risk-based capital ratios and the minimums to be considered  well-capitalized  under regulatory guidelines were as follows: 

At its current capital ratios, the Bank is considered  well capitalized . Because the Company s total assets were less than $1,000,000 at September 30, 2016, it is not subject to capital requirements on a consolidated basis. Despite improvements in our consolidated capital levels, a significant portion of our capital on a consolidated basis consists of subordinated debentures which require repayments. 
 Management continually monitors the Bank s sources and uses of cash in order to plan for future liquidity needs. The Bank s most potentially volatile funding liabilities are national market time deposits. The Bank reduced its reliance on these funding sources during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016.  The Bank s national market CDs totaled $3,720 at September 30, 2016 and $5,855 at December 31, 2015. Management is currently utilizing national market CDs to take advantage of the favorable rates in that sector of the deposit market.

ITEM 3.   
 
        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT  IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     

 Management uses a gap simulation model that takes cash flows into consideration. These include mortgage-backed securities, loan prepayments, and expected calls on securities. Non-maturing balances such as money markets, savings, and negotiable order of withdrawal ( NOW ) accounts have no contractual or stated maturities. A challenge in the rate risk analysis is to determine the impact of the non-maturing balances on the net interest margin as the interest rates change. Because these balances do not  mature  it is difficult to know how they will reprice as rates change. It is possible to glean some understanding by reviewing our pricing history on these categories relative to interest rates. Using the interest rate history from the Asset Liability Management software database spanning up to 20 quarters of data, we can derive the relationship between interest rates changes and the offering rates themselves. The analysis uses the T-Bill rate as an indicator of rate changes. The gap analysis uses beta factors to spread balances to reflect repricing speed. In the gap analysis the model considers deposit rate movements to determine what percentage of interest-bearing deposits that is actually repriceable within a year. Our cumulative one year gap position at September 30, 2016, was 0.80% of total assets. Our policy states that our one-year cumulative gap should not exceed 15% of total assets. 
 At September 30, 2016, $159,066 of $472,304 of interest earning assets will reprice or mature within one year. Loans maturing or repricing within one year totaled $102,066, or 34.1% of total loans, including loans held for sale at September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had $123,859 in time deposits maturing or repricing within one year. 
 Gap analysis only shows the dollar volume of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice. It does not provide information on how frequently they will reprice. To more accurately capture the Company s interest rate risk, we measure the actual effects the repricing opportunities have on earnings through income simulation models such as rate shocks of economic value of equity and rate shock interest income simulations. 
 To truly evaluate the impact of rate change on income, we believe the rate shock simulation of interest income is the best technique because variables are changed for the various rate conditions. The interest income change in each category of earning assets and liabilities is calculated as rates move up and down. In addition, the prepayment speeds and repricing speeds are changed. Rate shock is a method for stress testing the net interest margin over the next four quarters under several rate change levels. These levels span four 100 basis point increments up and down from the current interest rate. Our policy guideline is that the maximum percentage change in net interest income cannot exceed plus or minus 15% on a 200 basis point interest rate change. 
 Although interest rates are currently very low, the Company believes a -200 basis point rate shock is an effective and realistic test since interest rates on many of the Company's loans still have the ability to decline 200 basis points. For those loans that have floors above the -200 basis point rate shock, the interest rate would be at the floor rate. All deposit account rates would likely fall to their floors under the -200 basis point rate shock as well. This simulation analysis assumes that NOW and savings accounts have a lower correlation to changes in market interest rates than do loans, securities, and time deposits. 

Our economic value of equity simulation measures our long-term interest rate risk. The economic value is the difference between the market value of the assets and the liabilities and, technically, it is our liquidation. 
 - 55 - 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   (Continued)  
 The technique is to apply rate changes and compute the value. The slope of the change between shock levels is a measure of the volatility of value risk. The slope is called duration. The greater the slope, the greater the impact or rate change on our long-term performance. Our policy guideline is that the maximum percentage change on economic value of equity cannot exceed plus or minus 10% on 100 basis point change and 20% on 200 basis point change. The following illustrates our equity at risk in the economic value of equity model. 

One of management s objectives in managing our balance sheet for interest rate sensitivity is to reduce volatility in the net interest margin by matching, as closely as possible, the timing of the repricing of its interest rate sensitive assets with interest rate sensitive liabilities. 

ITEM 4.   
 
     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

 The Company, with the participation of its management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on their evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

   6.   Adjustment to Option Stock  .

   9.   Reservation of Shares  .  At all times during the term of this Option, the Company shall use its best efforts to reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement.

   6.   Adjustment to Option Stock  .  The Committee may make equitable and proportionate adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, this Option in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (and shall make the adjustments for the events described in   Section 4.2   of the Plan) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles in accordance with the Plan, whenever the Committee determines that such event(s) affect the Shares.

   9.   Reservation of Shares  .  At all times during the term of this Option, the Company shall use its best efforts to reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement.  
   10.   Plan Governs  .  The Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of (or electronic link to) the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof.

Exhibit 10.9 
 COMMUNITY FIRST, INC. 
   INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT 
 (Officers and Employees) 
   
   THIS INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT  (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of this ____ day of _____________, 20__ (the  Grant Date ), by and between Community First, Inc. a Tennessee corporation (together with its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the  Company ), and the individual identified on the signature page hereto (the  Optionee ).  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Community First, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).   
   
   WHEREAS , the Company has adopted the Plan, which permits the issuance of stock options for the purchase of shares of the common stock, no par value per share, of the Company (the  Shares  and  
   
   WHEREAS , the Company desires to afford the Optionee an opportunity to purchase Shares as hereinafter provided in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.  
   
   NOW, THEREFORE , in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:  
   1.   Grant of Option  .  
   (a)   The Company grants as of the date of this Agreement the right and option (the  Option ) to purchase __________ Shares, in whole or in part (the  Option Stock ), at an exercise price of ___________________________________ and No/100 Dollars ($_________) per Share, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and subject to all provisions of the Plan.  The Optionee, holder or beneficiary of the Option shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Option Stock until such person has become a holder of such Shares by the due exercise of the Option and payment of the Option Payment (as defined in   Section 3   below) in accordance with this Agreement.  
     (b)   The parties intend that the Option qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and this Agreement shall be interpreted consistently therewith.  In the event a portion or all of this Option does not so qualify, the parties intend that the nonqualifying portion shall remain valid and outstanding and shall instead be treated as a non-qualified stock option.   Accordingly, the Optionee understands that in order to obtain the benefits of an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, no sale or other disposition may be made of Option Stock for which incentive stock option treatment is desired within the one year period beginning on the day after the day of the transfer of such Option Stock to the Optionee, nor within the two year period beginning on the day after the grant of this Option, and further that this Option must be exercised within three months after termination of employment as an employee (or 12 months in the case of death or Disability) in order to qualify as an incentive stock option.  If the Optionee disposes (whether by sale, gift, transfer or  

otherwise) of any such Option Stock within either of these periods, the Optionee will notify the Company within 30 days after such disposition.    In order comply with all applicable federal, state or local tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state or other taxes are withheld or collected from the Optionee.  
   2.   Exercise of Option  .  
 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, this Option shall become vested and exercisable as set forth below, if and only if the Optionee shall have been continuously employed by the Company from the date of this Agreement through and including such dates:  

Percentage of Restricted Shares   
 
        Date   

__________  
 
 __________  

__________  
 
 __________  

__________  
 
 __________  

__________  
 
 __________  

(b) Notwithstanding the above, this Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 100% of the Option Stock in the event of the Optionee s death or Disability, provided the Optionee has remained continuously employed by the Company from the date of this Agreement to such event.  
 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control, this Option shall become vested and exercisable (but only to the extent such Option has not otherwise terminated) with respect to 100% of the Option Stock immediately prior to the Change in Control.  
     3.   Manner of Exercise  .  The Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time within the period permitted hereunder for the exercise of the Option, with respect to whole Shares only, by serving written notice of intent to exercise the Option delivered to the Company at its principal office (or to the Company s designated agent), stating the number of Shares to be purchased, the person or persons in whose name the Shares are to be registered and each such person s address and social security number.  Such notice shall not be effective unless accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is then being exercised (the  Option Payment ) and, except as otherwise provided herein, cash equal to the required withholding taxes as set forth by Internal Revenue Service and applicable state and local tax guidelines for the employer s minimum statutory withholding (the  Witholding Taxes ).  The Option Payment shall be made (a) in cash or cash equivalents, (b) by transfer, either actually or by attestation, to the Company of whole Shares previously acquired by the Optionee and valued at the Shares  Fair Market Value on the date of exercise (or next succeeding trading date if the date of exercise is not a trading date), or by a combination of such cash (or cash equivalents) and Shares, or (c) by directing the Company to withhold that number of whole Shares otherwise deliverable to the Optionee pursuant to the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the Option Payment and, in the Committee s discretion, a Fair Market Value equal to the amount necessary   
 2 

to satisfy any Witholding Taxes not otherwise paid in cash or cash equivalents.  Subject to applicable securities laws and the consent of the Committee, the Optionee may also exercise the Option by delivering a notice of exercise of the Option and by simultaneously selling the Shares of Option Stock thereby acquired pursuant to a brokerage or similar agreement approved in advance by proper officers of the Company, using the proceeds of such sale as payment of the Option Payment, together with any applicable Withholding Taxes  .  
   4.   Termination of Option  .  The Option will expire ten (10) years from the date of grant of the Option (the  Term ) with respect to any then unexercised portion thereof, unless terminated earlier as set forth below:  
   (a)   Termination by Death  .  If the Optionee s employment by the Company terminates by reason of death, this Option may thereafter be exercised,  to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination  (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting provided for in   Section 2   above) ,  by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of the Optionee under the will of the Optionee, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of death or until the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.  
   (b)   Termination by Reason of Disability  .  If the Optionee s employment by the Company terminates by reason of Disability, this Option may thereafter be exercised, to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination   (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting provided for in   Section 2   above),   by the Optionee or personal representative or guardian of the Optionee, as applicable, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such termination of employment or until the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.  
   (c)   Termination by Retirement  .  If the Optionee s employment by the Company terminates by reason of Retirement, this Option may thereafter be exercised by the Optionee,  to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination  for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of such termination of employment or until the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.  
   (d)   Termination for Cause  .  If the Optionee s employment by the Company is terminated for Cause, this Option shall terminate immediately and become void and of no effect.  
     (e)   Other Termination    .  If the Optionee s employment by the Company terminates for any reason other than for Cause, death, Disability or Retirement, this Option may be exercised, to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination by the Optionee for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of such termination of employment or the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.  
   5.   No Right to Continued Employment  .  The grant of the Option shall not be construed as giving the Optionee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company, and the Company may at any time dismiss the Optionee from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan.  
     6.   Adjustment to Option Stock  .  The Committee may make equitable and proportionate adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, this Option   
 3 

in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (and shall make the adjustments for the events described in   Section 4.2   of the Plan) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles in accordance with the Plan, whenever the Committee determines that such event(s) affect the Shares.  Any such adjustments shall be effected in a manner that precludes the material enlargement of rights and benefits under this Award.  
   7.   Amendments to Option  .  Subject to the restrictions contained in the Plan, the Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate, the Option, prospectively or retroactively; provided that any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the Optionee or any holder or beneficiary of the Option shall not to that extent be effective without the consent of the Optionee, holder or beneficiary affected.  
   8.   Limited Transferability  .  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, during the Optionee s lifetime, this Option can be exercised only by the Optionee, and this Option may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, and in the case of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern.  
   11.   Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement is, or becomes, or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or the Award, or would disqualify the Plan or Award under any laws deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and Award shall remain in full force and effect.
