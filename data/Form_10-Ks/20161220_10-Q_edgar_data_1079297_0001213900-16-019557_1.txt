Note
1. Financial Statement Presentation   

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim information and in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and
they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 (the  Annual Report ). The accompanying interim financial
statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the six month period ended October 31, 2016,
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2017.  

Basis
of Presentation  

The
Company s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Annual Report. These accounting policies conform
to U.S.GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the six months ended October 31, 2016, and the Company does
not expect the adoption, as applicable, of other recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial
statements.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company records convertible debt and warrants at fair value on a recurring basis.  Estimated fair values of the Company's
convertible debt and derivatives liability were calculated based upon quoted market prices. See Notes 8 and 9.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended October 31, 2016, have been prepared
on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business. The Company will require additional funding to execute its future strategic business plan. Successful business
operations and its transition to attaining profitability are dependent upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level
of revenue adequate to support its cost structure. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of management s plans and the Company s
ability to use its common stock to raise working capital. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities in the event management s plans are not successful.  

The
Company will continue to incur costs that are necessary for it to remain an active public company. In the current fiscal year,
the Company used approximately $248,000 of cash to support its operations and such cash needs are expected to continue in the
upcoming year.  As of October 31, 2016, the Company has approximately $30,000 in cash.

Note
8. Fair Value Measurement    

The
Company utilizes the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and discloses for all financial assets and liabilities that
are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis during the reporting period.  

The
fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The Company utilizes market data or assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ,
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These tiers
are defined as follows:    

Level 1 -   
      Observable inputs
    such as quoted market prices in active markets.   

Level 2 -   
      Inputs other than
    quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.   

Level 3 -   
      Unobservable inputs
    about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.   

As
of October 31, 2016, the Company held certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These
consisted of convertible debt totaling $34,270 and $0 with a derivative liability totaling $168,983 (including stock warrants)
and $0 at October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are categorized as Level 3. The related gain on derivatives totaled $16,660
for the six month period ended October 31, 2016. Gain on derivatives totaled $5,777 for the six month period ended October 31,
2015.

Note 9
- Derivative Liabilities   

During
the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company identified conversion features embedded within its convertible debt. See Note
10. The Company has determined that the conversion feature of the Hoppel convertible note represents an embedded derivative since
the Note is convertible into a variable number of shares upon conversion. Accordingly, the Note is not considered to be conventional
debt and the embedded conversion feature must be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. The
Hoppel convertible note tainted all other convertible instruments (Tangier convertible notes and all warrants) and these convertible
instruments were treated as derivatives as well. Therefore, the fair value of the derivative instruments has been recorded as
liabilities on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as discounts to the Notes. Such discounts will be accreted
from the issuance date to the maturity date of the Notes. The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities will be recorded
in other income or expenses in the statement of operations at the end of each period, with the offset to the derivative liabilities
on the balance sheet. The fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities on the convertible notes were determined using a multinomial
lattice models on the issuance dates with the assumptions in the table below. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using
a Black-Scholes valuation model.  

The
fair value of the Company s derivative liabilities at October 31, 2016 is as follows:  

The
fair values at the commitment dates and remeasurement dates for the convertible debt and warrants treated as derivative liabilities
are based upon the following estimates and assumptions made by management for the six months ended October 31, 2016:  

The
stock prices ranged from $0.0198 to $0.0114 in this periods would fluctuate with the Company projected volatility;  

An
event of default for the Convertible Note would occur 0% of the time, increasing 0.5% per month to a maximum of 5%;  

Alternative
financing for the Convertible Notes would be initially available to redeem the note 0% of the time and increase monthly by 1%
to a maximum of 10%;  

The
Holder would automatically convert (limited by trading volume and ownership limits of 4.99% to 9.99%) the note starting after
180 days if the company was not in default.  

The
projected annual volatility for each valuation period was based on the historical volatility of the company and the remaining
term of the instrument and ranged from 160% to 306%.  

The
risk-free rates were based on the remaining term of the instrument and ranged from 0.51% to 1.84%.

10. Financing Agreement and Convertible Debentures   

Tangiers
Convertible Note and Financing Agreement   

On August 25, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and
Restated 5.83% Fixed Convertible Promissory Note with Tangiers Global, LLC ( Tangiers convertible note ). This note
amended the previously entered into 5.83% Fixed Convertible Promissory Note dated June 23, 2016 in the principal amount of $22,000
including an original issue discount in the amount of $2,000. This convertible note is due and payable on June 23, 2017 with guaranteed
interest of 5.83% of the principal amount. This note is convertible at the election of the Holder from time to time after the issuance
date. The note converts at $0.03. Conversion is limited such that the holder cannot exceed 9.99% beneficial ownership. In the event
of default, the amount of principal not paid is subject to a default interest rate of 15% and a default penalty of 35%.

ITEM
    2.   
       MANAGEMENT'S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report.  

Certain
statements contained in this report, including, without limitation, statements containing the words  believes,   anticipates, 
 expects  and words of similar import, constitute  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,
including our ability to create, sustain, manage or forecast our growth; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; changes
in our business strategy or development plans; competition; business disruptions; adverse publicity; and international, national
and local general economic and market conditions.  

GENERAL   

Throughout
this Form 10-Q, the terms  we,   us,   our,   ProGreen  and the  Company 
refer to Progreen US, Inc., a Delaware corporation and, unless the context indicates otherwise, includes our subsidiaries.  

The
Company was incorporated in Florida on April 23, 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware on December 12, 2008. Effective September
11, 2009, we changed our name from Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. to ProGreen Properties, Inc. to reflect the change in
our business operations to the purchase of income producing real estate assets, and changed our name effective July 22, 2016 to
Progreen US, Inc. to reflect initiation of development operations in Baja Mexico.  

On
December 6, 2016 we filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation
that reduced the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 1,500,000,000 to 950,000,000.  

OUR
BUSINESS    

The
purchase of a condominium unit on July 28, 2009 initiated our planned new business operations directed at purchasing income-producing
residential real estate apartment homes, condominiums and houses in the State of Michigan, where we believe favorable investment
opportunities exist based on current market conditions.  

Our
offices are located in Oakland County, Michigan. Our business model since our initial property purchases in 2009 has been to acquire,
refurbish and upgrade existing properties into more environmentally sustainable, energy efficient, comfortable and healthier living
spaces so that they meet standards that exceed what is often the norm for most single-family homes, condominiums and apartments.
Once a property has been acquired, refurbished and rented, the property would be put back on the market, but now with a favorable
environmental profile. In January 2015, ProGreen Construction LLC ( ProGreen Construction ) was formed as a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company to perform all construction and development services for properties which are held and being developed
by the Company.  

We
have expanded our real estate development operations to include Baja California, Mexico. On February 12, 2016, we signed a definitive
joint venture agreement with Inmobiliaria Contel S.R.L.C.V. for the first tract of land of approximately 300 acres for agriculture
use. In addition, we have formed Procon joint venture subsidiary. Procon will be the holding company for further non-agricultural
land and real estate developments. The company will be managed by a board of Managing Directors consisting of three members, of
which two will be representing Progreen and one representing Contel.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Three
months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended October 31, 2015   

During
the three months ended October 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately $ 164,000 compared to a net loss of approximately
$121,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. Revenue decreased approximately $94,000 in the three months ended October
31, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015.  

Rental
revenue increased to approximately $20,000 as compared to $0 during the three months ended October 31, 2015. The Company received
rental income on seven properties during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to none in the comparable prior period.  

Management
fee revenue decreased to $0 during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $4,000 in 2015 as the
Company managed no properties in the current fiscal three month period. Construction services revenues were $0 in the three months
ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $110,000 in 2015. The decrease is a result of the Company s acquisition
of ARG, for whom the fiscal 2015 construction services were provided.  

There
have been fluctuations in certain expenses in the three months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the three months ended October
31, 2015. In the three months ended October 31, 2016 cost of construction services decreased to $0 as compared to approximately
$96,000 in the three months ended October 31, 2015, as a result of the Company s acquisition of ARG, for whom the fiscal
2015 construction services cost were incurred.  

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately $34,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable
prior period mainly due to the following:  

Rental
property costs and depreciation expense increased approximately $14,000 and $6,000, respectively, for the three months ended October
31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period as a result of costs incurred in connection with the rental properties the
Company acquired from ARG in the last quarter of fiscal 2016.  

The
reserve for the guarantee relating to the sale of rental properties increased to $0, for the three months ended October 31, 2016
as compared to a credit of approximately $6,000 in the comparable prior period as a result of the reversal of the reserve upon
expiration of the guarantee period.  

Salary
expense increased approximately $12,000 during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period
due to the addition of an office manager in the current quarter.  

These
increases were partially offset by decreases in certain expenses:  

Office
rent expense and office expense decreased approximately $3,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the
comparable prior period due the Company s new office space lease and due to cost cutting measures.  

Auto
expense decreased approximately $1,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period
due to the reduction in the number of vehicles used by the Company.  

Professional
fees increased approximately $66,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period mainly
due to:  

Audit
and accounting fees increased approximately $33,000 in the three month period ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the prior
comparable quarter, mainly due to increased fees paid to our auditors and to our outside accountants due to the increased complexity
of accounting issues and regulatory compliance costs.  

An
increase in legal fees paid in the amount of approximately $20,000 in the three month period ended October 31, 2016 as a result
of our S-1 filing.  

An
increase in fees paid relating to investor relations and other expenses incurred as a result of our public company filings in
the amount of approximately $13,000 in the three month period ended October 31, 2016.  

Interest
expense, net decreased approximately $44,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period
mainly due to the decrease in amounts paid in connection with the AMREFA debt in the prior comparable quarter and the payoff of
the RF debenture in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  

Derivatives
gain increased to approximately $17,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to $6,000 for the comparable prior
period due to the fair value adjustments in connection with the convertible notes and common stock warrants in the current three
month period.  

Six
months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended October 31, 2015   

During
the six months ended October 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately $681,000 compared to a net loss of
approximately $269,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2015. Revenue decreased approximately $66,000 in the six months
ended October 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended October 31, 2015. Proceeds from the sale of properties increased to
$228,000 as compared to $0 during the six months ended October 31, 2015 and corresponding cost of properties sold increased
to approximately $186,000 as compared to $0 in the six months ended October 31, 2015, resulting in an increase in net gain
from sale of properties to approximately $42,000. The Company sold two properties in the six months ended October 31, 2016 as
compared to none in the comparable prior period.   

Rental
revenue increased to approximately $49,000 as compared to $0 during the six months ended October 31, 2015. The Company received
rental income on seven properties during the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to none in the comparable prior period.  

Commission
revenue increased to approximately $ 4,000 as compared to $0 during the six months ended October 31, 2015. The Company received
commissions on the sale of two properties in the six months ended October 31, 2016. There were no such commissions earned during
the six months ended October 31, 2015. Management fee revenue decreased to $0 during the six months ended October 31, 2016 as
compared to approximately $7,000 in 2015 as the Company managed no properties in the current fiscal six month period. Construction
services revenues were $0 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $152,000 in 2015. The decrease
is a result of the Company s acquisition of ARG, for whom the fiscal 2015 construction services were provided.  

There
have been fluctuations in certain expenses in the six months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the six months ended October
31, 2015. In the six months ended October 31, 2016 cost of construction services decreased to $0 as compared to approximately
$138,000 in the six months ended October 31, 2015, as a result of the Company s acquisition of ARG, for whom the fiscal
2015 construction services cost were incurred.  

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately $83,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable
prior period mainly due to the following:  

Rental
property costs and depreciation expense increased approximately $43,000 and $ 13,000, respectively, for the six months ended October
31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period as a result of costs incurred in connection with the rental properties the
Company acquired from ARG in the last quarter of fiscal 2016.  

Commission
expense increased approximately $7,100 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period as
a result of a commission paid on the sale of one of the properties.  

Travel
fees increased approximately $9,000, for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period as a
result of business travel to Mexico.  

Salary
expense increased approximately $22,000 in the current six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period
mainly due to the addition of an office manager and corrections to payroll tax expense.  

Compensation
expense increased approximately $3,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period due
to the vesting of a portion of restricted stock units.  

These
increases were partially offset by decreases in certain expenses:  

Office
rent expense decreased approximately $7,200 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period
due the Company s new office space lease.  

Office
expense and auto expense decreased approximately $5,100 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable
prior period due cost cutting measures.  

Professional
fees increased approximately $34,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period mainly
due to the following:  

Audit,
accounting and legal and fees increased approximately $71,000 mainly due to our S-1 filing, the increased complexity of accounting
issues and regulatory compliance costs.  

Investor
and OTC fees increased approximately $16,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior period.  

These
increases were partially offset due to fees paid with the issuance of common stock to two consultants in the amount of approximately
$53,000 in the six month period ended October 31, 2015.  

Interest
expense decreased to approximately $54,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to $94,000 for the comparable
prior period due to the reduction in debt and the amortization of prior period debt discounts.  

Loss
on settlement of liabilities, Series A increased to approximately $428,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared
to $0 for the comparable prior period due to the issuance of Series A preferred stock in settlement of the note payable to EIG
resulting in a loss in the amount of approximately $389,000 and in settlement of the advance due EIG resulting in a loss in the
amount of approximately $39,000.  

Gain
on settlement of liabilities, Series B increased to approximately $11,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared
to $0 for the comparable prior period due to the issuance of Series B preferred stock in settlement of the note payable due AMREFA.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

At
April 30, 2016, we had total assets of approximately $1,796,000 compared to total assets of approximately $1,838,000 at
October 31, 2016. The increase in total assets was primarily due to: Notes Receivable Land Contract which increased
approximately $206,000 due to the Company s issuance of land contracts to the buyers of the two properties sold in the
six month period ended October 31, 2016. Note Receivable- Related Party increased $195,000 as a result of the Company s
additional investment in Contel. Accounts receivable increased approximately $4,000 as a result of rental property rent due
from tenants as of October 31, 2016. Prepaid expenses increased approximately $2,000 due to the Company s prepayment of
legal fees in connection with SEC filings. These increases in assets were partially offset by a decrease in rental properties
of approximately $ 202,000, as a result of the sale of two properties in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and a decrease
in cash of approximately $160,000 in the six month period ended October 31, 2016  

Cash
decreased to approximately $30,000 for the period ended October 31, 2016, compared to cash of $190,000 at April 30, 2016. Cash
used in operating activities was approximately $248,000 for the period ended October 31, 2016, as compared with cash used in operating
activities of approximately $204,000 in the comparable period in fiscal 2015.

October 31, 2016, we had stockholders  deficit of approximately $609,000 as compared to a deficit of approximately $1,297,000

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
summary of critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with the discussion of the Company s accounting
policies included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016. We consider the following
accounting policy to be the most critical going forward:  

Basis
of Presentation - The Company s financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2016, have been prepared on a going concern
basis which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of uncertainties.  

Estimates
- The preparation of financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We based our estimates and judgments on historical experience and
on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no
assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we will evaluate our accounting policies
and disclosure practices as necessary.  

ITEM 3.   
       QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.    

Not
applicable.  

ITEM 4.   
       CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES    

a.
Disclosure controls and procedures.  

  As
of the end of period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's Chief
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange
Act ) Rule 13a15(e)) as of October 31, 2016, are not effective, due to lack of segregation of duties, based on the evaluation
of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a15.  

b.
Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.  

  No
changes were made to the Company's internal controls in the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely materially to affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION

following table sets forth the sales of unregistered securities since the Company s last-filed report on Form 8-K covering
sales of unregistered securities or on Form 10-Q filed under this item.

under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Securities Act ), alternatively, as transactions either not involving
