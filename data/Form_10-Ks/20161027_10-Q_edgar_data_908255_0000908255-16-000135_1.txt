BORGWARNER INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

(1)      Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flow activity required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of results have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, including the adoption of Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03,   "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."    The current year adoption of this guidance resulted in the reduction of assets and liabilities by approximately   $16 million   in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.     For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by those financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

(2)   Research and Development Expenditures 
    
  The Company's net Research   Development ("R D") expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.  
    
  The following table presents the Company s gross and net expenditures on R D activities: 

The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R D locations. No such contract exceeded   5%   of annual net R D expenditures in any of the periods presented.

(3)   Other Expense, net 
    
  Items included in other expense, net consist of: 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company acquired   100%   of the equity interests in Remy International, Inc. ("Remy"). During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred transition and realignment expenses and other professional fees associated with this transaction of   $18.9 million   and   $3.9 million  , respectively. Additionally, in October 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the light vehicle aftermarket business associated with Remy.  As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment expense of   $106.5 million   in the third quarter of 2016 to adjust the net book value of this business to fair value. See the Recent Transactions footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded restructuring expense of   $26.9 million   and   $41.3 million  , respectively. This expense relates to Drivetrain and Engine segment actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness, as well as a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility. See the Restructuring footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these expenses. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company completed the purchase of the remaining   51%   of BERU Diesel Start Systems Pvt. Ltd. ("BERU Diesel") by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a   $10.8 million   gain on the previously held equity interest in this joint venture. See the Recent Transactions footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition. 

(4)   Income Taxes 
    
  The Company's provision for income taxes is based upon an estimated annual tax rate for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income.  On a quarterly basis, the annual effective tax rate is adjusted, as appropriate, based upon changed facts and circumstances, if any, as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year and each interim period thereafter. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months was     32.6%  .   This rate includes tax benefits of   $27.6 million    and     $5.9 million     related to asset impairment and restructuring expense, respectively as discussed in the Other Expense, net footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and     $3.7 million     related to other one-time tax adjustments, as well as a tax expense of      $2.2 million     related to a gain associated with the release of certain Remy light vehicle aftermarket liabilities due to the expiration of a customer contract.     
    
  At September 30, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months was   30.0%  . This rate includes tax benefits of   $4.1 million   related to restructuring expense as discussed in the Other Expense, net footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,   $4.1 million   primarily related to foreign  
  
    8 

     Table of Contents     

tax incentives and   $3.9 million   related to tax settlements, partially offset by   $5.8 million   of tax expense related to a global realignment plan.  
    
  The annual effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates which differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits, including foreign tax credits, and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for certain items, including equity in affiliates' earnings.  
    
  Remy applied for a bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") between the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and South Korean National Tax Service covering the tax years 2007 through 2014. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an uncertain tax benefit and related U.S. foreign tax credits of approximately   $44.0 million  . In the second quarter of 2016, the Company received the signed APA from the tax authorities and reclassified the related uncertain tax benefit to a current tax payable, which the Company paid in the third quarter of 2016. 

(5)   Inventories, net 
    
  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of certain U.S. inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, while other U.S. and foreign operations use the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average-cost methods. Inventories consisted of the following: 

(6)   Property, Plant and Equipment, net 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accounts payable of   $50.5 million   and   $76.9 million  , respectively, were related to property, plant and equipment purchases. 
    
  Interest costs capitalized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $10.4 million   and   $12.4 million  , respectively.

Table of Contents     

(7)   Product Warranty 
    
  The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual.  
    
  The following table summarizes the activity in the product warranty accrual accounts: 

Acquisition activity in 2016 of   $6.9 million   relates to the Company's accrual for product issues that pre-dated the Company's 2015 acquisition of Remy.  
    
  Acquisition activity in 2015 of   $17.1 million   relates to the Company's settlement of a significant warranty claim associated with a product issue that pre-dated the Company's 2014 acquisition of Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG ("Wahler"). Including the impact of the reversal of a corresponding receivable, this settlement had an immaterial impact on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2015 and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The Company s warranty provision as a percentage of net sales has increased from   0.2%   as of September 30, 2015 to   0.7%   as of September 30, 2016. This change is primarily related to the Company s fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of Remy. Furthermore, the Company's 2016 provision includes a   $5.2 million   warranty reversal related to the expiration of a Remy light vehicle aftermarket customer contract.  
    
  The product warranty liability is classified in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

(8)   Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had short-term and long-term debt outstanding as follows: 

In July 2016, the Company terminated interest rate swaps which had the effect of converting   $384.0 million   of fixed rate notes to variable rates. The gain on the termination is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining terms of the notes. The value related to these swap terminations as of September 30, 2016 was   $4.1 million   and   $1.4 million   on the 4.625% and 8.00% notes, respectively, as an increase to the notes. The value of these interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2015 was   $1.9 million   and   $0.8 million   on the 4.625% and 8.00% notes, respectively, as a decrease to the notes.  
    
  The Company terminated fixed to floating interest rate swaps in 2009. The gain on the termination is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the notes. The value related to these swap terminations at September 30, 2016 was   $0.2 million   and   $4.5 million   on the 5.75% and 8.00% notes, respectively, as an increase to the notes. The value related to these swap terminations at December 31, 2015 was   $2.4 million   and   $5.5 million   on the 5.75% and 8.00% notes, respectively, as an increase to the notes. 
    
  The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was   1.2%   and   1.3%  , respectively. The weighted average interest rate on all borrowings outstanding, including the effects of outstanding swaps, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was   3.7%   and   3.6%  , respectively. 
    
  The Company has a   $1 billion     multi-currency revolving credit facility which includes a feature that allows the Company's borrowings to be increased to     $1.25 billion  .   The facility provides for borrowings through June 30, 2019. The Company has one key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement which is a debt to EBITDA ("Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization") ratio.     The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at September 30, 2016 and expects to remain compliant in future periods.      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.     
    
  The Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of     $1 billion  .   Under this  
  
    11 

     Table of Contents     

program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.     At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding borrowings of     $270.0 million   and   $215.0 million  , respectively,   under this program, which is classified in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in Notes payable and other short-term debt.      
    
  The total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed   $1 billion  . 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair values of the Company s senior unsecured notes totaled   $2,365.3 million   and   $2,197.6 million  , respectively. The estimated fair values were    $159.7 million   and   $17.7 million   higher than their carrying value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Fair market values of the senior unsecured notes are developed using observable values for similar debt instruments, which are considered Level 2 inputs as defined by ASC Topic 820. The carrying values of the Company's multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program approximates fair value. The fair value estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company could realize in the current markets. 
    
  The Company had outstanding letters of credit of   $37.5 million   and   $29.3 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The letters of credit typically act as guarantees of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. 

(9)   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows: 
    
           Level 1: 
    Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 
              Level 2: 
    Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
              Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
       
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in ASC Topic 820: 
    
           A. 
    Market approach:   Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business. 
              B. 
    Cost approach:   Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). 
              C. 
    Income approach:   Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based upon market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models).

In addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As further described in the Recent Transactions footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the fair value of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket business, based on the anticipated sale price, was less than the carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment expense of   $106.5 million   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to adjust the net book value of this business to its fair value. As the fair value was determined using other observable inputs, the fair value measurement is classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy.  

(10)   Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company s financial instruments include cash and marketable securities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, their book value approximates their fair value. The Company s financial instruments may include long-term debt, interest rate and cross-currency swaps, commodity derivative contracts and foreign currency derivatives. All derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an S P, or equivalent, investment grade credit rating at the time of the contracts  placement.

The Company uses certain commodity derivative contracts to protect against commodity price changes related to forecasted raw material and supplies purchases. The Company primarily utilizes forward and option contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:  

The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). In July 2016, the Company terminated the following interest swaps which were outstanding at December 31, 2015.

The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to protect against exchange rate movements for forecasted cash flows, including capital expenditures, purchases, operating expenses or sales transactions designated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating unit. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposure associated with our net investment in certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). Foreign currency derivative contracts require the Company, at a future date, to either buy or sell foreign currency in exchange for the operating units  local currency.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following foreign currency derivative contracts were outstanding:

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following amounts were recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as being payable to or receivable from counterparties under ASC Topic 815:  

Effectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly, thereafter. To the extent that derivative instruments are deemed to be effective, gains and losses arising from these contracts are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into income as the underlying operating transactions are recognized. These realized gains or losses offset the hedged transaction and are recorded on the same line in the statement of operations. To the extent that derivative instruments are deemed to be ineffective, gains or losses are recognized into income.   
    
  The table below shows deferred gains (losses) reported in AOCI as well as the amount expected to be reclassified to income in one year or less. The amount expected to be reclassified to income in one year or less assumes no change in the current relationship of the hedged item at September 30, 2016 market rates. 

Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC Topic 815 held during the period resulted in the following gains and losses recorded in income:

(12)   Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Under the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan ("2004 Plan"), the Company granted options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. The options vested over periods of up to   three years   and have a term of   10 years   from date of grant. At its November 2007 meeting, the Company's Compensation Committee decided that restricted common stock awards and stock units ("restricted stock") would be awarded in place of stock options for long-term incentive award grants to employees. Restricted stock granted to employees primarily vests   50%   after   two years   and the remainder after   three years   from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors generally vests on the first anniversary date of the grant. In February 2014, the Company's Board of Directors replaced the expired 2004 Plan by adopting the BorgWarner Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ("2014 Plan"). On April 30, 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the 2014 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan,   8 million   shares are authorized for grant, of which approximately   5.7 million   shares are available for future issuance as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Stock options   A summary of the Company s stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Restricted stock   The value of restricted stock is determined by the market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. In 2016, restricted stock in the amount of   698,788   shares and   25,048   shares was granted to employees and non-employee directors, respectively. The value of the awards is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the restriction periods. As of September 30, 2016, there was   $32.5 million   of unrecognized compensation expense that will be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.7 years  .  
    
   The Company recorded restricted stock compensation expense of   $6.8 million   and   $19.9 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $6.9 million   and   $21.1 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

(14)   Contingencies  
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.    
    
  Litigation    
    
  In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America ( UAW ) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of     $4.0 million     as a result of the Court's decision.    
    
  DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor - Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit.  This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.    
    
  Environmental    
    
  The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ( PRPs ) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( Superfund ) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at     27     such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.    
    
  The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.    

20 

     Table of Contents     

Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of     $4.9 million     and     $5.4 million     at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.    
    
  The Company previously resolved certain indemnity claims asserted by Kuhlman Electric Corporation ( Kuhlman Electric ), a former indirect subsidiary of the Company, arising from the Company s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric s parent company. The underlying claims against Kuhlman Electric, now resolved, alleged bodily injury and property damage arising from historical operations of Kuhlman Electric s manufacturing plant in Crystal Springs, Mississippi.  As part of the resolution of Kuhlman Electric s indemnity claims, the Company is now entitled to a share of any insurance proceeds that may be obtained in connection with the underlying claims for which Kuhlman Electric sought indemnity from the Company.  The Company and Kuhlman Electric are jointly pursuing insurance proceeds through coverage litigation against numerous insurers, which currently is pending in Mississippi state and federal courts.    
    
  Product Liability    
    
  Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We believe that the Company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately     9,500     and     10,100     pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively.   The decrease in the pending claims is primarily a result of the Company's continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims.     
    
  The Company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment.  The nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the Company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2016, of the approximately     2,200     claims resolved,     256   (  12%  )   resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2015, of the approximately     5,300     claims resolved,     349   (  7%  )   resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.    
    
  Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the Company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.    
    
  A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies against the Company and certain of its historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers, resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the Company.   The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.    

21 

     Table of Contents     

To date, the Company has paid and accrued     $424.6 million     in defense and indemnity costs in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received     $229.6 million     in cash and notes from insurers. The net balance of     $195.0 million     is expected to be fully recovered.   Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2015, insurers owed     $163.3 million     in association with these claims.    
    
  In addition to the     $195.0 million     net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of     $112.4 million   f  or claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at September 30, 2016. The Company also has a related asset of   $112.4 million   to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers, which is expected to be fully recovered. Receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above, which is expected to occur subsequent to   September 30, 2017  .   At December 31, 2015, the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was     $108.5 million  . 
    
  The amounts recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:    

The Company believes that its ultimate liability (i.e., the total of its indemnity or other claim dispositions plus legal related fees) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in excess of amounts accrued. The Company's ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos-related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co-defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co-defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the Company, and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels. The Company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability for asbestos-related claims may also be affected in the future by the new discovery of facts; changes in litigation; the impact of any possible tort reform; changes in assumptions regarding the number and nature of asbestos-related claims, including the total population claiming exposure; the amounts of any judgments over time; and changes in settlement/defense strategies. 
    
  The Company reviews, on an ongoing basis, its own experience in handling asbestos-related product liability claims, trends affecting asbestos-related product liability claims in the US tort system, and the status of its insurance coverage for asbestos-related product liability claims. This review is performed  for the purposes of assessing the number and value of asbestos-related product liability claims that have been, or may in the future be, asserted against it. The Company is in a continuing process of enhancing the management and analysis of asbestos-related product liability claims. In the last few years, actions taken as part of this process include: the engagement of new National Coordinating Counsel and several new local counsel panels by BorgWarner Morse TEC Inc. (n/k/a BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC) ( Morse TEC ), the entity that is the defendant in the asbestos-related product liability claims litigation; outsourcing administration and claims handling to a third party; implementing various improvements in the processing of asbestos-related product liability claims; and increasing audits and compliance reviews of counsel handling asbestos-related product liability claims against Morse TEC. Morse TEC has further engaged in a sustained effort to obtain the dismissal of thousands of dormant product liability asbestos-related claims, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of its pending claims by     48 percent     over the past few years.  As part  
  
    22 

     Table of Contents     

of this process, the Company hired a third party consultant to further assist in the analysis of potential future asbestos-related product liability claims against Morse TEC.  These internal actions could have an effect on the reporting of  Morse TEC s future asbestos-related assets and liabilities, including whether a reasonable estimate can be made of future asbestos-related product liability claims against Morse TEC.    

(15)   Restructuring  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company initiated actions primarily in the Drivetrain segment designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness. As a continuation of these actions, the Company finalized severance agreements with   three   labor unions at separate facilities in Western Europe for approximately   450   employees. The Company recorded restructuring expense related to these facilities of   $8.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $3.5 million   and   $18.7 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Included in this restructuring expense are employee termination benefits of   $3.0 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $0.4 million   and   $13.6 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company recorded other restructuring expense of   $5.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and     $3.1 million   and   $5.1 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2014, the Company initiated actions to improve the future profitability and competitiveness of Wahler. The Company recorded restructuring expense related to Wahler of   $9.6 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $2.4 million     and     $5.0 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  Included in this restructuring expense are employee termination benefits of   $4.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $2.4 million   and   $4.5 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company acquired   100%   of the equity interests in Remy and initiated actions to improve future profitability and competitiveness. The Company recorded restructuring expense of   $1.3 million   and   $6.1 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Included in this restructuring expense is   $3.1 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to winding down certain operations in North America. Additionally, the Company recorded employee termination benefits of   $0.3 million     and   $2.0 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily related to contractually required severance associated with Remy executive officers and other employee termination benefits in Mexico. Cash payments for these restructuring activities are expected to be complete by the end of 2017. 
    
  The Company recorded restructuring expense of   $3.0 million   and   $15.1 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, related to a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility by creating a legal entity structure that better aligns with the Company's business strategy. 
    
  Estimates of restructuring expense are based on information available at the time such charges are recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in estimating restructuring expenses, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded. Accordingly, the Company may record revisions of previous estimates by adjusting previously established accruals.

     Table of Contents     

The following tables display a rollforward of the severance accruals recorded within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash flow activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

(16)   Earnings Per Share 
    
  The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock ( EPS ) amounts.  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock and common equivalent stock outstanding during the reporting period.  
    
  The dilutive impact of stock-based compensation is calculated using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes that the Company uses the assumed proceeds from the exercise of awards to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the purchase price that the grantee will pay in the future, compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized and any windfall/(shortfall) tax benefits that  
  
    24 

     Table of Contents     

would be credited/(debited) to capital in excess of par value when the award generates a tax deduction. Options are only dilutive when the average market price of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options.  
    
  The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock: 

(17)   Reporting Segments 
    
  The Company's business is comprised of   two   reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.  
    
  The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ( EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of on-going operating income or loss. 
    
  Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following tables show segment information and Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.

  Divgi-Warner Private Limited. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company sold its   60%   ownership interest in Divgi-Warner Private Limited ("Divgi-Warner") to the joint venture partner. This former joint venture was formed in 1995 to develop and manufacture transfer cases and synchronizer rings in India. As a result of the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately   $5.4 million  , net of capital gains tax and cash divested, which is classified as an investing activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Furthermore, the Company wrote off  noncontrolling interest of   $4.8 million   as result of the sale and recognized a negligible gain in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Remy International, Inc. 
    
  On November 10, 2015, the Company acquired   100%   of the equity interests in Remy for   $29.50   per share in cash. The Company also settled approximately   $361 million   of outstanding debt. Remy was a global market leading producer of rotating electrical components that had key technologies and operations in   10   countries. The cash paid, net of cash acquired, was   $1,187.0 million  .

     Table of Contents     

The Remy acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's position in the rapidly developing powertrain electrification trend, with a complementary combination of technologies and global operations. The operating results and assets are reported within the Company's Drivetrain reporting segment as of the date of the acquisition.  
    
  The following table summarizes the aggregated estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on November 10, 2015, the date of acquisition: 

In connection with the acquisition, the Company capitalized   $303.3 million   for customer relationships,   $46.4 million   for developed technology,   $59.0 million   for the Delco Remy, Remy and Maval trade names,   $3.8 million   for in-process R D and   $0.1 million   for leasehold interests. These intangible assets, excluding the indefinite-lived trade names, will be amortized over a period of   5   to   15   years. Various valuation techniques were used to determine the fair value of the intangible assets, with the primary techniques being forms of the income approach, specifically, the relief-from-royalty and excess earnings valuation methods, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Due to the nature of the transaction, goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.  
    
  The Company is in the process of finalizing all purchase accounting adjustments related to the Remy acquisition. The Company has recorded fair value adjustments based on new information obtained during the measurement period primarily related to warranty, inventory, and deferred taxes. These adjustments have resulted in a decrease in goodwill of   $7.2 million   from the Company's initial estimate. In addition, certain other estimated values for the acquisition, including goodwill, intangible assets and deferred taxes are not yet finalized, and the preliminary purchase price allocations are subject to change as the Company completes its analysis of the fair value at the date of acquisition.  
    
  In October 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the light vehicle aftermarket business associated with the Company s November 10, 2015 acquisition of Remy for approximately   $80 million   in cash. The Remy light vehicle aftermarket business sells remanufactured and new starters, alternators and multi-line products to aftermarket customers, mainly retailers in North America, and warehouse distributors in North America, South America and Europe. The sale of this business will allow the Company to focus on the rapidly developing original equipment manufacturer powertrain electrification trend. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 subject to certain customary terms and conditions, antitrust and other regulatory clearances in the United States and abroad.

The Company determined that assets and liabilities subject to the Remy light vehicle aftermarket business sale met the held for sale criteria during the third quarter of 2016.  As such, assets of   $171.8 million  , including allocated goodwill of   $21.3 million  , and liabilities of   $95.3 million   were reclassified as held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016. The fair value of the assets and liabilities, based on the anticipated sale price, was less than the carrying value, therefore, the Company recorded an asset impairment expense of   $106.5 million   to adjust the net book value of this business to its fair value.  
    
  The assets and liabilities of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket business classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

BERU Diesel Start Systems Pvt. Ltd. 
       
  In January 2015, the Company completed the purchase of the remaining   51%   of BERU Diesel by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner. The former joint venture was formed in 1996 to develop and manufacture glow plugs in India. After this transaction, the Company owns   100%   of the entity. The cash paid, net of cash acquired, was   $12.6 million   (  783.1 million   Indian rupees).  
    
  The operating results are reported within the Company's Engine reporting segment.  The Company paid   $12.6 million  , which is recorded as an investing activity in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a   $10.8 million   gain on the previously held equity interest in this joint venture. Additionally, the Company acquired assets of   $16.0 million  , including   $11.2 million   in definite-lived intangible assets, and assumed liabilities of   $4.6 million  . The Company also recorded   $13.9 million   of goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.

(19)   New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
        In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."   It provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how they are classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."    Under this guidance, the areas of simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.    
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842)."    Under this guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases defined under previous GAAP. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.      
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments." Under this guidance, an acquirer is required to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and recorded fair value adjustments related to the Remy acquisition based on new information obtained during the measurement period primarily related to warranty, inventory, and deferred taxes. These adjustments have resulted in a decrease in goodwill of   $7.2 million   from the Company's initial estimate. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."    Under this guidance, inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.    
    
  In May 2014, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification to add Topic 606,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"   outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2017  .   The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa and is an original equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.   
    
  The Company's products fall into two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. The Engine segment's products include turbochargers, timing devices and chains, emissions systems and thermal systems. The Drivetrain segment's products include transmission components and systems, all-wheel drive torque transfer systems and rotating electrical devices.   

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled   $2,214.2 million  , a   17.5%   increase from the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, and the 2015 acquisition of Remy, net sales increased approximately 6.1%. 
    
  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to   78.7%   in the three months ended September  30, 2016 from   78.9%   in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of the 2015 acquisition of Remy, cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 78.1%. Gross profit and gross margin were   $471.1 million   and   21.3%   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $398.2 million   and   21.1%   in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of the 2015 acquisition of Remy, gross profit and gross margin were $437.6 million and 21.9%. The Company's material cost of sales was approximately 55% of net sales in both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Conversion costs were lower for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to supply base cost control initiatives.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased   $61.7 million   to   $209.7 million   from   $148.0 million   as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. SG A as a percentage of net sales was   9.5%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, up from   7.9%   for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of the 2015 acquisition of Remy, SG A and SG A as a percentage of net sales were $181.6 million and 9.1%. Research and development ("R D") expenses, which are included in SG A expenses, increased   $13.4 million   to   $88.6 million   from   $75.2 million   as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, R D expenses were   4.0%   in both three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Excluding the impact of the 2015 acquisition of Remy, R D expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in SG A as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to lower spending in 2015 due to cost control initiatives as well as higher R D and other administrative costs in 2016. Our continued investment in a number of cross-business R D programs, as well as other key programs, is necessary for the Company s short- and long-term growth. 
    
  Other expense, net of   $111.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes an asset impairment expense of   $106.5 million   to adjust the net book value of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket

business to fair value, based on the anticipated sale price, as it met the held for sale criteria during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and   $5.9 million   for transition and realignment expenses primarily related to Remy. Other expense, net also includes   $1.3 million   and   $9.3 million   of restructuring expense associated with both the Drivetrain and Engine segments in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Drivetrain segment charges in 2015 mostly represent a continuation of expenses associated with the finalization of severance agreements with   three   labor unions at separate facilities in Western Europe for approximately   450   employees. The Engine segment charges in 2015 mainly relate to the 2014 restructuring of the Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG and its general partner ("Wahler") acquisition. Both the Drivetrain and Engine restructuring actions are designed to improve the future profitability and competitiveness of each segment. Also included in the restructuring amount above is   $3.0 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility by creating a legal entity structure that better aligns with the Company's business strategy.  
    
  Equity in affiliates  earnings of   $12.4 million   increased   $3.7 million   as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher earnings from the Company's 50% interest in NSK-Warner as a result of improved business conditions in Asia.   
    
  Interest expense and finance charges of   $22.4 million   increased   $7.4 million   as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the Company's November 2015 issuance of senior notes. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months was     32.6%  .   This rate includes tax benefits of   $27.6 million   and     $5.9 million     related to asset impairment and restructuring expense, respectively as discussed in the Other Expense, net footnote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and     $3.7 million     related to other one-time tax adjustments, as well as a tax expense of      $2.2 million     related to a gain associated with the release of certain Remy light vehicle aftermarket liabilities due to the expiration of a customer contract.   Excluding the impact of these non-comparable items, the Company has estimated its annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations to be approximately 31% for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
    
  At September 30, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months was   30.0%  .

The Company s earnings per diluted share were   $1.90   and   $2.14   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share. 

Reporting Segments 
    
  The Company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.  
    
  The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ( EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of on-going operating income or loss. 
    
  Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following tables show segment information and Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  The Engine segment net sales increased   $50.4 million  , or   3.9%   from the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, net sales increased approximately 3.8% from the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher sales of light vehicle turbochargers and engine timing systems, including variable cam timing, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world. The Engine segment Adjusted EBIT margin was   16.1%   and   16.2%   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  The Drivetrain segment net sales increased   $282.2 million  , or   48.3%  , from the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, and the 2015 acquisition of Remy, net sales increased approximately 11.4% from the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher sales of all-wheel drive systems. The Drivetrain segment Adjusted EBIT margin was   10.0%   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 down from   12.0%   in the three months ended September 30, 2015, this decrease is primarily due to the 2015 acquisition of Remy.  
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  The Engine segment net sales increased   $99.9 million  , or   2.4%  , from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won, net sales increased approximately 3.7% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher sales of light vehicle turbochargers and engine timing systems, including variable cam timing, partially offset by weak aftermarket and commercial vehicle markets around the world. The Engine segment Adjusted EBIT margin was   16.3%   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  The Drivetrain segment net sales increased   $818.7 million  , or   44.9%  , from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese Renminbi 
  and Korean Won, and the 2015 acquisition of Remy, net sales increased approximately 7.1% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher sales of all-wheel drive systems. The Drivetrain segment Adjusted EBIT margin was   10.0%   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 down from   11.7%

     Table of Contents     

in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, this decrease is primarily due to the 2015 acquisition of Remy.  

Outlook for 2016 
    
  Our overall outlook for 2016 is cautious. The Company expects weak global production growth, but moderate net new business-related sales growth in 2016 due to the adoption of BorgWarner products around the world, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which would reduce the U.S. dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales. 
    
  The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long-term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  The Company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2016, the Company had   $518.7 million   of cash, of which $505.7 million of cash is held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions.  The vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, however, doing so could result in increased foreign and U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.  A deferred tax liability has been recorded for the portion of these funds anticipated to be repatriated to the United States. The Company uses its U.S. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to, debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions and other corporate expenses. 
    
  The Company has a   $1 billion     multi-currency revolving credit facility which includes a feature that allows the Company's borrowings to be increased to     $1.25 billion  .   The facility provides for borrowings through June 30, 2019. The Company has one key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement which is a debt to EBITDA ("Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization") ratio.     The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at September 30, 2016 and expects to remain compliant in future periods.   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.  
    
  The Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of     $1 billion  .   Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.     At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding borrowings of     $270.0 million   and   $215.0 million  , respectively,   under this program, which is classified in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in Notes payable and other short-term debt.      
    
  The total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed   $1 billion  . 
    
  In addition to the credit facility, the Company's universal shelf registration has an unlimited amount of various debt and equity instruments that could be issued. 
    
  On February 10, 2016, April 27, 2016 and July 26, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of   $0.13   per share of common stock.  These dividends were paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The Company's net debt to net capital ratio was   35.6%   at September 30, 2016 versus   35.2%   at December 31, 2015. 
    
  From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit rating of BBB+ from both Standard   Poor s and Fitch Ratings and Baa1 from Moody's. The current outlook from Standard   Poor s and Fitch Ratings is stable. During the first quarter of 2016, Moody's revised its outlook from stable to negative. None of the Company s debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased   $122.9 million   to   $593.1 million   in the first nine months of 2016 from   $470.2 million   in the first nine months of 2015. The   $122.9 million   increase primarily reflects higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations and improved working capital. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased   $85.6 million   to   $342.4 million   in the first nine months of 2016 from   $428.0 million   in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, the 2016 sale of Divgi-Warner and the 2015 acquisition of BERU Diesel.  
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $310.1 million   in the first nine months of 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was   $239.5 million   in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease is primarily driven by lower debt borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases. 
    
  We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations, our planned operations for the foreseeable future and our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, the return of capital to stockholders, debt reduction and cash conservation. 

CONTINGENCIES 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.    
    
  Litigation    
    
  In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America ( UAW ) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of     $4.0 million     as a result of the Court's decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor - Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit.  This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.    
    
  Environmental    
    
  The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ( PRPs ) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( Superfund ) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at     27     such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.    
    
  The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.    
    
  Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of     $4.9 million     and     $5.4 million     at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.    
    
  The Company previously resolved certain indemnity claims asserted by Kuhlman Electric Corporation ( Kuhlman Electric ), a former indirect subsidiary of the Company, arising from the Company s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric s parent company. The underlying claims against Kuhlman Electric, now resolved, alleged bodily injury and property damage arising from historical operations of Kuhlman Electric s manufacturing plant in Crystal Springs, Mississippi.  As part of the resolution of Kuhlman Electric s indemnity claims, the Company is now entitled to a share of any insurance proceeds that may be obtained in connection with the underlying claims for which Kuhlman Electric sought indemnity from the Company.  The Company and Kuhlman Electric are jointly pursuing insurance proceeds through coverage litigation against numerous insurers, which currently is pending in Mississippi state and federal courts.

Product Liability    
    
  Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We believe that the Company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately     9,500     and     10,100     pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively.   The decrease in the pending claims is primarily a result of the Company's continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims.  
    
  The Company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment.  The nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the Company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2016, of the approximately     2,200     claims resolved,     256   (  12%  )   resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2015, of the approximately     5,300     claims resolved,     349   (  7%  )   resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.    
    
  Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the Company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.    
    
  A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies against the Company and certain of its historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers, resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the Company.   The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers. 
    
  To date, the Company has paid and accrued     $424.6 million     in defense and indemnity costs in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received     $229.6 million     in cash and notes from insurers. The net balance of     $195.0 million     is expected to be fully recovered.   Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2015, insurers owed     $163.3 million     in association with these claims.    
    
  In addition to the     $195.0 million     net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of     $112.4 million   f  or claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at September 30, 2016. The Company also has a related asset of   $112.4 million   to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers, which is expected to be fully recovered. Receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above, which is expected to occur subsequent to   September 30, 2017  .   At December 31, 2015, the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was     $108.5 million  .

The amounts recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:    

The Company believes that its ultimate liability (i.e., the total of its indemnity or other claim dispositions plus legal related fees) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in excess of amounts accrued. The Company's ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos-related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co-defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co-defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the Company, and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels. The Company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability for asbestos-related claims may also be affected in the future by the new discovery of facts; changes in litigation; the impact of any possible tort reform; changes in assumptions regarding the number and nature of asbestos-related claims, including the total population claiming exposure; the amounts of any judgments over time; and changes in settlement/defense strategies. 
    
  The Company reviews, on an ongoing basis, its own experience in handling asbestos-related product liability claims, trends affecting asbestos-related product liability claims in the US tort system, and the status of its insurance coverage for asbestos-related product liability claims. This review is performed  for the purposes of assessing the number and value of asbestos-related product liability claims that have been, or may in the future be, asserted against it. The Company is in a continuing process of enhancing the management and analysis of asbestos-related product liability claims. In the last few years, actions taken as part of this process include: the engagement of new National Coordinating Counsel and several new local counsel panels by BorgWarner Morse TEC Inc. (n/k/a BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC) ( Morse TEC ), the entity that is the defendant in the asbestos-related product liability claims litigation; outsourcing administration and claims handling to a third party; implementing various improvements in the processing of asbestos-related product liability claims; and increasing audits and compliance reviews of counsel handling asbestos-related product liability claims against Morse TEC. Morse TEC has further engaged in a sustained effort to obtain the dismissal of thousands of dormant product liability asbestos-related claims, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of its pending claims by     48 percent     over the past few years.  As part of this process, the Company hired a third party consultant to further assist in the analysis of potential future asbestos-related product liability claims against Morse TEC.  These internal actions could have an effect on the reporting of  Morse TEC s future asbestos-related assets and liabilities, including whether a reasonable estimate can be made of future asbestos-related product liability claims against Morse TEC.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."   It provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how they are classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,      "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."    Under this guidance, the areas of simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.    
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842)."    Under this guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases defined under previous GAAP. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.      
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments." Under this guidance, an acquirer is required to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and recorded fair value adjustments related to the Remy acquisition based on new information obtained during the measurement period primarily related to warranty, inventory, and deferred taxes. These adjustments have resulted in a decrease in goodwill of   $7.2 million   from the Company's initial estimate. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."    Under this guidance, inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.    
    
  In May 2014, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification to add Topic 606,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"   outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2017  .   The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.    

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Statements contained in this Form 10-Q (including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) may contain forward-looking statements as contemplated by the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (the  Act ) that are based on management's current outlook, expectations, estimates and projections. Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "continues," "could," "designed," "effect," "estimates," "evaluates," "expects," "forecasts," "goal," "initiative," "intends,"  "outlook," "plans," "potential," "project," "pursue," "seek," "should," "target," "when," "would," and variations of such  
  
    41 

     Table of Contents     

words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  All statements, other than statements of historical fact contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future regarding our financial position, business strategy and measures to implement that strategy, including changes to operations, competitive strengths, goals, expansion and growth of our business and operations, plans, references to future success and other such matters, are forward-looking statements.  Accounting estimates, such as those described under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies" in Item 7 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, are inherently forward-looking.  These statements are based on assumptions and analysis made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and the Company's actual results may differ materially from those expressed, projected or implied in or by the forward-looking statements. 
    
  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.  Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control.  Such risks and uncertainties include: the failure to receive the anticipated benefits from BorgWarner s acquisition of Remy, the possibility that the parties may be unable to successfully integrate Remy s operations with those of BorgWarner, that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, or suppliers) may be greater than expected following the transaction; the retention of key employees at Remy may not be achieved; fluctuations in domestic or foreign vehicle production; the continued use by original equipment manufacturers of outside suppliers, fluctuations in demand for vehicles containing our products; changes in general economic conditions; and the other risks noted under Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We do not undertake any obligation to update or announce publicly any updates to or revision to any of the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, circumstances, or assumptions underlying the statements. 
    
  This section is intended to provide meaningful cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Act. This should not be construed as a complete list of all of the economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that could adversely affect our expected consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition and prospects. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  There have been no material changes to the information concerning our exposures to interest rate risk or commodity price risk as stated in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Chinese Renminbi, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, the Mexican Peso, the Swedish Krona and the South Korean Won.  We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. The recent depreciation of the British Pound post the United Kingdom's 2016 vote to leave the European Union  
  
    42 

     Table of Contents     

is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company since net sales from the United Kingdom represents less than 2% of the Company's net sales in 2015. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  
    
  The foreign currency translation adjustment gains of   $27.9 million   and   $41.8 million   for the three and nine  months ended September 30, 2016, and losses of   $37.0 million   and   $202.6 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, contained within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our non-U.S. dollar subsidiaries' financial statements to the Company s reporting currency (U.S. Dollar). The foreign currency translation adjustment gain of   $27.9 million   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the impact of a weakening U.S. dollar against the Euro, Korean Won and Japanese Yen. The first nine months of 2016 foreign currency translation adjustment gain of   $41.8 million   was primarily due to the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar against the Euro, Korean Won and Japanese Yen, partially offset by a strengthening U.S. dollar against British Pound and Chinese Renminbi.  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these procedures are effective. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the Company s business or relating to matters for which the Company may have a contractual indemnity obligation. See Note 14   Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, product liability and other litigation, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
       
  The Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock over three years and authorized the purchase of up to 69.6 million shares  in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased 66,333,438 shares in the aggregate under the Common Stock Repurchase Program. All shares purchased under this authorization have been and will continue to be repurchased in the open market at prevailing prices and at times and in amounts to be determined by management as market conditions and the Company's capital position warrant. The Company may use Rule 10b5-1 and 10b-18 plans to facilitate share repurchases. Repurchased shares will be deemed common stock held in treasury and may subsequently be reissued for general corporate purposes.  
    
  Employee transactions include restricted shares withheld to offset statutory minimum tax withholding that occurs upon vesting of restricted shares. The BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the BorgWarner Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan provide that the withholding obligations

beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any stockholder or beneficial owner that constitute such person s  net long position  as defined in Rule 14e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the  Exchange Act ), provided that (x) for purposes of such definition, in determining such requesting party s  short position,  the reference in Rule 14e-4 to  the date that a tender offer is first publicly announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to holders of the security to be acquired  shall be the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to deliver a written request for a special meeting, and the reference to the  highest tender offer price or stated amount of the consideration offered for the subject security  shall refer to the closing sales price of the Corporation s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other securities exchange designated by the Board of Directors if the Corporation s common stock is not listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange) on such record date (or, if such date is not a trading day, the next succeeding trading day) and (y) the net long position of such requesting party shall be reduced by the number of shares as to which the Board of Directors determines that such requesting party does not, or will not, have the right to vote or direct the vote at the special meeting or as to which the Board of Directors determines that such requesting party has entered into any derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares. In addition, to the extent any affiliates of the stockholder or beneficial owner are acting in concert with the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to the calling of the special meeting, the determination of Net Long Shares may include the effect of aggregating the Net Long Shares (including any negative number) of such affiliate or affiliates. Whether shares constitute Net Long Shares shall ultimately be decided by the Board of Directors in its reasonable determination. 
           (3) In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate at least the Requisite Percentage, multiple Special Meeting Requests delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation will be considered together only if (i) each Special Meeting Request identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the special meeting, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors (which, if such purpose is the nominating of a person or persons for election to the Board of Directors, will mean that the exact same person or persons are nominated in each relevant Special Meeting Request), and (ii) such Special Meeting Requests have been dated and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation within 60 days of the earliest dated Special Meeting Request. For purposes of this Section 3(B), the date of delivery of the Special Meeting  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

Request shall be the first date on which valid Special Meeting Requests constituting not less than the Requisite Percentage have been received by the Secretary. A stockholder may revoke a Special Meeting Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. If, following such revocation, there are unrevoked requests from stockholders representing in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percentage, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting. 
           (4) A Special Meeting Request shall only be valid if it is signed and dated by each stockholder of record submitting the Special Meeting Request and by each of the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made (each such record owner and beneficial owner, a  Requesting Stockholder ). Each Special Meeting Request must be delivered, by hand or by registered U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or courier service, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation s principal executive offices and shall be accompanied by a written notice setting forth the information required by Section 7(A)(2) as to the business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting and as to the stockholder(s) proposing such business, and/or as to any nominations proposed to be presented at the special meeting and as to the stockholder(s) proposing such nominations. In addition to the foregoing, a Special Meeting Request must include; (x) documentary evidence of the number of Net Long Shares owned by each Requesting Stockholder as of the date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation and documentary evidence that such shares have been held continuously for one year, provided that, if any stockholder submitting the Special Meeting Request is not the beneficial owner of such shares, then to be valid, the Special Meeting Request must also include documentary evidence (or, if not simultaneously provided with the Special Meeting Request, such documentary evidence must be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation within 10 days after the date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation) of the number of Net Long Shares owned by the beneficial owner(s) as of the date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation and documentary evidence that such shares have been held continuously for one year; (y) an acknowledgment of each Requesting Stockholder that any decrease in the number of Net Long Shares held by such stockholder after the date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation shall be deemed a revocation of the Special Meeting Request with respect to such shares and that such shares will no longer be included in determining whether the Requisite Percentage has been satisfied; and (z) a commitment by each Requesting Stockholder to continue to satisfy the Requisite Percentage through the date of the Stockholder Requested Special  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

Meeting and to promptly notify the Corporation upon any decrease occurring between the date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation and the date of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting in the number of Net Long Shares owned by such stockholder. 
           (5) Each Requesting Stockholder is required to update and supplement the Special Meeting Request delivered pursuant to this Section 3(B), if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice by Section 7(A)(2) as to the business proposed to be conducted at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting and as to the stockholder(s) proposing such business and/or as to any nominations proposed to be presented at such special meeting and as to the stockholder(s) proposing such nominations shall be true and correct as of the record date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. Such update and supplement shall be received by the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than 5 business days after the record date for the proposed Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. Each Requesting Stockholder also shall certify in writing on the day prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting as to whether such Requesting Stockholder continues to satisfy the Requisite Percentage. In addition to the foregoing, each Requesting Stockholder shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation. 
           (6) At any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the business transacted shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the Special Meeting Request; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the authority in its discretion to submit additional matters to the stockholders and to cause other business to be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3(B), a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall not be held if (i) the Special Meeting Request does not comply with these By-laws, (ii) the business specified in the Special Meeting Request is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, (iii) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held within 90 days after the Secretary of the Corporation receives the Special Meeting Request and the Board of Directors determines that the business of such meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual or special meeting) the business specified in the Special Meeting Request, (iv) the Special Meeting Request is received by the Secretary of the Corporation during the period commencing 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the prior year s annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the date of the final adjournment of the next annual meeting of stockholders, (v) an identical or substantially similar item (a  Similar Item ) was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within 90 days prior to receipt by the Secretary of the Corporation of the Special Meeting Request (and, for purposes of this clause (v), the nomination, election or removal  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

of directors shall be deemed a  Similar Item  with respect to all items of business involving the nomination, election or removal of directors, the changing the size of the Board of Directors and the filling of vacancies and/or newly created directorships), or (vi) the Special Meeting Request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. 
           (7) Except to the extent previously determined by the Board of Directors in connection with a Special Meeting Request or as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-laws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these By-laws, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3(B), unless otherwise required by law, if the Requesting Stockholder(s) does not appear at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting to present a nomination or other proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. 
  SECTION 4.        VOTING.  Each stockholder shall be entitled to vote in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation and in accordance with the provisions of these By-Laws, in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. 
  A complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the ensuing election, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of each, and the number of shares held by each, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. 
  SECTION 5.        QUORUM.  Except as otherwise required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, the presence, in person or  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders.  In case a quorum shall not be present at any meeting, a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote shall be present. 
  When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith.  At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

No business other than that stated in the notice shall be transacted at any meeting without the unanimous consent of all the stockholders entitled to vote thereat.  Any previously scheduled annual meeting of the stockholders may be postponed, and any previously scheduled special meeting of the stockholders may be postponed or cancelled by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.

  (A)  The Board of Directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meetings of stockholders and make a written report thereof.  One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.

Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.  The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 

Exhibit 3.1/4.1

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 12 shall limit the Corporation s ability to solicit against any Stockholder Nominee or include in its proxy materials the Corporation s own statements or other information relating to any Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 12.  Subject to the provisions of this Section 12, the name of any Stockholder Nominee included in the Corporation s proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders shall also be set forth on the form of proxy distributed by the Corporation in connection with such annual meeting.

In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting, or the public announcement of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Notice of Proxy Access Nomination pursuant to this Section 12.  In addition to other requirements set forth in this Section 12, the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must include the name and address of the Eligible Stockholder (including each Stockholder and/or beneficial owner whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder). 
  C)    The maximum number of Stockholder Nominees nominated by all Eligible Stockholders that will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of the number of directors in office as of the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date or, if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below 20% (such number, as it may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 12(C), the  Permitted Number ).  In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date but before the date of the annual meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.  In addition, the Permitted Number shall be reduced by (i) the number of individuals who will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials as nominees recommended by the Board of Directors pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of stock from the Corporation by such stockholder or group of stockholders) and (ii) the number of directors in office as of the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date who were included in the Corporation s proxy materials as Stockholder Nominees for any of the two preceding annual meetings of stockholders (including any persons counted as Stockholder Nominees pursuant to the immediately  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

succeeding sentence) and whom the Board of Directors decides to nominate for re-election to the Board of Directors.  For purposes of determining when the Permitted Number has been reached, any individual nominated by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 12 whose nomination is subsequently withdrawn or whom the Board of Directors decides to nominate for election to the Board of Directors shall be counted as one of the Stockholder Nominees.  Any Eligible Stockholder submitting more than one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 12 shall rank such Stockholder Nominees based on the order in which the Eligible Stockholder desires such Stockholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials in the event that the total number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this Section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number.  In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this Section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number, the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 12 from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of stock of the Corporation each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Notice of Proxy Access Nomination.  If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 12 from each Eligible Stockholder has been selected, then the next highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 12 from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials, and this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 12, the Corporation shall not be required to include any Stockholder Nominees in its proxy materials pursuant to this Section 12 for or any meeting of stockholders for which the Secretary of the Corporation receives notice that a stockholder intends to nominate one or more persons for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees set forth in Section 7 of these By-Laws. 
  D)    An  Eligible Stockholder  is a stockholder or group of no more than twenty-five (25) stockholders (counting as one stockholder, for this purpose, any two or more funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund Group (as defined below)) that (i) has owned (as defined in Section 12(E)) continuously for at least three years (the  Minimum Holding Period ) a number of shares of stock of the Corporation that represents at least three (3) percent of the voting power of all shares of stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

entitled to vote in the election of directors as of the date the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation in accordance with this Section 12 (the  Required Shares ), (ii) continues to own the Required Shares through the date of the annual meeting and (iii) satisfies all other requirements of, and complies with all applicable procedures set forth in, this Section 12.   A  Qualifying Fund Group  means two or more funds that are (A) under common management and investment control, (B) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer or (C) a  group of investment companies  as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  Whenever the Eligible Stockholder consists of a group of stockholders (including a group of funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund Group), (x) each provision in this Section 12 that requires the Eligible Stockholder to provide any written statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments or to meet any other conditions shall be deemed to require each stockholder (including each individual fund) that is a member of such group to provide such statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments and to meet such other conditions (except that the members of such group may aggregate the shares that each member has owned continuously for the Minimum Holding Period in order to meet the three percent ownership requirement of the  Required Shares  definition) and (y) a breach of any obligation, agreement or representation under this Section 12 by any member of such group shall be deemed a breach by the Eligible Stockholder.  No person may be a member of more than one group of stockholders constituting an Eligible Stockholder with respect to any annual meeting. 
  E)    For purposes of calculating the Required Shares,  ownership  shall be deemed to consist of and include only the outstanding shares as to which a person possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the Shares and (ii) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such Shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) shall not include any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such stockholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares of outstanding stock of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (1) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

the future, such stockholder s or its affiliates  full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and/or (2) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree any gain or loss realized or realizable from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or affiliate.  A stockholder shall  own  shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares.  A stockholder s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (i) the stockholder has loaned such shares, provided that the stockholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days  notice and includes in the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination an agreement that it (A) will promptly recall such loaned shares upon being notified that any of its Stockholder Nominees will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials and (B) will continue to hold such recalled shares through the date of the annual meeting or (ii) the stockholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is revocable at any time by the stockholder.  The terms  owned,   owning  and other variations of the word  own  shall have correlative meanings.  Whether outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation are  owned  for these purposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors.  For purposes of this Section 12, the term  affiliate  or  affiliates  shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act. 
  F)    To be in proper written form, the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must include or be accompanied by the following: 
  i.  a written statement by the Eligible Stockholder certifying as to the number of shares it owns and has owned continuously for the Minimum Holding Period, and the Eligible Stockholder s agreement to provide (A) within five business days following the later of the record date for the annual meeting or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed, a written statement by the Eligible Stockholder certifying as to the number of shares it owns and has owned continuously through the record date and (B) immediate notice if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to own any of the Required Shares prior to the date of the annual meeting;

Corporation that demonstrates that the funds are part of the same Qualifying Fund Group. 
  G)    At the request of the Corporation, each Stockholder Nominee must: (i) provide an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the Board of Directors or its designee, that (A) the Stockholder Nominee has read and agrees, if elected, to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, to adhere to the Corporation s Guidelines on Corporate Governance Issues and Code of Conduct and any other Corporation policies and guidelines applicable to directors, and (B) that the Stockholder Nominee is not and will not become a party to any compensatory, payment or other financial agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity in connection with his or her nomination, service or action as a director of the Corporation, or any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity as to how the Stockholder Nominee would vote or act on any issue or question as a director, in each case that has not been disclosed to the Corporation; (ii) submit all completed and signed questionnaires required of the Corporation s Board of Directors and the representation and agreement required by Article II, Section 8 of these By-Laws within five (5) business days of receipt of each such questionnaire from the Corporation; and (iii) provide within five (5) business days of the Corporation s request such additional information as the Corporation determines may be necessary to permit the Board of Directors to determine (A) if such Stockholder Nominee is independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the Corporation s directors, (B) if such Stockholder Nominee has any direct or indirect relationship with the Corporation, and (C) if such Stockholder Nominee is not and has not been subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Stockholder or the Stockholder Nominee to the Corporation or its Stockholders ceases to be true and correct in any respect or omits a fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary of any such inaccuracy or omission in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to make such information or communication true and correct.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 12, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
  I)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 12, the Corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any meeting of Stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation: (i) if the Stockholder Nominee or the Eligible Stockholder (or any member of any group of Stockholders that together is such Eligible Stockholder) who has nominated such Stockholder Nominee has engaged in or is currently engaged in, or has been or is a  participant  in another person s,  solicitation  within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the applicable annual meeting of Stockholders other than its Stockholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors; (ii) if another person is engaging in a  solicitation  within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the applicable annual meeting of Stockholders other than a nominee of the Board of Directors; (iii) who is not independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing independence of the Corporation s directors, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors; (iv) who does not meet the audit committee independence requirements under the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporation s securities are traded, is not a  non-employee director  for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule),  or is not an  outside director  for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (or any successor provision), (v) whose election as a member of the Board of Directors would cause the Corporation to be in violation of these Bylaws, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended), the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. securities exchanges upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, or any applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation; (vi) who is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914; (vii) whose then-current or within the preceding ten (10) years  business or personal interests place such Stockholder Nominee in a conflict of interest with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries that would cause such  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

Stockholder Nominee to violate any fiduciary duties of directors established pursuant to DGCL, including but not limited to, the duty of loyalty and duty of care, as determined by the Board of Directors; (ix) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years; (x) if such Stockholder Nominee or the applicable Eligible Stockholder (or any member of any group of Stockholders that together is such Eligible Stockholder) shall have provided information to the Corporation in connection with such nomination that was untrue in any material respect or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make any statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, as determined by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof; (xi) the Eligible Stockholder (or any member of any group of Stockholders that together is such Eligible Stockholder) does not appear at the applicable annual meeting of Stockholders to present the Stockholder Nominee for election; (xii) the Eligible Stockholder (or any member of any group of Stockholders that together is such Eligible Stockholder) or applicable Stockholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply with its representations or obligations pursuant to these Bylaws, including, without limitation, this Section 12; or (xiii) the Eligible Stockholder ceases to be an Eligible Stockholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting. For the purpose of this paragraph, clauses (iii) through (xiii) will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 12 of the specific Stockholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of the Stockholder Nominee; however, clauses (i) and (ii) will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 12 of all Stockholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of Stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of all Stockholder Nominees. 
  J)    This Section 12 provides the exclusive method for a stockholder to include nominees for election to the Board of Directors in the Corporation s proxy materials.

Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.   
  SECTION 2.        NUMBER, TENURE AND QUALIFICATIONS.

  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

If by facsimile transmission or similar means of electronic communication, such notice shall be transmitted at least 24 hours before such meeting.  If by telephone, the notice shall be given at least 12 hours prior to the time set for the meeting.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice of such meeting, except for amendments to these By-Laws as provided under Article VII hereof.

The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws require the vote of a greater number. 
  SECTION 7.        VACANCIES.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, or any other series or class of stock as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, to elect directors under specified circumstances, and unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, vacancies resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of a  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and any director so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such director s successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.  No decrease in the number of authorized directors constituting the Whole Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.  
  SECTION 8.        REMOVAL.

For purposes of these By-Laws,  Voting Stock  shall mean the shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.  
  SECTION 9.        RESIGNATIONS.  Any director, member of a committee or other officer may resign at any time.

  SECTION 10.        COMMITTEES.  The Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the Whole Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation.  The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.  In the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. 
  Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, or in these By-Laws, shall have and may exercise all the  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of Directors as provided in subsection (a) of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, fix the designation and any of the preferences and any of the rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of any shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation s property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the By-Laws of the Corporation; and, unless the resolution, these By-Laws or the Certificate of Incorporation expressly so provides, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock.

Adequate provision shall be made for notice to members of all meetings; one third of the members shall constitute a quorum unless the committee shall consist of one or two members, in which event one member shall constitute a quorum; and all matters shall be determined by a majority vote of the members present.  Action may be taken by any committee without a meeting if all members thereof consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of such committee.   
  If as a result of a catastrophe or other emergency condition a quorum of any committee of the Board of Directors having power to act in the premises cannot readily be convened and a quorum of the Board of Directors cannot readily be convened, then all the powers and duties of the Board of Directors shall automatically vest and continue, until a quorum of the Board of Directors can be convened, in an Emergency Management Committee, which shall consist of all readily available members of the Board of Directors and two of whose members shall constitute a quorum.  The Emergency Management Committee shall call a meeting of the Board of Directors as soon as  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

circumstances permit for the purpose of filling any vacancies on the Board of Directors and its committees and taking such other action as may be appropriate. 
  SECTION 11.        COMPENSATION.  Directors shall not receive any stated salary for their services as directors or as members of committees, but by resolution of the board an annual retainer and a fixed fee and expenses of attendance may be allowed for attendance at each meeting.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.   
  SECTION 12.        ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.  Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting, if prior to such action a written consent thereto is signed by all members of the board or of such committee, as the case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.

  ARTICLE V            INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE 
  SECTION 1.        Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a  proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was, at any time during which these By-Laws are in effect (whether or not such person continues to serve in such capacity at the time any indemnification or payment of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the time any proceeding relating thereto exists or is brought), a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys  fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VI, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI shall be a contract right that vests at the time of such person s service to or at the request of the Corporation and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.  The right to indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Corporation within 20 days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise. 
  SECTION 2.        To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification.  Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant s entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (1) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (iii) if a quorum of  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the Corporation.  In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a  Change of Control  as defined in the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (as such plan shall exist as of the date of adoption of these Amended and Restated By-Laws), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors.  If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination. 
  SECTION 3.        If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a written claim pursuant to Section 2 of this Article VI has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

SECTION 4.        If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 2 of this Article VI that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 3 of this Article VI. 
  SECTION 5.        The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 3 of this Article VI that the procedures and presumptions of this Article VI are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article VI. 
  SECTION 6.        The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.  No repeal or modification of this Article VI shall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification and cannot be terminated by the Corporation, the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation with respect to a person s service prior to the date of such termination.  Any amendment, modification, alteration or repeal of this By-Law that in any way diminishes, limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee or his or her successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict, adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission. 
  SECTION 7.        The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

Delaware.  To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such current or former director or officer, and each such agent or employee to which rights to indemnification have been granted as provided in Section 8 of this Article VI, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage there under for any such director, officer, employee or agent. 
  SECTION 8.        The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any current or former employee or agent or class of employees or agents of the Corporation (including the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of each such person) to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of current or former directors and officers of the Corporation. 
  SECTION 9.        If any provision or provisions of this Article VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 
  SECTION 10.        For purposes of this Article VI: 
  (a)         Disinterested Director  means a director of the Corporation who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant.   
  (b)         Independent Counsel  means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of  

Exhibit 3.1/4.1 

interest in representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to determine the claimant s rights under this Article VI. 
  SECTION 11.        Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the Corporation under this Article VI shall be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram, overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Corporation and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Secretary. 
  ARTICLE VI            AMENDMENTS 
  These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, and any By-Laws may be made, at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any special meeting thereof if notice of the proposed alteration or repeal of the By-Laws, or of the By-Laws to be made, is contained in the notice of such meeting, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors, at any regular meeting of the Board of Directors, or at any special meeting of the Board of Directors, if notice of the proposed alteration or repeal, or of the By-Laws to be made, is contained in the notice of such special meeting.

  When used in these By-Laws, the terms  written  and  in writing  shall include any  electronic transmission  (as defined in Section 232(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended), including, without limitation, any telegram, cablegram, datagram, facsimile transmission and communication by electronic mail.

Second Amendment To         BorgWarner Inc.   Amended and Restated         2004 Stock Incentive Plan 
  Effective as of the date adopted by the BorgWarner Inc. Board of Directors, the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan is hereby amended as follows: 
  1. Section 1 0(b)(v) is amended to read as follows: 
  (v) At the expiration of the Performance Period, the Committee shall evaluate the extent to which the Performance Goals for the Award have been achieved and shall determine the number of Performance Units granted to the participant which shall have been earned, and the cash value thereof. The Committee shall then cause to be delivered to the participant (A) a cash payment equal in amount to the cash value of the Performance Units, or (B) shares of Stock equal in value to the cash value of the Performance Units, the form of payment determined by the Committee in its discretion or as provided in the applicable Award Agreement. Payment shall occur as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Performance Period ends. 
  In the Committee's discretion, the Committee may evaluate and certify the extent to which the Performance Goals for the Award have been achieved as of any date of the Performance Period. Based on this interim evaluation and certification, the Committee shall determine the number of Performance Units granted to the participant which shall have been earned based on achievement of the Performance Goals as of the interim evaluation date, and the cash value thereof. The Committee shall then cause to be delivered to the participant (A) a cash payment equal in amount to the cash value of the Performance Units earned based on the interim evaluation, pro-rated for the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the interim valuation and further reduced to reasonably reflect the time value of money as required by Code Section 162(m), or (B) shares of Stock equal in value to the cash value of the Performance Units earned based on the interim valuation, pro-rated for the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the interim valuation, and further reduced to reasonably reflect the time value of money as required by Code Section 162(m), the form of payment determined by the Committee in its discretion or as provided in the Applicable Award Agreement. Payment shall occur as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Committee certifies the interim Performance Goals. Payment of Performance Units based on an interim valuation is conditioned on the participant's repayment to the Company of any amount by which the cash value of the Performance Units determined to 

Exhibit 10.1 

have been earned as of the interim valuation (before reduction to reflect the time value of money) exceeds the cash value of the Performance Units determined to have been earned as of the end of the Performance Period. 
    
  At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall evaluate the extent to which the Performance Goals for the Award have been achieved for the entire Performance Period and determine the number of Performance Units granted to the Participant which shall have been earned for the entire Performance Period, and the cash value thereof. The cash value of the Performance Units determined to have been earned as of the interim valuation, after pro-ration but before reduction to reflect the time value of money, will be deducted from the cash value of the Performance Units determined to have been earned for the entire Performance Period. Any cash value of the earned Performance Units as of the end of the Performance Period in excess of the cash value of the earned Performance Units as of the interim valuation will be paid as provided in the first paragraph of this Section 10(b)(v). Any cash value of the earned Performance Units as of the interim valuation in excess of the cash value of the earned Performance Units as of the end of the Performance Period must be repaid by the participant.  If Performance Units may, or are to be paid in Stock, the Committee shall designate in the applicable Award Agreement a method of converting the Performance Units into Stock based on the Fair Market Value of the Stock. 
  2. Section 11(b)(v) is amended to read as follows: 
  (v) At the expiration of the Performance Period, the Committee shall evaluate the extent to which the Performance Goals for the Award have been achieved and shall determine the number of Performance Shares granted to the participant which shall have been earned, and the cash value thereof. The Committee shall then cause to be delivered to the participant (A) a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Performance Shares determined by the Committee to have been earned, or (B) cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such number of shares of Stock, the form of payment determined by the Committee in its discretion or as provided in the applicable Award Agreement. Payment shall occur as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Performance Period ends. 
  In the Committee's discretion, the Committee may evaluate and certify the extent to which the Performance Goals for the Award have been achieved as of any date in the final six months of the Performance Period. Based on this interim evaluation and certification, the Committee shall determine the number of Performance Shares granted to the participant which shall have 

Exhibit 10.1 

been earned based on achievement of the Performance Goals as of the interim evaluation date, and the cash value thereof. The Committee shall then cause to be delivered to the participant (A) a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Performance Shares determined by the Committee to have been earned based on the interim evaluation, pro-rated for the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the interim valuation and further reduced to reasonably reflect the time value of money as required by Code Section 162(m), or (B) cash equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Stock earned based on the interim valuation, prorated for the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the interim valuation, and further reduced to reasonably reflect the time value of money as required by Code Section 162(m), the form of payment determined by the Committee in its discretion or as provided in the Applicable Award Agreement. Payment shall occur as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Committee certifies achievement of the interim Performance Goals. Payment of Performance Shares based on an interim valuation is conditioned on the participant's repayment to the Company of any amount by which the cash value of the Performance Shares determined to have been earned as of the interim valuation (before reduction to reflect the time value of money) exceeds the cash value of the Performance Shares determined to have been earned as of the end of the Performance Period. 
  At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall evaluate the extent to which the Performance Goals for the Award have been achieved for the entire Performance Period and determine the number of Performance Shares granted to the Participant which shall have been earned for the entire Performance Period, and the cash value thereof. The cash value of the Performance Shares determined to have been earned as of the interim valuation, after proration but before reduction to reflect the time value of money, will be deducted from the cash value of the Performance Shares determined to have been earned for the entire Performance Period. Any cash value of the earned Performance Shares as of the end of the Performance Period in excess of the cash value of the earned Performance Shares as of the interim valuation will be paid as provided in the first paragraph of this Section 11(b)(v). Any cash value of the earned Performance Shares as of the interim valuation in excess of the cash value of the earned Performance Shares as of the end of the Performance Period must be repaid by the participant.

Amendment To         The BorgWarner Inc.         2005 Executive Incentive Plan         (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2009) 
  Effective as of the date this amendment is adopted by the Compensation Committee of the BorgWarner Inc. Board of Directors, the BorgWarner Inc. 2005 Executive Incentive Plan (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2009) is hereby amended as follows: 
  1. Section 5.5(b) is amended to read as follows: 
  (b) As soon as possible after the determination of the Award Pool for a Plan Year, the Committee shall calculate each Participant's allocated portion of the incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of the Plan Year. Each Participant's incentive award then shall be determined by the Committee based on the Participant's allocated portion of the incentive pool subject to Section 5.3 and any downward adjustment, such downward adjustment to be in the sole discretion of the Committee. In no event may the portion of the incentive pool allocated to a Participant be increased in any way, including as a result of the reduction of any other Participant's allocated portion. The Committee shall retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downward. 
  In the Committee's discretion, the Committee may determine and certify the Award Pool based on Operating Income calculated as if any date in the six months before the end of the Plan Year was the last day of the Plan Year. Based on this interim determination and certification of the Award Pool, the Committee shall calculate a Participant's allocated portion of the interim incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of the Plan Year. The Participant's interim incentive award then shall be determined by the Committee based on the Participant's allocated portion of the incentive pool subject to Section 5.3, prorated for the portion of the Plan Year completed as of the interim determination date and further reduced to reasonably reflect the time value of money as required by Code Section 162(m) and any downward adjustment, with the downward adjustment to be in the sole discretion of the Committee. In no event may the portion of the interim incentive pool allocated to a Participant be increased in any way, including as a result of the reduction of any other Participant's allocated portion. The Committee shall then cause to be paid to the Participant in cash the Participant's interim incentive award as determined under this second paragraph of Section 5.5(b) as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee's determination, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Committee determines the interim Award Pool. Payment of an interim Award is conditioned on the Participant's repayment 

Exhibit 10.2 

to the Company of any amount by which the Participant's interim Award (after pro-ration and discretionary downward adjustment but before reduction to reflect the time value of money) exceeds the Participant's Award determined to have been earned as of the end of the Plan Year. 
  At the end of the Plan Year, the Committee shall determine the Participant's Award as provided under the first paragraph of this Section 5.5(b). The Participant's interim Award paid as of the interim determination, after pro-ration and discretionary downward adjustment but before reduction to reflect the time value of money, will be deducted from the Participant's Award determined for the entire Plan Year. If the Participant's Award for the entire Plan Year exceeds the Participant's interim Award, the excess will be paid as provided in Section 5.5(c). If the Participant's Award for the entire Plan Year is less than the Participant's interim Award, the Participant is required to repay the excess to the Company.

           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of BorgWarner Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;  
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal controls over financial reporting.
