    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION 

NeuStar, Inc. (the Company or Neustar) offers authoritative, hard-to-replicate data sets and proprietary analytics that provide insights to help clients promote and protect their businesses.  The Company s proprietary, cloud-based platforms and differentiated data sets offer informative, real-time analytics, which enable clients to make actionable, data-driven decisions.  The Company provides chief marketing officers a comprehensive suite of services to plan their media spend, identify and locate desired customers, invest effectively in marketing campaigns, deliver relevant offers and measure the performance of these activities.  Security professionals use the Company s solutions to maximize web performance and protect against malicious attacks.  The Company enables the exchange of essential operating information across multiple carriers to provision and manage services, assisting clients with fast and accurate order processing and immediate routing of customer inquiries.  The Company provides communications service providers in the United States critical infrastructure that enables the dynamic routing of calls and text messages. 
  On June 21, 2016, the Company announced its intention to separate into two independent and publicly traded companies.  One company will consist of the majority of the Company's Information Services, which consists of Marketing Services, Security Services and related Data Services.  The other company will focus on providing Order Management and Numbering Services.  Order Management and Numbering Services will provide Local Number Portability Administration, number administration and ancillary numbering services as well as order and inventory management solutions.  The Company intends to accomplish the separation through a tax-free spin-off, which the Company expects to occur in 2017.  The separation is subject to final approval by the Company's Board of Directors, as well as a number of market and regulatory conditions, including, among others, effectiveness of the Form 10 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
   
                 2. 
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year.  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions are inherent in the analysis and the measurement of deferred tax assets; identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets; and recoverability of goodwill.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that it believes are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Separation Costs 
  In the second quarter of 2016 the Company announced its intention to separate into two independent and publicly traded companies.  Separation costs are expensed as incurred and include professional fees for outside advisory services including legal, finance, accounting and related services.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 AND 2016 

Reclassifications 
  Within the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reclassified   $9.0 million   from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities related to the exercise of equity awards and presentation of tax benefits to conform with current period presentation.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1. Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets; 
                
    Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
                
    Level 3. Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
     The Company evaluates assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring and non-recurring basis to determine the appropriate level at which to classify them for each reporting period.  Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses.  The Company determines the fair value of its term loan facilities, the 2013 Term Facility (as defined in Note 5), the 2015 Incremental Term Facility (as defined in Note 5) and the Amended 2013 Term Facility (as defined in Note 5), using pricing service quotations as quoted by Bloomberg (Level 2) (see Note 5).  The Company believes the carrying value of its Amended 2013 Revolving Facility (as defined in Note 5) approximates the fair value of the debt as the term and interest rate approximates the market rate (Level 2) (see Note 5).  The Company determines the fair value of its Senior Notes using a secondary market price on the last trading day in each period as quoted by Bloomberg (Level 2) (see Note 5).  
  The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):   

  Restricted Cash 
  As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , cash of   $2.4 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively, was restricted as collateral for certain of the Company s outstanding letters of credit and for deposits on leased facilities. 
  Identifiable Intangible Assets 
  Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used and are periodically reviewed for impairment.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an

intangible asset impairment charge of   $11.1 million   related to an asset group (see  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  below).  There were   no   intangible asset impairment charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  The Company s identifiable intangible assets are amortized as follows:

    Straight-line 

Amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
  In accordance with Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  The Company measures recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets.  Recoverability measurement and estimating undiscounted cash flows are performed at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable cash flows.  If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets, such assets fail the recoverability test and an impairment charge would be recognized and measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value.  Assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company determined that it will discontinue the use of certain technology acquired from Aggregate Knowledge, Inc. (AKI).  The Company performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the carrying amount of the AKI asset group exceeded the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the AKI asset group.  The Company performed a recoverability test, determined that the fair value of these long-lived assets was less than the carrying value, and recorded a total impairment charge of   $11.1 million  , consisting of charges of   $10.1 million   to write down the carrying value of acquired technology and   $1.0 million   to write down the carrying value of customer lists and relationships (see Note 4).  This   $11.1 million   impairment charge is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statement of operations. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Effective 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805): Business Combinations,   which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the standard, with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.  The Company s adoption of this ASU did not impact its consolidated financial statements. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Effective 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This standard clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified on the statement of cash flows.  The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The Company currently intends to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  .  This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies.  ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards.  The standard is effective for interim and

annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.  The Company currently intends to adopt this standard on January 1, 2017 and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  .  ASU 2016-02 requires that long-term lease arrangements be recognized on the balance sheet.  The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  Under this standard, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer by one year the effective dates of the standard.  As a result, the standard will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Companies may adopt the standard as early as the original effective date (i.e. annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016).  Early adoption prior to that date is not permitted.  The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

    NOTES PAYABLE 

Notes payable consist of the following (in thousands):   

  Credit Facilities and Senior Notes 
  On January 22, 2013, the Company entered into a credit facility that provided for a   $325 million   senior secured term loan facility (2013 Term Facility) and a   $200 million   senior secured revolving credit facility (2013 Revolving Facility, and together with the 2013 Term Facility, the 2013 Credit Facilities).  In addition, the Company closed an offering of   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of senior notes (Senior Notes).

  On September 28, 2016, the Company entered into the third amendment to the 2013 Credit Facilities to (i) extend the maturity date of the 2013 Revolving Facility (the Amended 2013 Revolving Facility) to January 22, 2019, (ii) consolidate the remaining principal balance outstanding under the 2013 Term Facility and the 2015 Incremental Term Facility into a single term loan facility (the Amended 2013 Term Facility, and together with the Amended 2013 Revolving Facility, the Amended 2013 Credit Facilities) and provide a maturity date of January 22, 2019, (iii) set the annual amortization percentage of the Amended 2013 Term Facility at   22%   through December 31, 2017 and   10%   thereafter and (iv) lower the eurodollar rate margin and base rate margin for the Amended 2013 Term Facility to (a) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than   2   to 1 after March 1, 2017,   3%   and   2%  , respectively, and (b) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is   2   to 1 or greater,   3.25%   and   2.25%  , respectively. 
  The Company may voluntarily prepay the borrowings under the       Amended 2013 Credit Facilities at any time in minimum amounts of   $1 million   or an integral multiple of   $500,000   in excess thereof.  The Amended 2013 Credit Facilities provide for

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 AND 2016 

mandatory prepayments with the net cash proceeds of certain debt issuances, insurance receipts, and dispositions.  The Amended 2013 Credit Facilities also contain certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which, and so long as such event of default is continuing, the amounts outstanding may, at the option of the required lenders, accrue interest at an increased rate and payments of such outstanding amounts could be accelerated, or other remedies undertaken.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding borrowings under the Amended 2013 Revolving Facility were   $175.0 million   and available borrowings under the same facility were   $7.0 million  , exclusive of outstanding letters of credit totaling   $18.0 million  .  
  Senior Notes 
  On January 22, 2013, the Company closed an offering of   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.50%   senior notes due 2023.  The Senior Notes are the general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of its domestic subsidiaries, or the Subsidiary Guarantors.  Interest is payable on the Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears at an annual rate of   4.50%  , on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2013.  
  If the Company experiences certain changes of control together with a ratings downgrade, it will be required to offer to purchase all of the Senior Notes then outstanding at a purchase price equal to   101.00%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.  If the Company sells certain assets and does not repay certain debt or reinvest the proceeds of such sales within certain time periods, it will be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes with such proceeds at   100.00%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.  
  The Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including among other things, payment default, failure to provide certain notices and defaults related to bankruptcy events.  The Senior Notes also contain customary negative covenants. 
  Future Principal Payments 
  Future principal payments under the Amended 2013 Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016  , are as follows (in thousands): 

In October 2016, the Company made   $40.0 million   in voluntary prepayments towards the outstanding principal balance of its Amended 2013 Credit Facilities.  
  Deferred Financing Costs  
  On September 28, 2016, the Company amended its 2013 Credit Facilities.  Certain creditors in the 2013 Term Facility and the 2015 Incremental Term Facility reinvested in the Amended 2013 Term Facility and the change in the present value of future cash flows between the investments was less than 10%.  Accordingly, the Company accounted for this refinancing event for these creditors as a debt modification.  Previously deferred fees and costs for existing debt will be amortized over the term of the Amended 2013 Term Facility.  Fees paid to the creditors in connection with the amendment were included in the loss on debt extinguishment.   The proportionate fees incurred with third parties directly related to the modification were included in debt modification expense.  Certain investors in the 2013 Term Facility and the 2015 Incremental Term Facility either did not invest in the Amended 2013 Term Facility or the change in the present value of future cash flows between the investments was greater than 10%.  Accordingly, the Company accounted for this refinancing event for these investors as a debt extinguishment.  Previously deferred fees and costs for existing debt were included in the loss on debt extinguishment.  Fees paid to the creditors in connection with the amendment will be amortized over the term of the Amended 2013 Term Facility. The proportionate fees incurred with third parties directly related to the modification will be amortized over the term of the Amended 2013 Term Facility.

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 AND 2016 

Further, the borrowing capacity of certain investors under the Amended 2013 Revolving Facility was greater than or equal to the borrowing capacity under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  Accordingly, fees and costs incurred related to the amendment on September 28, 2016, as well as unamortized deferred financing costs, associated with the 2013 Revolving Facility, will be amortized over the term of the Amended 2013 Revolving Facility.  The borrowing capacity of certain investors under the Amended 2013 Credit Facility was less than the borrowing capacity under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  Accordingly, fees paid in 2016 to the creditor and third-party costs incurred in connection with the amendment on September 28, 2016 will be amortized over the term of the Amended 2013 Revolving Facility.  Unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2013 Revolving Facility were written off in proportion to an investor's decrease in borrowing capacity.   
  In applying debt modification accounting, the Company recorded $  6.4 million   in interest and other expense, comprised of   $6.0 million   in loss on debt extinguishment and   $0.4 million   in debt modification expense, in connection with this refinancing event. 
   
                 6. 
    STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 

As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   2,736,526   shares were available for grant or award under the Company s stock incentive plans and a total of   176,474   shares were available to be issued under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  On June 15, 2016, at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved a proposal to make an additional   3,000,000   shares available for grant under the Company s stock incentive plans.  These shares will become available for grant once registered on a Form S-8 filed with the SEC. 
  Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   was   $10.4 million   and   $11.6 million  , respectively, and   $28.1 million   and   $32.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense was estimated at   $54.6 million  , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately   1.4   years.  Total unrecognized compensation expense as of September 30, 2016 is estimated based on outstanding non-vested stock options, non-vested restricted stock units and non-vested performance vested restricted stock units (PVRSUs).  Stock-based compensation expense may increase or decrease in future periods for subsequent grants or forfeitures. 
  Stock Options 
  The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted.  The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity:   

  The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.0 million  . 
  Performance Vested Restricted Stock Units 
  The fair value of a PVRSU is measured by reference to the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant.  The Company recognizes the estimated fair value of PVRSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period, which considers each performance period or tranche separately, based upon the Company s determination of the level of achievement of the performance target.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company revised its estimate of the level of achievement of the performance target for the 2016 performance year, resulting in a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  The

Company s consolidated net income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $53.0 million   and   $122.5 million  , respectively, and diluted net income per common share was   $0.96   and   $2.22   per share, respectively.  If the Company had continued to use the previous estimate of achievement for each respective period, the as adjusted net income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   would have been approximately   $52.2 million   and   $121.0 million  , respectively, and the as adjusted diluted net income per common share would have been approximately   $0.94   and   $2.19   per share, respectively. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s non-vested PVRSU activity for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016:   

  The aggregate intrinsic value of PVRSUs vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $21.8 million  .  The Company repurchased   339,783   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $8.4 million   pursuant to the participants  rights under the Company s stock incentive plans to elect to use common stock to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations. 
  Restricted Stock Units 
  The following table summarizes the Company s restricted stock units activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :   

  The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $13.0 million  .  The Company repurchased   191,249   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $4.6 million   pursuant to the participants  rights under the Company s stock incentive plans to elect to use common stock to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations.

    BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted net income per common share (in thousands, except per share data):   

  Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution of common stock equivalents such as options and warrants, to the extent the impact is dilutive.  Common stock options to purchase an aggregate of   754,059   and   1,190,512   shares were excluded from the calculation of the denominator for diluted net income per common share due to their anti-dilutive effect for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Common stock options to purchase an aggregate of   776,001   and   1,433,707   shares were excluded from the calculation of the denominator for diluted net income per common share due to their anti-dilutive effect for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

    RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 

2016 Restructuring 
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $2.6 million   and   $11.4 million  , respectively, related to estimated severance and severance-related costs.   
   
                 9. 
    INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE 

Interest and other expense consists of the following (in thousands):   

The Company s effective tax rate, including discrete tax benefits of   $26.4 million  , decreased to   17.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   35.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a discrete

income tax benefit of   $23.1 million   recorded in the third quarter of 2016 for a worthless stock deduction associated with the liquidation of one of the Company s domestic subsidiaries for tax purposes.  The Company intends to treat the common stock of this subsidiary as worthless for U.S. income tax purposes on its 2016 U.S. federal and state income tax returns.   
  As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of   $7.5 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively, of which   $6.9 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively, would affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized. 
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, potential interest and penalties were insignificant.  Interest and penalties are primarily due to uncertain tax positions assumed in acquisitions.  To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.  
  The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.  The tax years 2009 through 2015 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.  During the first quarter of 2016, the IRS completed an examination of the 2010 federal income tax return of Neustar Information Services, Inc.  No adjustments were made as a result of the audit.  
  The Company anticipates that the amount of reasonably possible unrecognized tax benefits that could decrease over the next 12 months due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and settlement of tax audits is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
   
                 11. 
    SEGMENT INFORMATION 

The Company engages in business activities as a single entity and the chief operating decision maker reviews consolidated operating results and allocates resources based on consolidated reports.  The Company has a single operating segment.

    SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION 

The following schedules present condensed consolidating financial information of the Company as of December 31,   2015   and   September 30, 2016   and for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   for (a) Neustar, Inc., the parent company; (b) certain of the Company s 100% owned domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Subsidiary Guarantors); and (c) certain wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries).  Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method; accordingly, entries necessary to consolidate the parent company and all of the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries are reflected in the eliminations column.  Intercompany amounts that will not be settled between entities are treated as contributions or distributions for purposes of these condensed consolidated financial statements.  The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.  A Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its obligations under the Senior Notes when: (a) the Subsidiary Guarantor is sold or sells substantially all of its assets; (b) the Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined by the Senior Notes; (c) the Subsidiary Guarantor s guarantee of indebtedness under the Senior Notes is released (other than discharge through repayment); or (d) the requirements for legal or covenant defeasance or discharge of the indenture have been satisfied.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements concerning the conditions in our industries, our operations and economic performance, and our business and growth strategy.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   expects,   intends,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential,   continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or predict.  These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by our management that we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those described in this report, in Part II,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
  Overview 
  Planned Company Separation 
  On June 21, 2016, we announced our intention to separate into two independent and publicly traded companies.  One company will consist of the majority of our Information Services, which consists of Marketing Services, Security Services and related Data Services.  The other company will focus on providing Order Management and Numbering Services.  Order Management and Numbering Services will provide Local Number Portability Administration, number administration and ancillary numbering services as well as order and inventory management solutions.  We intend to accomplish the separation through a tax-free spin-off, which we expect to occur in 2017.  The separation is subject to final approval by our Board of Directors, as well as a number of market and regulatory conditions, including, among others, effectiveness of the Form 10 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
  Third Quarter 2016 Activity 
  During the third quarter, we expanded our highly competitive solutions by entering into new strategic partnerships.  In particular, we entered into an advanced marketing analytics partnership with Facebook and now have a differentiated solution that chief marketing officers can rely on for attribution across various channels and for intelligent planning of marketing spend.  In addition, we developed new features for our DDoS protection solution.  These features provide improved speed and flexibility through enhanced automation of traffic flows, management and visibility.  
  During the third quarter, we generated revenue of   $300.1 million  , an increase of   15%   from   $261.7 million   in the third quarter of 2015.  This increase was driven by revenue from our 2015 acquisitions and continued demand for our solutions.  Our Marketing Services revenue for the quarter increased   54%   to   $63.3 million   from   $41.1 million   in the third quarter of 2015, and included revenue from the acquisition of MarketShare.  Our Security Services revenue increased   18%   to   $51.0 million   from   $43.2 million   in the third quarter of 2015, and included revenue from the acquisition of Bombora Technologies.  Our Data Services revenue increased   14%   to   $58.2 million   from   $51.2 million  , and included revenue from the caller authentication assets acquired from TNS.  Our NPAC Services revenue increased   1%   to   $127.6 million   from   $126.2 million   due to revenue from transition services under our contracts to provide Local Number Portability Administrator, or LNPA, services. 
  In addition to our continued growth in revenue, we improved our financial structure through the refinancing of our credit facilities.  Specifically, we amended the terms of our 2013 Credit Facility to include a lower interest rate of LIBOR plus 325 basis points, subject to a pricing grid, and a reduced annual amortization of 22% until the end of 2017 and 10% thereafter.  We also extended the maturity date by one year to January 22, 2019.  This refinancing provides us with a lower cost of debt and greater financial flexibility. 
  On March 26, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, approved a competitor to serve as the next LNPA and authorized the North American Portability Management LLC, or NAPM, to begin contract negotiations with that competitor.  On April 6, 2015, we filed a Petition for Review asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to  hold unlawful, vacate, enjoin, and set aside  the FCC s Order approving the North American Numbering Counsel s recommendation.  On June 19, 2015, the Court of Appeals granted the requests made by third-party petitioners to intervene in the case.  On July 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals dismissed the FCC s motion to hold the case in abeyance pending further FCC action and ruled that the issues raised in the FCC s motion to dismiss should be addressed in the parties  briefs on the  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

merits.  We filed our initial brief on September 21, 2015, the briefing schedule concluded on December 17, 2015, and oral argument before the Court of Appeals took place on September 13, 2016. 
  On April 7, 2015, we amended our seven regional contracts with the NAPM.  Under this amendment, we will provide LNPA services for an annual fixed fee of $496.1 million until the termination of these contracts.  In addition to LNPA services, we are providing certain transition services under this amendment on a cost-plus basis.  On July 1, 2016, we received a notice of non-renewal from the NAPM informing us of its election not to renew the master agreements that expire on September 30, 2016.  On July 25, 2016 the FCC issued an Order approving the proposed contract between the NAPM and a competitor to serve as the next LNPA.  On September 29, 2016, the NAPM provided notice to extend the term of our master contracts with NAPM and opted not to license the source code that we use to provide services to the NAPM.  We will continue to provide services and transition services at the pricing terms under the current contracts until the NAPM provides at least one termination notice to us, which must establish a termination date that is 180 days after the date of notice.  We cannot be certain how long we will provide LNPA services; however, we will continue to provide services under the current terms of the NAPM contracts for as long as required by NAPM.  On April 20, 2016, the NAPM Transition Oversight Manager, or the TOM, published a preliminary transition timeline which extends the transition through the third quarter of 2017.  The TOM subsequently issued a revised timeline that extends the transition through May 25, 2018.  Based on this timeline, we do not expect that the NAPM will provide us with a termination notice establishing a termination date occurring during the next twelve months. 
  Prior to the April 2015 amendment, we provided LNPA services under our contracts with NAPM for a fixed fee with a 6.5% annual price escalator.  These contracts were due to expire on June 30, 2015.  The 2015 LNPA service fixed fee under the prior contract terms represents the impact of a 6.5% annual escalator on the 2014 LNPA service fixed fee of $465.8 million, resulting in a 2015 LNPA service fixed fee of $496.1 million.  Under the April 7, 2015 amendment, the annual LNPA service fixed fee remains the same at $496.1 million for the duration of the amended term of the contracts.  As a result, the amendment will not have an impact on our revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  Loss of the NPAC contracts will have a material adverse impact on our future operating results when compared to our current financial profile.  We expect to lose approximately $500 million of annual revenue and this loss will adversely impact our income from operations and operating margin.  Additionally, this loss may have a disproportionate material negative impact on our operating margin because of the largely fixed and shared cost structure that is designed to support all of our services.  As a result of the uncertain contract end date and due to our cost structure, which is organized by function, we are currently analyzing the impact of the termination of the contracts on our income from operations in an effort to quantify such impacts.  Our disclosure will expand as we evaluate the cost structure that will be in place to support our ongoing business or as we learn more about the timing of the contract termination.  
  Given the facts and circumstances described above, we determined that the structure of our organization is appropriate at this time. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.  We have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board of Directors, and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report. 
  Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable, actual results may differ from those estimates.  In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time, we reasonably could have used different estimates in the current period.  Changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.  If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.  See the information in our filings with the SEC from time to time, including Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for our quarter ended June 30, 2016, or June 2016 10-Q, filed with the SEC on July 28, 2016, for certain matters that may bear on our results of operations.

  Consolidated Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016    
  The following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  :   

  Revenue 
  Revenue.    Revenue increased   $38.4 million   driven by revenue from acquisitions closed in 2015 and demand for our Marketing and Security Services.  Revenue from our Marketing Services increased   $22.2 million   driven by a $14.9 million contribution from MarketShare, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, and increased demand for our services that our clients use to make informed and high impact decisions to promote their products and services.   
  Security Services revenue increased   $7.9 million   driven by an increase in revenue of $4.7 million from domain name registries and an increase in revenue of $3.1 million resulting from demand for our DNS services.  The increase in revenue from domain name registries was driven by $3.4 million from the acquisition of Bombora Technologies completed on July 30, 2015.  The remaining increase in domain name registries was driven by continued growth in the number of domain names under management.   
  Data Services revenue increased   $7.0 million  .  Revenue from caller identification services increased $19.5 million driven by a $15.9 million contribution from the caller authentication assets we acquired from TNS.  This increase was partially offset by a $10.0 million decrease in revenue from the expiration of our contract to serve as the registry operator for U.S. Common

Short Codes in 2015.  In addition, revenue from user authentication and rights managements services decreased $2.6 million. 
  Revenue from our NPAC Services increased   $1.4 million   driven by revenue from transition services under our contracts to provide LNPA services. 
  Expense 
  Cost of revenue.    Cost of revenue increased   $26.5 million  , including $18.4 million of operating expense related to acquisitions.  This increase of   $26.5 million   was due to an increase of $15.3 million in costs related to our information technology and systems and an increase of $8.3 million in personnel and personnel-related expense.  The increase in costs related to our information technology and systems was driven by increased data processing, telecommunications, maintenance and hardware costs.  The increase of $8.3 million in personnel and personnel-related expense was due to a $7.9 million increase in personnel costs driven by headcount growth and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation.  In addition, royalty costs increased $1.7 million and contractor costs increased $1.1 million. 
  Sales and marketing.    Sales and marketing expense increased   $1.9 million  , including $7.1 million of operating expense related to acquisitions.  This increase of   $1.9 million   was due to an increase of $3.5 million in personnel and personnel-related expense and an increase of $0.3 million in maintenance and general facilities costs.  The increase of $3.5 million in personnel and personnel-related expense was due to a $3.8 million increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in advertising and marketing costs. 
  Research and development.    Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was comparable to the research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  General and administrative.    General and administrative expense decreased   $0.6 million  , including $1.4 million of operating expense related to acquisitions completed in 2015.  This decrease of   $0.6 million   was due to a decrease of $2.3 million in professional fees, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in general facilities costs and an increase of $0.3 million in personnel and personnel-related expense.  The decrease in professional fees was driven by a reduction of costs to pursue new business opportunities.  The increase of $0.3 million in personnel and personnel-related expense was due to a $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in personnel costs. 
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $19.4 million  , including $7.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to assets acquired as part of our 2015 acquisitions.  During the quarter, we recorded an $11.1 million impairment charge to write down long-lived intangible assets.  Amortization expense increased $7.3 million related to other acquired intangible assets.  In addition, depreciation expense increased $1.0 million. 
  Restructuring charges.    Restructuring charges increased   $2.6 million   in connection with a restructuring initiated in the third quarter of 2016 to achieve efficiencies in connection with the integration of our recent acquisitions and the review of our go-to-market strategy. 
  Separation costs.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred separation costs of   $2.1 million  .  In the second quarter of 2016, we announced our intention to separate into two independent and publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off.  Separation costs recorded in the third quarter related to activities supporting the planned separation.  These costs include professional fees for outside advisory services including legal, finance, accounting and related services.  
  Interest and other expense.    Interest and other expense increased   $15.4 million   due to an increase of   $8.7 million   in interest expense, a   $6.4 million   loss on debt modification and extinguishment recorded in connection with the Amended 2013 Credit Facilities, and a net increase of   $0.4 million   in foreign currency transaction losses.  The increase in interest expense was driven by borrowings under the 2015 Incremental Term Facility and an increase in the interest rate under our 2013 Term Facility.  On September 28, 2016, we amended our credit facilities and among other things, consolidated the remaining principal outstanding under our 2013 Term Facility and our 2015 Incremental Term Facility into a single term loan facility, or the Amended 2013 Term Facility.   
  Interest income.    Interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was comparable to the interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
  Provision (benefit) for income taxes.    Our effective tax rate, including discrete items, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   (17.8)%  , a decrease from   32.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the third quarter of 2016, we liquidated one of our domestic subsidiaries for tax purposes.  We intend to treat the common stock of this subsidiary as worthless for U.S. income tax purposes on our 2016 U.S. federal and state income tax returns.  We recorded a discrete tax benefit of $23.1 million associated with this worthless stock deduction in the third quarter of 2016.  Excluding all

  The following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  :   

  Revenue 
  Revenue.    Revenue increased   $115.1 million   driven by revenue from acquisitions closed in 2015 and demand for our Marketing and Security Services.  Revenue from our Marketing Services increased   $65.6 million   driven by a $40.6 million contribution from MarketShare, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, and increased demand for our services that help clients make informed and high impact decisions to promote their products and services.   
  Security Services revenue increased   $25.7 million   driven by an increase in revenue of $21.7 million from domain name registries and an increase in revenue of $4.0 million resulting from demand for our DNS services.  The increase in revenue from domain name registries was driven by $16.5 million from the acquisition of Bombora Technologies completed on July 30, 2015, which included $4.1 million in revenue resulting from the consolidation of the customer base.  The remaining increase in domain name registries was driven by continued growth in the number of domain names under management.   
  Data Services revenue increased   $18.5 million  .  Revenue from caller identification services increased $55.7 million driven by a $48.2 million contribution from the caller authentication assets we acquired from TNS.  This increase was partially offset by a $29.0 million decrease in revenue from the expiration of our contract to serve as the registry operator for U.S. Common Short Codes in 2015.  In addition, revenue from user authentication and rights managements services decreased $5.5 million, and revenue from carrier provisioning services decreased $2.7 million due to the completion of client projects.

  Expense 
  Cost of revenue.    Cost of revenue increased   $76.3 million  , including $60.9 million of operating expense related to acquisitions.  This increase of   $76.3 million   was due to an increase of $39.1 million in costs related to our information technology and systems and an increase of $27.9 million in personnel and personnel-related expense.  The increase in costs related to our information technology and systems was driven by increased data processing, telecommunications, maintenance and hardware costs.

  Sales and marketing.    Sales and marketing expense increased   $13.8 million  , including $27.1 million of operating expense related to acquisitions.

  Research and development.    Research and development expense increased   $0.4 million  , including $2.1 million of operating expense related to acquisitions.  This increase of   $0.4 million   was due to personnel and personnel-related expense.  
  General and administrative.    General and administrative expense increased   $4.8 million  , including $6.3 million of operating expense related to acquisitions completed in 2015.  This increase of   $4.8 million   was due to an increase of $2.9 million in personnel and personnel-related costs, a $2.1 million gain from the sale of certain and assets and liabilities in the second quarter of 2015 with no comparable benefit in the second quarter of 2016, and an increase of $2.1 million in general facilities costs.  The increase of $2.9 million in personnel and personnel-related expense was due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel costs and a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation.  These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in professional fees. 
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $37.4 million  , including $21.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to assets acquired as part of our 2015 acquisitions.  During the third quarter, we recorded an $11.1 million impairment charge to write down long-lived intangible assets.

  Separation costs.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred separation costs of   $6.4 million  .

The increase in interest expense was driven by borrowings under the 2015 Incremental Term Facility and an increase in the interest rate under our 2013 Term Facility.  On September 28, 2016, we amended our credit facilities and among other things, consolidated the remaining principal outstanding under our 2013 Term Facility and our 2015 Incremental Term Facility into a single term loan facility, or the Amended 2013 Term Facility.   
  Interest income.    Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was comparable to the interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

During the third quarter of 2016, we liquidated one of our domestic subsidiaries for tax purposes.  We intend to treat the common stock of this subsidiary as worthless for U.S. income tax purposes on our 2016 U.S. federal and state income tax returns.  We recorded a discrete tax benefit of $23.1 million associated with this worthless stock deduction in the third quarter of 2016.  Excluding all

discrete tax items, our effective tax rate was approximately   35.1%   and 36.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by our operating and financing activities.  Our principal uses of cash have been to fund acquisitions, share repurchases, debt service requirements and capital expenditures.  We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for debt service requirements and capital expenditures.  Total cash and cash equivalents were   $56.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $32.9 million   from   $89.1 million   at December 31,   2015  .  This decrease in cash and cash equivalents was driven by cash used to reduce the outstanding principal under the 2013 Credit Facilities, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities.  
  We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.   
  Credit Facilities  
  On January 22, 2013, we entered into a credit facility that provided for a $325 million senior secured term loan facility, or 2013 Term Facility, and a $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2013 Revolving Facility, and together with the 2013 Term Facility, the 2013 Credit Facilities.  In addition, we closed an offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, or Senior Notes.  On December 9, 2015, we amended our 2013 Credit Facilities to provide for a $350 million incremental term loan, or the 2015 Incremental Term Facility.  On September 28, 2016 we further amended our 2013 Credit Facilities to (i) consolidate the remaining principal outstanding under our 2013 Term Facility and our 2015 Incremental Term Facility into a single term loan facility, (ii) provide a maturity date of January 22, 2019, (iii) set the annual amortization percentage of the Amended 2013 Term Facility at 22% through December 31, 2017 and 10% thereafter and (iv) lower the eurodollar rate margin and base rate margin for the Amended 2013 Term Facility to (a) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 2 to 1 after March 1, 2017, 3.00% and 2.00%, respectively, and (b) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is 2 to 1 or greater, 3.25% and 2.25%, respectively.  The third amendment also provides that upon consummation of a spin-off separating our business into two separate companies, the commitments under the revolving credit facility will be permanently reduced to zero and we must prepay all outstanding advances under the Amended 2013 Credit Facilities. 
  For further discussion of this debt, refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 5 to our Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report. 
  Discussion of Cash Flows  
  Cash flows from operations 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $208.7 million  , as compared to   $250.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This $  42.0 million   decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was the result of a decrease in net income of   $19.0 million  , an increase in non-cash adjustments of   $74.2 million   and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $97.2 million  . 
  Non-cash adjustments increased   $74.2 million  , driven by an increase of   $37.4 million   in depreciation and amortization expense, an increase of   $15.5 million   in deferred income taxes, an increase of   $10.9 million   in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount on debt, a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of   $6.4 million   recorded in the fourth quarter related to our Amended 2013 Credit Facilities, an increase of   $4.0 million   in stock-based compensation, a decrease of   $0.7 million   in gain on asset disposals, and a decrease of   $0.1 million   in tax benefit from equity awards.  These total increases of $75.0 million in non-cash adjustments were partially offset by a decrease of   $0.6 million   in the provision for doubtful accounts.   
  Cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased   $97.2 million   primarily due to a decrease of   $42.3 million   in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a decrease of   $37.6 million   in income taxes, a net increase of   $22.3 million   in accounts and unbilled receivables, a decrease of   $7.2 million   in other liabilities, and a decrease of   $3.0 million   in deferred costs.  These total decreases of $112.4 million in net changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by an increase of   $7.4 million   in deferred revenue, an increase of   $4.4 million   in other assets, and an increase of   $3.4 million   in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Cash flows from investing 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $38.0 million  , as compared to   $106.6 million   for   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   $68.6 million   decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to a decrease of   $84.1 million   in cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by an increase of   $15.6 million   in cash used for purchases of property and equipment. 
  Cash flows from financing 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $204.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $111.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   $92.3 million   increase in net cash used in financing activities was due to an increase of   $173.1 million   in principal payments under our 2013 Credit Facilities, an increase of   $10.2 million   in debt issuance costs, a decrease of   $7.1 million   in cash proceeds from the issuance of stock, an increase of   $0.7 million   in cash used in principal repayments on capital lease obligations, and a decrease of   $0.1 million   in tax benefit from equity awards.  These total increases of $191.2 million in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease of   $98.6 million   in cash used for share repurchases and for the net down of employee shares and cash provided of   $0.3 million   due to a net change in restricted cash.

    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about our market risk, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2015. 
   
                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at the reasonable assurance level. 
  In addition, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the   third   quarter of   2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
                 Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

On April 6, 2015, we filed a Petition for Review asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to  hold unlawful, vacate, enjoin, and set aside  the FCC Order issued on March 27, 2015, approving a recommendation by the North American Numbering Council for a competitor to serve as the next LNPA.  Among other things, we believe the FCC Order violates the notice and comment rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, violates the FCC s rules by selecting an entity that is not impartial or neutral to serve as the next LNPA and is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise contrary to law.  On June 19, 2015, the Court of Appeals granted the requests made by third-party petitioners to intervene in the case.  On July 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals dismissed the FCC s motion to hold the case in abeyance pending further FCC action and ruled that the issues raised in the FCC s motion to dismiss should be addressed in the parties  briefs on the merits.  We filed our initial brief on September 21, 2015, the briefing schedule concluded on December 17, 2015, and oral argument before the Court of Appeals took place on September 13, 2016.

  CERTIFICATION 
  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
  I, Lisa A. Hook, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of NeuStar, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
