   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS   

Illumitry Corp. ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 17, 2014. We are a development-stage company formed to commence operations in a field of embroidery on fabric, furnishings, and clothing in Armenia.  

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company had limited revenues and incurred losses as of September 30, 2016.  The Company currently has negative working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.  

The Company s unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the period shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis of presentation    

  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.

A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  

Revenue Recognition

   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

  AS topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  

These tiers include:  

Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

  Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  

  Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

The carrying value of cash and the Company s loan from shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.  

Use of Estimates      

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Stock-Based Compensation   

  Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.  

Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   

  The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260  Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  

Comprehensive Income   

  Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders' deficit, exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments. Comprehensive income includes net income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as translation adjustments on investments in foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. As of September 30, 2016 there were no differences between our comprehensive loss and net loss.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

  We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.  

NOTE 4   LOAN FROM DIRECTOR   

As of September 30, 2016 our sole director has loaned to the Company $11,400 pursuant to the Verbal Agreement. This loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.  

The balance due to the director was $11,400 as of September 30, 2016.

   FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

NOTE 9   INCOME TAXES   

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $19,628 and $8,978 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income in varying amounts through 2031. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.  

The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following:  

The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows:  

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately   $19,628 as of September 30, 2016 compare to $8,978 as of December 31, 2015   for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.

In accordance with ASC 855-10 the Company has analyzed its operations from       September 30, 2016 to October 17, 2016, the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

GENERAL   

Illumitry Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 17, 2014 and established a fiscal yearend of December 31. We have generated limited revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a development-stage company formed to commence operations in a field of embroidery on fabric and cloth in Armenia.   

PRODUCT   

Our product can be represented as embroidery products. Embroidery products include, but are not limited to: logos on work wear, images on cloth, patches, embroidery on hats, jackets, and on linen, blankets, leather upholstery and others.  Our embroidery machine operates through the computer and which allows us to embroider on almost any kind of item.  The main product of our production is embroidery on fabric. With our embroidery you can complete your appearance with the special embroidery label on your cloth which you could create by your own, making it the perfect finishing touch in a total view and make you feel unique. For big companies it is very useful to make them more known and recognizable.  

We plan to enter the market with embroidery production assortment. Illumitry Corp. specializes in embroidery production, oriented on potential customers. In Armenia, embroidery is a main part of the traditional Armenian clothing, which makes our business more attractive for customers.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  

We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES            

As at   September 30, 2016  , our total assets were $7,104. Total assets were comprised of $3,413 in current assets and $3,691 in fixed assets.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING    

Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve months period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of shares of our common stock, from selling our products and from our sole officer and director loan. Ms.       Sukiasyan, our sole officer and director, has agreed to land funds to the Company. She has signed an agreement which evidencing the obligation loan funds to the Company if it is needed in case of not raising sufficient funds from this offering.
