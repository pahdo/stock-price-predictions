NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION  

Next Graphite, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated in Nevada on September 26, 2012 under the name Zewar Jewellery, Inc. and is a development-stage entity. The Company's
current business plan is to engage in the mining business developing graphite properties located in Namibia. The Company is based
in Carson City, Nevada. 

On November 14, 2013, the Company consummated
transactions pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) dated November 14, 2013 by and
among the Company and the stockholders of African Graphite, Inc., a private Nevada corporation ( AGI  and the  AGI
Stockholders ) whereby AGI Stockholders transferred 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of AGI held by them,
in exchange for an aggregate of 8,980,047 newly issued shares of the Company s common stock, par value $.0001 per share
(the  Common Stock ). 

On November 14, 2013, AGI entered into a Stock
Purchase Option Agreement (the  Option Agreement ) with NMC Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of the Province
of Ontario, Canada ( NMC ), whereby NMC granted to AGI an option to purchase 90 ordinary shares, par value one Namibian
dollar per share, of Gazania Investments Two Hundred and Forty Two (Proprietary) Limited, a corporation organized under the laws
of the Republic of Namibia ( Gazania ), representing 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Gazania, for $240,000.
NMC had entered into an option agreement dated March 29, 2013, as amended on November 4, 2013 (the  Centre Agreement ),
with Centre for Geoscience Research CC (formerly known as  Industrial Minerals and Rock Research Centre CC ), a company
organized under the laws of the Republic of Namibia ( Centre ), whereby Centre agreed to transfer to Gazania 100% undivided
interest in the exclusive prospecting license No. 3895 known as AUKAM originally issued to Centre by the government of the Republic
of Namibia on April 4, 2011 and renewed on April 4, 2013 (the  License ). The License grants the right to conduct
prospecting operations, bulk sampling and pilot production in the license area called AUKAM located in southern Namibia in the
Karas Region within the Betaine district. The license area covers about 49,127 hectares. The only mine in Namibia which has produced
graphite is situated in the license area. The transfer of the License to Gazania was approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy
of the Republic of Namibia on February 25, 2014. 

Under the Option Agreement, AGI was required
to pay to NMC $90,000 as an advance payment to be credited towards the purchase price of the Gazania shares. The Company made
the advance payment on November 14, 2013. The balance of the purchase price in the amount of $150,000 was paid by AGI upon exercise
of the option that was completed on March 14, 2014. As a result, Gazania became a direct 90% owned subsidiary of the Company. 

The Company acquired the remaining 10% ownership
of Gazania for $15,000 in the third quarter of 2015. As a result, Gazania became a direct 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates
continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred approximately $4,978,329 in operating deficit since its
inception, and has generated no operating revenue, which could raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

In view of these matters, realization
of the assets of the Company is dependent upon the Company s ability to meet its financial requirements through equity financing
and the success of future operations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue in existence. 

NOTE 3   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and are presented in accordance with the requirements
of Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain
all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, the results
of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto
for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016.  The operating
results or cash flows for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
any other interim period or the full year.  

NOTE 4   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Use
of Estimates   

The preparation
of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue
and Customer Deposits   

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition,  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable,
collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered. The Company did not have
product sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

The Company received customer deposit for
potential usage of Company s license in the amount of $85,481 and $60,491 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. 

Income Taxes    

Provisions for income taxes are based
on taxes payable or refundable and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and tax operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are included in the financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain
tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions are judged to not meet the  more-likely-than-not 
threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions
are included as a component of general and administrative expense. 

Basic and Diluted Loss per Common
Share     

Basic loss per common share amounts
are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted
loss per share amounts are computed assuming the issuance of common stock for potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheets for accounts payable, and related party payables approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported for convertible notes payable approximate fair value based
on the value of the common stock into which the notes are convertible. The carrying amounts reported for notes payable approximate
fair value because the underlying instruments are at interest rates that approximate current market rates. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial
instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level
    1   Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company
    holds. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
    sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.   

Level
    2   Valuation based on quoted prices in markets that are not active for which all significant inputs are observable,
    either directly or indirectly.   

Level
    3   Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.   

Financial instruments include cash,
accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued
expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short term maturities of these instruments. 

The Company has Level 3 financial instrument,
an embedded derivative liability (beneficial conversion feature) that is recorded at fair value on periodic basis. The embedded
derivative is evaluated under the hierarchy of ASC 480-10, ASC Paragraph 815-25-1 and ASC Subparagraph 815-10-15-74 addressing
embedded derivatives. The fair value of such Level 3 financial instrument is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The foregoing Level 3 financial instrument has certain provisions which qualifies to be classified as a liability under
ASC 815. 

As of September 30, 2016, the following
table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for items that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring
basis: 

As of December 31, 2015, the following
table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for items that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring
basis: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In March 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09,  Compensation  
Stock Compensation  (Topic 718) : Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This ASU is intended to simplify
several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The provisions of this ASU are effective
for years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
this ASU. 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842). This ASU would require lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception
of short-term leases) at the commencement date; (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments
arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s
right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under the amendments
of this ASU. The provisions of this ASU are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this ASU. 

 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . This ASU establishes
specific guidance to an organization s management on their responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt
about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern. The provisions of ASU 2014-15 are effective for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This ASU is not expected to have an impact on the Company s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 

 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606). The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing
revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue
issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets;
and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. On August
12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, deferring the effective date by one year for ASU No. 2014-09. The provisions of ASU
No. 2014-09 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. 

NOTE 5   ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31,
2015, the Company s accounts payable was primarily made up of professional fees.  

NOTE 6   NOTES PAYABLE  

The Company had the following notes
payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The
notes payable with the maturity date that has matured at the time the financial statements are issued continued to accrue interest
and no default penalties were incurred. Interest expense for notes payable amounted to $1,833 and $0 for the quarters (3 months)
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

NOTE 7   NOTES
PAYABLE   RELATED PARTY  

The Company had the following related
party notes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Interest
expense for notes payable-related party amounted to $204 and $0 for the quarter (3 months) ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

NOTE 8   CONVERTIBLE NOTES
PAYABLE  

The Company issued convertible notes
payable. The outstanding balance and any accrued interest is due on maturity date or when the cash is available to repay the notes
payable. Under the agreement, the notes can be convertible at the holder s discretion into common shares of the Company s
stock at a 25% discount to the price at the date of exercise. 

The Company s convertible notes
payable is as follows: 

The convertible notes with the maturity
date that has matured at the time the financial statements are issued continued to accrue interest and no default penalties were
incurred. The Company incurred $1,683 and $0 of interest expense for the quarter (3 months) ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
No convertible notes were converted as of September 30, 2016 and up to the date the financial statements are issued. 

The Company adopted the provisions
of FASB ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging  ( ASC 815 ) (previously EITF 07-5,  Determining
Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity s Own Stock ), as the convertible note agreement
contained certain provision that the convertible note failed to pass the  fixed for fixed  criteria of ASC815, the
conversion feature of the convertible debt should have to be bifurcated and recorded separately until the conversion date. 

Based on ASC 815, the Company determined
that the convertible debt contained embedded derivatives and full-ratchet provision which the Company valued the embedded derivative
using the Black-Scholes method. The following table represents fair value of embedded derivative movement from the date of issuance
to September 30, 2016: 

As
a result of initial recording of derivative liability of $41,000 for convertible notes issued in 2015 with proceeds of $49,000
the Company recorded debt discount of $30,500 at the date of issuance of convertible note payable for issuances occurred in 2015.
The Company recorded additional debt discount of $10,500 in June 2015 to true up the debt discount balance. The original debt
discount amount of $30,500 should have been recorded as $41,000. The Company accretes debt discount of $41,000 for convertible
notes issued in 2015 and $70,334 for convertible note issued in 2014 over the life of the convertible note. The Company recorded
accretion of $5,483 and $0 for the three months ended on September 30, 2016 and 2015 which is recorded as interest expense.  

The
following table represents fair value of embedded derivative movement from the date of issuance to December 31, 2015:  

As a result of initial recording of
derivative liability of $30,500 for convertible notes issued in 2015 with proceeds of $49,000 the Company recorded debt discount
of $30,500 at the date of issuance of convertible note payable for issuances occurred in 2015. The Company accretes debt discount
of $30,500 for convertible notes issued in 2015 and $70,334 for convertible note issued in 2014 over the life of the convertible
note.  

NOTE 9   PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  

The Company recognizes the tax effects of
transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income regardless of when reported for
tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided in the financial statements under FASB 740-10-65-1 to give effect to the temporary differences
which may arise from differences in the bases of fixed assets, depreciation methods and allowances based on the income taxes expected
to be payable in future years. Minimal development stage deferred tax assets arising as a result of net operating loss carry-forwards
have been offset completely by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of their utilization in future periods. 

The Company recognizes interest accrued relative
to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expense. During the period from August 28, 2013 (inception)
to September 30, 2016, the Company recognized no income tax related interest and penalties. The Company had no accruals for income
tax related interest and penalties at September 30, 2016.

Plan of Operations  

The
Company's current business plan is to engage in the mining business developing graphite properties located in Namibia. As previously
reported in the Company s Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the  JVA )
with Micron Investments Pty. Ltd. a private company based in Namibia ( Micron ) on June 8, 2015, which was subsequently
amended on July 10 and July 17, 2015. Pursuant to the JVA, as amended, the Company and Micron entered into a Farm-Out Agreement
on September 12, 2016. The JVA and Farm-Out Agreement require Micron to pay the Company $180,000 in cash by the end of the Farm-Out
period, and to pay $1.1 million to build and operate a graphite processing plant on the Company s Aukam site, and to cover
all related operational costs until 5 months after completion of the plant. The plant construction is expected to take roughly
ten months. In exchange, Micron will receive, upon achievement of certain milestones, up to a 63% interest in the mining and mineral
rights held by the Company at its Aukam site. The Company plans to retain a minimum of 37% interest in the mining and mineral
rights held by the Company at its Aukam site, after having purchased the 10% interest held by the Centre for Geoscience Research
CC pursuant to a purchase agreement with Gazania Investments Two Hundred and Forty Two Ltd., and Centre for Geosciences Research
Close Corporation, dated August 6, 2015. As a result of this acquisition, the Company now has 100% ownership rights to the prospecting
license to the Aukam property.   

As
previously reported in the Company s Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016, in July of 2015 Micron was acquired by CKR Carbon
Corporation, a Canadian based corporation, formerly known as Caribou King Resources, Ltd. ( CKR ).  

The JVA calls for CKR and the Company
to begin processing immediately available surface dumps, which contain large quantities of high-grade graphite lumps, and develop
its three existing adits as well as other locations on the Company s 96,000 acre Aukam site. Favorable laboratory results
were realized in 2015 and engineering and research continue on the adits and are planned to be expanded elsewhere on the property
in 2016. 

The JVA also
calls for the plant to process up to 5,000 tonnes of processed graphite tailings per year. Initial production is anticipated to
commence in the second or third fiscal quarter of 2017. Moreover, as previously reported in the Company s Form 10-K filed
on April 14, 2016, our Joint Venture Partner signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (the  LOI ) in March of 2016 for
us to supply 5,000 tonnes of unrefined graphite from our Aukam site. 

The Company s
near term objectives include working towards fulfilling the orders under the LOI mentioned above. The Company and its JV Partner
also plans to commence the building of the processing plant once the permanent mining license is secured, with preparation for
that currently underway. 

The
Company expects to realize revenues from the sales planned to be made under the LOI in the near future or in 2017. However, there
are no assurances that purchase orders will commence or that construction of the processing plant will be completed on schedule,
if at all. There can also be no assurances that the Company can recognize any revenues under the LOI. There can also be no guaranty
that the Farm-Out agreement with Micron will be consummated, or if it is consummated, that it will be on terms acceptable to the
Company.   

Recent Developments   

As previously reported in the Company s
Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016, in February of 2016, the Company received a Conditional Renewal of its exclusive prospecting
license EPL 3895 from the Namibian Ministry of Mines and Energy. In May of 2016, the Company received Formal Renewal of its exclusive
prospecting license EPL 3895 from the Namibian Ministry of Mines and Energy. The license renewal is set to expire in April of
2017 and application for a permanent mining license is currently underway. 

Additionally, the Company s JV
entered into a definitive agreement with a vertically integrated graphite producer to supply an initial 5,000 tonnes of graphite
per annum, subject to receiving a full mining license, an application for which will be submitted in early 2017. The supply agreement
expands upon the Letter of Intent signed in March. The agreement is for ten (10) years and the Producer has the option to renew
the agreement for an additional ten (10) years. 

Results of Operations  

Operating
expenses were $183,686 and $386,980 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $200,545
and $295,729 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increase
in professional fee. 

Other income (expense) -net, were $10,641 and $44,686
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to other income (expense) -net were ($7,042) and
($71,274) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase in other income (expense) was
due to the fluctuation of fair value of derivative liability. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had $2,738
in cash. 

The Company does not currently have
sufficient resources to cover ongoing expenses and expansion. From August 2013 to September 30, 2016, we consummated various private
placements of our securities, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $1,600,850. We used $240,000 out of the net proceeds to
make a payment to NMC under the Option Agreement in connection with the option grant closing and the option exercise closing.
Under the Option Agreement, we undertook to provide at least $260,000 of working capital to or for the benefit of Gazania from
the option grant closing date to September 30, 2014. We plan on raising additional funds from investors to implement our business
model. In the event we are unsuccessful, this will have a negative impact on our operations. 

If the Company cannot find sources
of additional financing to fund its working capital needs, the Company will be unable to obtain sufficient capital resources to
operate our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access any financing in sufficient amounts or at all when needed.
Our inability to obtain sufficient working capital funding will have an immediate material adverse effect upon our financial condition
and our business. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Development stage entity   

The Company is considered a development
stage entity, as defined in FASB ASC 915, because since inception it has not commenced operations that have resulted in significant
revenue and the Company s efforts have been devoted primarily to activities related to raising capital. 

Going concern   

The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of obligations in the normal course of business. However, it has $2,738 in cash, has losses and an accumulated
deficit, and a working capital deficiency. The Company does not currently have any revenue generating operations.
These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as
a going concern. 

In view of these matters, continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability
to, meets its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that
may be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern. 

Management believes they can raise
the appropriate funds needed to support their business plan and acquire an operating company with positive cash flow. Management
intends to seek new capital from owners and related parties to provide needed funds. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements,
financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as  special purpose entities 
(SPEs). 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are a smaller reporting company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Securities and Exchange Commission
defines the term  disclosure controls and procedures  to mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required
to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated
and communicated to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  

As of the end of the period covered
by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based
on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the material weaknesses disclosed in
the Company s Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016, continue to exist and accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

No change in our system of internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item
1. Legal Proceedings

time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. The Company is not currently party to any legal proceedings or threatened legal proceedings, the adverse outcome
of which, individually or in the aggregate, it believes would have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial
condition and consolidated results of operations.
