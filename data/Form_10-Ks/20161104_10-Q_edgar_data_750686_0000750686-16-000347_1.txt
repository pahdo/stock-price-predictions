NOTE 2 - COMMON STOCK SPLIT 
    
  On August 30, 2016, the Company's board of directors declared a three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, on the Company's common stock. Each shareholder of record on September 15, 2016, received   one   additional share of common stock for every   two   shares of common stock owned. The stock was issued September 30, 2016. All references in the financial statements to the number of shares outstanding, dividends declared and per share amounts of the Company's common stock have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented. 
    
  The Company paid shareholders cash in-lieu of fractional shares of common stock in connection with the split, at a price of   $31.75   per share, the closing price of the Company s common stock on September 14, 2016.  The total cash in-lieu paid out for fractional shares was   $5,000  , and was accounted for as a reduction of capital stock. 

NOTE 3   EPS 
    
  The following is an analysis of basic and diluted EPS, reflecting the application of the two-class method, as described below: 

(1) Represents dividends paid and undistributed earnings allocated to nonvested stock-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. 
  (2) Share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split effective September 30, 2016, for all periods presented. Refer to Note 2. 
  (3) Represents the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted shares, vesting of restricted stock units, and vesting of LTIP awards that have met the performance criteria, as applicable, utilizing the treasury stock method. 
  (4) Represents stock-based awards not included in the computation of potential common shares for purposes of calculating diluted EPS as the exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the Company's common stock and are considered anti-dilutive. 
    
  Nonvested stock-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Certain of the Company s nonvested stock-based awards qualify as participating securities.  
     
  Net income is allocated between the common stock and participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding participating nonvested stock-based awards.  
    
  Diluted EPS is computed in a similar manner, except that the denominator includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive common shares were issued using the treasury stock method.

NOTE 4   SECURITIES 
    
  The following tables summarize the amortized cost and estimated fair values of AFS and HTM securities, as of the dates indicated:  

Net unrealized gains on AFS securities at   September 30, 2016   included in AOCI amounted to   $6.6 million  , net of a deferred tax liability of   $3.6 million  . Net unrealized losses on AFS securities at December 31, 2015 included in AOCI amounted to   $3.8 million  , net of a deferred tax benefit of   $2.0 million  . 
    
  During the first   nine   months of 2016, the Company purchased investment securities totaling   $140.7 million  . The Company designated   $130.3 million   as AFS securities and   $10.4 million   as HTM securities. 
    
  During the first nine months of 2015, the Company purchased investment securities totaling   $136.7 million  . The Company designated   $81.3 million   as AFS securities and   $55.4 million   as HTM securities.  

11 

Impaired Securities 
  Management periodically reviews the Company s investment portfolio to determine the cause, magnitude and duration of declines in the fair value of each security. Thorough evaluations of the causes of the unrealized losses are performed to determine whether the impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary in nature. Considerations such as the ability of the securities to meet cash flow requirements, levels of credit enhancements, risk of curtailment, and recoverability of invested amount over a reasonable period of time, and the length of time the security is in a loss position, for example, are applied in determining OTTI. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the security is permanently reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized. 
    
  The following table presents the estimated fair values and gross unrealized losses of investment securities that were in a continuous loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by length of time that individual securities in each category have been in a continuous loss position:   

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   32   and   109   investment securities with a fair value of   $149.4 million   and   $546.0 million   with unrealized losses totaling $  1.1 million   and   $10.2 million  , respectively, that were considered temporary. Of these, the Company had   30   MBS and CMO investments with a fair value of $  111.3 million   that were in an unrealized loss position totaling   $966,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   28   MBS and CMO investments with a fair value of   $192.8 million   that were in an unrealized loss position totaling   $6.7 million   at December 31, 2015 for 12 months or more. The unrealized loss was reflective of current interest rates in excess of the yield received on investments and is not indicative of an overall change in credit quality or other factors with the Company's investment portfolio. At   September 30, 2016   and  
  
   12 

December 31, 2015  , gross unrealized losses on the Company's AFS and HTM securities were   1%   and   2%  , respectively, of the respective investment securities fair value. 
    
  The Company has the intent and ability to retain its investment securities in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   until the decline in value has recovered. 
    
  Sale of Securities 
  The following table details the Company s sales of AFS securities for the period indicated below: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did   no  t sell any securities.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold certain AFS securities with total carrying value of   $12.4 million   and recorded net gains on the sale of AFS securities of   $4,000   within non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. As part of the Company s securities portfolio restructuring due to its pending merger with SBM as of September 30, 2015 (which subsequently was completed on October 16, 2015) it sold all of its Non-Agency guaranteed CMO investments in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, along with   $7.3 million   of MBS investments experiencing high prepayment speeds. The Company recorded a net gain of   $4,000   from the sale of its Non-Agency guaranteed CMO and MBS investments. The Company had previously recorded OTTI on its Non-Agency guaranteed CMO investments of   $204,000  . 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold certain AFS securities with a total carrying value of   $84,000   and recorded net gains on the sale of AFS securities of   $4,000   within non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. The Company had not previously recorded any OTTI on these securities sold.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold certain AFS securities with total carrying value of   $12.4 million   and recorded net gains on sale of AFS securities of   $4,000   within non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. 
     
  The cost basis of securities sold is measured on a specific identification basis. 
    
  FHLBB and FRB Stock 
   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's investment in FHLBB stock was   $17.8 million   and   $20.6 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's investment in FRB stock was   $5.4 million   and $  908,000  , respectively.  
    
  Securities Pledged 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , securities with an amortized cost of   $594.9 million   and   $577.6 million   and estimated fair values of   $602.2 million   and   $570.9 million  , respectively, were pledged to secure FHLBB advances, public deposits, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 

13 

Contractual Maturities 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair values of debt securities by contractual maturity at   September 30, 2016  , are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

NOTE 5   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
    
  The composition of the Company s loan portfolio, excluding residential loans held for sale, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows:    

(1) The loan balances are presented net of the unamortized fair value mark discount associated with the purchase accounting for acquired loans of   $9.6 million   and   $13.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Bank s lending activities are primarily conducted in Maine, and its footprint continues to expand into other New England states, including New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The Company originates single family and multi-family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, business loans, municipal loans and a variety of consumer loans. In addition, the Company makes loans for the construction of residential homes, multi-family properties and commercial real estate properties. The ability and willingness of borrowers to honor their repayment commitments is generally dependent on the level of overall economic activity within the geographic area and the general economy. 
    
  The HPFC loan portfolio consists of niche commercial lending to the small business medical field, including dentists, optometrists and veterinarians across the U.S. The ability and willingness of borrowers to honor their repayment commitments is generally dependent on the success of the borrower's business. Unlike the Bank's loan portfolio, there is, generally, little to no indication of credit quality issues and/or concerns of borrowers honoring their commitments until a payment is delinquent. Generally, once a payment is delinquent, if the payment is not received shortly thereafter to bring the loan current, the loan is deemed impaired (typically within   45   days). Effective February 19, 2016, the Company closed HPFC's operations and is no longer originating loans.  
    
  The ALL is management s best estimate of the inherent risk of loss in the Company s loan portfolio as of the consolidated statement of condition date. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors including historical losses. If those assumptions are incorrect, the ALL may not be sufficient to cover losses and may cause an increase in the allowance in the future. Among the factors that could affect the Company s ability to collect loans and require an increase to the allowance in the future are: (i) financial condition of borrowers; (ii) real estate market changes; (iii) state, regional, and national economic conditions; and (iv) a requirement by federal and state regulators to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize additional charge-offs. 
    
  There were no significant changes in the Company's ALL methodology during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Board of Directors monitors credit risk through the Directors' Loan Review Committee, which reviews large credit exposures, monitors the external loan review reports, reviews the lending authority for individual loan officers when required, and has approval authority and responsibility for all matters regarding the loan policy and other credit-related policies, including reviewing and monitoring asset quality trends, concentration levels, and the ALL methodology. The Credit Risk Administration and the Credit Risk Policy Committee oversee the Company's systems and procedures to monitor the credit quality of its loan portfolio, conduct a loan review program, maintain the integrity of the loan rating system, determine the adequacy of the ALL and support the oversight efforts of the Directors' Loan Review Committee and the Board of Directors. The Company's practice is to proactively manage the portfolio such that management can identify problem credits early, assess and implement effective work-out strategies, and take charge-offs as promptly as practical. In addition, the Company continuously reassesses its underwriting standards in response to credit risk posed by changes in economic conditions. For  
  
   15 

purposes of determining the ALL, the Company disaggregates its loans into portfolio segments, which include residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial, home equity, consumer and HPFC. Each portfolio segment possesses unique risk characteristics that are considered when determining the appropriate level of allowance. These risk characteristics unique to each portfolio segment include: 
    
  Residential Real Estate  .   Residential real estate loans held in the Company's loan portfolio are made to borrowers who demonstrate the ability to make scheduled payments with full consideration to underwriting factors. Borrower qualifications include favorable credit history combined with supportive income requirements and combined loan-to-value ratios within established policy guidelines. Collateral consists of mortgage liens on one- to four-family residential properties. 
    
  Commercial Real Estate.   Commercial real estate loans consist of mortgage loans to finance investments in real property such as multi-family residential, commercial/retail, office, industrial, hotels, educational, health care facilities and other specific use properties. Commercial real estate loans are typically written with amortizing payment structures. Collateral values are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations in accordance with established policy guidelines. Loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy and regulatory guidelines. Commercial real estate loans are primarily paid by the cash flow generated from the real property, such as operating leases, rents, or other operating cash flows from the borrower. 
    
  Commercial.   Commercial loans consist of revolving and term loan obligations extended to business and corporate enterprises for the purpose of financing working capital and/or capital investment. Collateral generally consists of pledges of business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, plant   equipment, or real estate, if applicable. Commercial loans are primarily paid by the operating cash flow of the borrower. Commercial loans may be secured or unsecured. 
    
  Home Equity.   Home equity loans and lines are made to qualified individuals for legitimate purposes secured by senior or junior mortgage liens on owner-occupied one- to four-family homes, condominiums, or vacation homes. The home equity loan has a fixed rate and is billed as equal payments comprised of principal and interest. The home equity line of credit has a variable rate and is billed as interest-only payments during the draw period. At the end of the draw period, the home equity line of credit is billed as a percentage of the principal balance plus all accrued interest. Borrower qualifications include favorable credit history combined with supportive income requirements and combined loan-to-value ratios within established policy guidelines. 
    
  Consumer.   Consumer loan products including personal lines of credit and amortizing loans made to qualified individuals for various purposes such as education, auto loans, debt consolidation, personal expenses or overdraft protection. Borrower qualifications include favorable credit history combined with supportive income and collateral requirements within established policy guidelines. Consumer loans may be secured or unsecured. 
    
  HPFC.   HPFC is a niche lender that provides commercial lending to dentists, optometrists and veterinarians, many of which are start-up companies. HPFC's loan portfolio consists of term loan obligations extended for the purpose of financing working capital and/or purchase of equipment. Collateral may consist of pledges of business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, and/or equipment. These loans are primarily paid by the operating cash flow of the borrower and the terms range from   seven   to   ten   years.

The following tables present the activity in the ALL and select loan information by portfolio segment for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  :

    The provision (credit) for loan losses excludes any impact for the change in the reserve for unfunded commitments, which represents management's estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses on outstanding letters of credit and unused lines of credit. The reserve for unfunded commitments is presented within accrued interest and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of condition. At   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and   December 31, 2015  , the reserve for unfunded commitments was   $14,000  ,   $24,000   and   $22,000  , respectively. 
       
  The following table reconciles the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and year ended   December 31, 2015   provision for loan losses to the provision for credit losses as presented on the consolidated statement of income: 

The provision for loan losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $1.0 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was driven by (i) the increase in loans (excluding loans held for sale) of   $761.9 million   since   September 30, 2015  , of which   $615.4 million   the Company acquired as part of the SBM acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as (ii) the deterioration of   one   commercial real estate and   one   commercial credit in the second quarter of 2016 accounting for   $2.3 million   of the provision for loan losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company placed the commercial real estate loan on non-accrual status in the second quarter of 2016, and the commercial loan was previously on non-accrual status.  The recorded investment balance of the commercial real estate loan at September 30, 2016 was   $11.3 million   and the recorded investment balance of the commercial loan at September 30, 2016 was   $1.6 million  . The Company believes that the credit deterioration of these   two   credits were driven by specific facts and circumstances of the borrowers and does not represent a systemic issue across its commercial real estate or commercial loan portfolios. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company partially charged-off   $1.4 million   of the aforementioned commercial loan, which was previously reserved for in the second quarter of 2016. 

18 

The Company focuses on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified loan portfolio. Despite such efforts, it is recognized that credit concentrations may occasionally emerge as a result of economic conditions, changes in local demand, natural loan growth and runoff. To ensure that credit concentrations can be effectively identified, all commercial and commercial real estate loans are assigned Standard Industrial Classification codes, North American Industry Classification System codes, and state and county codes. Shifts in portfolio concentrations are monitored by Credit Risk Administration. As of   September 30, 2016  , the non-residential building operators industry exposure was   13%   of the Company's total loan portfolio and   33%   of the total commercial real estate portfolio. There were   no   other industry exposures exceeding   10%   of the Company's total loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  To further identify loans with similar risk profiles, the Company categorizes each portfolio segment into classes by credit risk characteristic and applies a credit quality indicator to each portfolio segment. The indicators for commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and HPFC loans are represented by Grades 1 through 10 as outlined below. In general, risk ratings are adjusted periodically throughout the year as updated analysis and review warrants. This process may include, but is not limited to, annual credit and loan reviews, periodic reviews of loan performance metrics, such as delinquency rates, and quarterly reviews of adversely risk rated loans. The Company uses the following definitions when assessing grades for the purpose of evaluating the risk and adequacy of the ALL: 

Grade 1 through 6   Grades 1 through 6 represent groups of loans that are not subject to adverse criticism as defined in regulatory guidance. Loans in these groups exhibit characteristics that represent low to moderate risks, which is measured using a variety of credit risk criteria, such as cash flow coverage, debt service coverage, balance sheet leverage, liquidity, management experience, industry position, prevailing economic conditions, support from secondary sources of repayment and other credit factors that may be relevant to a specific loan. In general, these loans are supported by properly margined collateral and guarantees of principal parties. 
                
    Grade 7   Loans with potential weakness (Special Mention). Loans in this category are currently protected based on collateral and repayment capacity and do not constitute undesirable credit risk, but have potential weakness that may result in deterioration of the repayment process at some future date. This classification is used if a negative trend is evident in the obligor s financial situation. Special mention loans do not sufficiently expose the Company to warrant adverse classification. 
                
    Grade 8   Loans with definite weakness (Substandard). Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by collateral pledged. Borrowers experience difficulty in meeting debt repayment requirements. Deterioration is sufficient to cause the Company to look to the sale of collateral. 
                
    Grade 9   Loans with potential loss (Doubtful). Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in the substandard grade with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation of the loan in full highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of some loss is extremely high, but because of specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. 
                
    Grade 10   Loans with definite loss (Loss). Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible. The loss classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the asset because recovery and collection time may be protracted. 
       
  Asset quality indicators are periodically reassessed to appropriately reflect the risk composition of the Company s loan portfolio. Home equity and consumer loans are not individually risk rated, but rather analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency rates and other economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to meet debt service requirements, including interest rates and energy costs. Performing loans include loans that are current and loans that are past due less than 90 days. Loans that are past due over 90 days and non-accrual loans, including TDRs, are considered non-performing. 

19 

The following table summarizes credit risk exposure indicators by portfolio segment as of the following dates: 

The Company closely monitors the performance of its loan portfolio for both the Bank and HPFC. A loan is placed on non-accrual status when the financial condition of the borrower is deteriorating, payment in full of both principal and interest is not expected as scheduled or principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more. Exceptions may be made if the asset is well-secured by collateral sufficient to satisfy both the principal and accrued interest in full and collection is reasonably assured. When one loan to a borrower is placed on non-accrual status, all other loans to the borrower are re-evaluated to determine if they should also be placed on non-accrual status. All previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at this time. A loan may return to accrual status when collection of principal and interest is assured and the borrower has demonstrated timely payments of principal and interest for a reasonable period. Unsecured loans, however, are not normally placed on non-accrual status because they are charged-off once their collectability is in doubt. 
    
  The following is a loan aging analysis by portfolio segment (including loans past due over 90 days and non-accrual loans) and a summary of non-accrual loans, which include TDRs, and loans past due over 90 days and accruing as of the following dates: 

20 

Interest income that would have been recognized if loans on non-accrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms was   $251,000  ,   $675,000  ,   $103,000   and   $375,000   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  TDRs: 
  The Company takes a conservative approach with credit risk management and remains focused on community lending and reinvesting. The Company works closely with borrowers experiencing credit problems to assist in loan repayment or term modifications. TDR loans consist of loans where the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, granted a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs, typically, involve term modifications or a reduction of either interest or principal. Once such an obligation has been restructured, it will remain a TDR until paid in full, or until the loan is again restructured at current market rates and no concessions are granted. 
    
  The specific reserve allowance was determined by discounting the total expected future cash flows from the borrower at the original loan interest rate, or if the loan is currently collateral-dependent, using the NRV, which was obtained through independent appraisals and internal evaluations. The following is a summary of TDRs, by portfolio segment, and the associated specific reserve included within the ALL as of the periods indicated: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had performing and non-performing TDRs with a recorded investment balance of   $4.4 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively. At December 31, 2015, the Company had performing and non-performing TDRs with a recorded investment balance of   $4.8 million   and   $446,000  , respectively.   
    
  The following represents loan modifications that occurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 that qualify as TDRs and the type of loan modification made by portfolio segment at September 30: 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed the restructure of   one   commercial relationship, which resulted in   six   TDRs. As part of the restructure the Company committed to lend additional funds of up to   $280,000  . The Company did   no  t have any other commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers with loans classified as TDRs as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015,   no   loans were modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months for which the borrower subsequently defaulted.  
  
   21 

Impaired Loans: 
  Impaired loans consist of non-accrual and TDR loans that are individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with the Company's policy. The following is a summary of impaired loan balances and the associated allowance by portfolio segment as of and for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2015: 

22 

The impaired loan information presented for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and year ended   December 31, 2015   was revised to disclose only those impaired loans that are individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with the Company's policy, which includes (i) loans with a principal balance greater than   $250,000   or more and are classified as substandard or doubtful and are on non-accrual status and (ii) all TDRs. Previously, the Company's impaired loan disclosures included certain non-accrual loans which were collectively evaluated under ASC 450-20. The revision of prior period information had no impact on the Company's ALL, provision for loan losses, or its asset quality ratios as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Loan Sales: 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company sold   $71.4 million  ,   $166.6 million  ,   $11.9 million   and   $24.5 million  , respectively, of fixed rate residential mortgage loans on the secondary market that resulted in gains on the sale of loans (net of costs) of   $2.0 million  ,   $4.2 million  ,   $243,000   and   $530,000  , respectively.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had certain residential mortgage loans with a principal balance of   $24.4 million   and   $10.8 million  , respectively, designated as held for sale. The Company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its loans held for sale and for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded within non-interest income on its consolidated statements of income the net change in unrealized gains (losses) of   $(55,000)  ,   $99,000  ,   $(15,000)   and   $4,000  , respectively. 
    
  OREO: 
  The Company records its properties obtained through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure as OREO properties on the consolidated statements of condition at NRV.   At September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   residential and   three   commercial real estate properties with a carrying value of   $75,000   and   $736,000  , respectively, within OREO. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   two   residential real estate properties and   seven   commercial properties with a carrying value of   $241,000   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, within OREO.  
  
   23 

In-Process Foreclosure Proceedings: 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $1.5 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which foreclosure proceedings were in process, representing   27%   and   32%  , respectively, of non-accrual loans within the Company's residential, consumer and home equity portfolios. The Company continues to be focused on working these consumer mortgage loans through the foreclosure process to resolution; however, the foreclosure process, typically, will take   18   to   24   months due to the State of Maine foreclosure laws. 
    
  FHLB Advances: 
    
  FHLB advances are those borrowings from the FHLBB greater than 90 days. FHLB advances are collateralized by a blanket lien on qualified collateral consisting primarily of loans with first mortgages secured by one- to four-family properties, certain commercial real estate loans, certain pledged investment securities and other qualified assets. The carrying value of residential real estate and commercial loans pledged as collateral was   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Refer to Notes 4 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of securities pledged as collateral. 

NOTE 6   SBM ACQUISITION 
    
  On October 16, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of SBM, as previously reported. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made certain measurement-period adjustments to its initial purchase accounting that decreased goodwill reported at December 31, 2015 by   $960,000  . These measurement-period adjustments increased the previously reported loan balance by   $137,000  , increased acquired interest receivable and other assets by   $157,000  , and increased acquired deferred tax assets   $666,000  . The measurement-period adjustments will   no  t have a material effect on current or future years' net income and were presented and disclosed prospectively in accordance with ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  . 
  
   24

The following table reflects the expected amortization schedule for intangible assets over the period of estimated economic benefit (assuming no additional intangible assets are created or impaired): 

26 

NOTE 8   REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital based on risk-adjusted assets. These capital requirements represent quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company and the Bank's capital classification is also subject to qualitative judgments by our regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, Tier I capital, and common equity Tier I to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average assets, or leverage ratio. These guidelines apply to the Company on a consolidated basis. 
    
  Under the current guidelines, banking organizations must have a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of   8.0%  , a minimum Tier I risk-based capital ratio of   6.0%  , a minimum common equity Tier I risk-based capital ratio of   4.5%  , and a minimum leverage ratio of   4.0%   in order to be "adequately capitalized." In addition to these requirements, banking organizations must maintain a   2.5%   capital conservation buffer consisting of common Tier I equity, subject to a transition schedule with a full phase-in by 2019. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company and the Bank were required to establish a capital conservation buffer of   0.625%  , increasing the minimum required total risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based and common equity Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets they must maintain to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. 
    
  The Company and the Bank's risk-based capital ratios exceeded regulatory guidelines at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The following table presents the Company and Bank's regulatory capital ratios at the periods indicated: 

In addition, the OCC requires a minimum level of   $2.5 million   of Tier I capital to be maintained at Acadia Trust. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Acadia Trust met all of its capital requirements. 
    
  On October 8, 2015, the Company issued   $15.0 million   of   10   year subordinated debentures bearing interest at an annual rate of   5.50%  . In addition,   $43.0 million   of junior subordinated debentures were issued in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities in 2006 and 2008. Although the subordinated debentures and the junior subordinated debentures are recorded as liabilities on the Company's consolidated statements of condition, the Company is permitted, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, to include, subject to certain limits, each within its calculation of risk-based capital. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $15.0 million   of subordinated debentures were included as Tier II capital and were included in the calculation of the Company's total risk-based capital, and, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $43.0 million   of the junior subordinated debentures were included in Tier I and total risk-based capital for the Company.  
  
   27 

NOTE 9   INCOME TAXES 
    
  The Company's effective income tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows:   

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following discrete period items impacting its effective tax rate: 
             
    In the second quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 was adopted effective as of January 1, 2016. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company accounted for its windfall tax benefits or shortfalls generated upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option or a disqualifying incentive stock option, or upon vesting of its restricted shares through shareholders' equity (or as income tax expense to the extent the Company did not have a windfall tax benefit surplus). Upon adoption, the Company has accounted for its windfall tax benefits and shortfalls generated within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income as a discrete period item in the quarter generated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net windfall tax benefits of   $63,000   and   $427,000  , respectively, reducing the Company's effective tax rate and increasing net income for the respective periods. 
                
    In the second quarter of 2016, the Company received death benefits from its BOLI policy from one of its insureds totaling   $578,000  , of which   $394,000   was recognized as income on the consolidated statements of income within bank-owned life insurance. The income recognized was non-taxable reducing the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
       
  In conjunction with the SBM acquisition, the Company incurred   $537,000   of equity issuance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the registration of additional shares of the Company's common stock. These costs were non-deductible for tax purposes and increased the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company did   no  t incur any equity issuance costs for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

NOTE 10   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The Company sponsors unfunded, non-qualified SERPs for certain officers and provides medical and life insurance to certain eligible retired employees. The components of net period benefit cost for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 
  Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: 

(1) Presented within the consolidated statements of income within salaries and employee benefits. 

28 

Other Postretirement Benefit Plan:   

  (1) Presented within the consolidated statements of income within salaries and employee benefits. 

NOTE 11   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS    
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company granted share-based awards, subject to certain terms and conditions, to certain officers, executive officers, and directors of the Company, Bank and Acadia Trust. All share-based awards granted were issued under the 2012 Plan. The following outlines the details, and terms and conditions of the material awards granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective as of September 30, 2016: 
             
    8,688   restricted stock awards were granted to executive officers under the 2016-2018 LTIP, at a fair value of   $28.87   per share, based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on January 4, 2016. The restricted stock awards vest pro-rata over a   three   year period. The holders of the restricted stock awards participate fully in the rewards of stock ownership of the Company, including voting and dividend rights. 
                
    10,734   restricted stock awards and restricted stock units were granted at a fair value of   $27.20   per share, based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the March 17, 2016 grant date. The restricted stock awards vest pro-rata over a   five  -year period, while the restricted stock units vest pro-rata over a   three  -year period subject to the achievement of certain performance measures. The holders of the restricted stock awards participate fully in the rewards of stock ownership of the Company, including voting and dividend rights. 
                 
    4,094   deferred stock awards were issued to certain executive officers under the DCRP. Of the   4,094   awards granted,   1,741   vested immediately on the grant date, the remainder will vest pro-rata until the recipient reaches age   65  . The stock awards have been determined to have a fair value of   $27.03   per unit, based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the March 15, 2016 grant date. 

7,308   unrestricted stock awards were issued to the directors of the Company and the Bank under the Independent Directors' Equity Compensation Program. The unrestricted stock awards fully vested immediately on the May 1, 2016 grant date. The fair value of the share awards issued was determined using the closing price of the Company's stock on April 29, 2016 of   $29.01   per share.

NOTE 12   BORROWINGS 
    
  The following table summarizes other borrowed funds as presented on the consolidated statements of condition at: 

NOTE 13   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 
    
  The Company can raise additional liquidity by entering into repurchase agreements at its discretion. In a security repurchase agreement transaction, the Company will generally sell a security, agreeing to repurchase either the same or substantially identical security on a specified later date, at a greater price than the original sales price. The difference between the sale price and purchase price is the cost of the proceeds, which is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statement of income. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to counterparties as security for the repurchase obligations. Since the securities are treated as collateral and the agreement does not qualify for a full transfer of effective control, the transactions does not meet the criteria to be classified as a sale, and is therefore considered a secured borrowing transaction for accounting purposes. Payments on such borrowings are interest only until the scheduled repurchase date. In a repurchase agreement, the Company is subject to the risk that the purchaser may default at maturity and not return the securities underlying the agreements. In order to minimize this potential risk, the Company either deals with established firms when entering into these transactions or with customers whose agreements stipulate that the securities underlying the agreement are not delivered to the customer and instead are held in segregated safekeeping accounts by the Company's safekeeping agents.  

30 

The table below sets forth information regarding the Company s repurchase agreements accounted for as secured borrowings and types of collateral as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Certain customers held CDs totaling   $916,000   and   $914,000   with the Bank at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, that were collateralized by CMO and MBS securities that were overnight repurchase agreements.  
    
  Certain counterparties monitor collateral, and may request additional collateral to be posted from time to time.

NOTE 14   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE 
    
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined using quoted market prices. However, in many instances, quoted market prices are not available. In such instances, fair values are determined using various valuation techniques. Various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. 
    
  GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and other items at fair value. The Company has elected the fair value option for its loans held for sale. Electing the fair value option for loans held for sale enables the Company s financial position to more clearly align with the economic value of the actively traded asset. 
    
  The fair value hierarchy for valuation of an asset or liability is as follows: 
    
  Level 1:     Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2:     Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, from quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market. 
    
  Level 3:     Valuation is derived from model-based and other techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and which may be based on the Company s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability. 
    
  In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon model-based techniques incorporating various assumptions including interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses. Assets and liabilities valued using model-based techniques are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, depending on the lowest level classification of an input that is considered significant to the overall valuation. A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. 
    
  Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Loans Held For Sale:   The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted secondary market prices or executed sales agreements and is classified as Level 2. 
    
  AFS Securities  :  The fair value of debt AFS securities is reported utilizing prices provided by an independent pricing service based on recent trading activity and other observable information including, but not limited to, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, market interest rate curves, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the bond s terms and conditions. The fair value of debt securities are classified as Level 2. 
    
  The fair value of equity AFS securities is reported utilizing market prices based on recent trading activity. The equity securities are traded on inactive markets and are classified as Level 2. 
    
  Derivatives  :  The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using inputs that are observable in the market place obtained from third parties including yield curves, publicly available volatilities, and floating indexes and, accordingly, are classified as Level 2 inputs. The credit value adjustments associated with derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives due to collateral postings. 
    
  The fair value of interest rate lock commitments is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 

32 

The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value: 

The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company s policy for determining transfers between levels occurs at the end of the reporting period when circumstances in the underlying valuation criteria change and result in transfer between levels. 
  
   33 

Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis    
  The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market value that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. 
    
  Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans  :  Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. The Company's policy is to individually evaluate for impairment loans with a principal balance greater than   $250,000   or more and are classified as substandard or doubtful and are on non-accrual status. Once the population of loans is identified for individual impairment assessment, the Company measures these loans for impairment by comparing NRV, which is the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, to the carrying value of the loan. If the NRV of the loan is less than the carrying value of the loan, then a loss is recognized as part of the ALL to adjust the loan's carrying value to NRV. Accordingly, certain collateral-dependent impaired loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Management has estimated the fair values of these assets using Level 2 inputs, such as the fair value of collateral based on independent third-party market approach appraisals for collateral-dependent loans, and Level 3 inputs where circumstances warrant an adjustment to the appraised value based on the age of the appraisal and/or comparable sales, condition of the collateral, and market conditions. 
    
  MSRs  :  The Company accounts for mortgage servicing assets at cost, subject to impairment testing. When the carrying value of a tranche exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying cost to fair value. Fair value is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income. The Company obtains a third-party valuation based upon loan level data including note rate, type and term of the underlying loans. The model utilizes a variety of observable inputs for its assumptions, the most significant of which are loan prepayment assumptions and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. Other assumptions include delinquency rates, servicing cost inflation and annual unit loan cost. MSRs are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Non-Financial Assets and Non-Financial Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  The Company has no non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis consist of OREO and goodwill and other intangible assets.  
    
  OREO  :      OREO properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at NRV, which is the fair value of the real estate, less estimated costs to sell. Any write-down of the recorded investment in the related loan is charged to the ALL upon transfer to OREO. Upon acquisition of a property, a current appraisal is used or an internal valuation is prepared to substantiate fair value of the property. After foreclosure, management periodically, but at least annually, obtains updated valuations of the OREO properties and, if additional impairments are deemed necessary, the subsequent write-downs for declines in value are recorded through a valuation allowance and a provision for losses charged to other non-interest expense within the consolidated statements of income. As management considers appropriate, adjustments are made to the appraisal obtained for the OREO property to account for recent sales activity of comparable properties, changes in the condition of the property, and changes in market conditions. These adjustments are not observable in an active market and are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  :  Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The fair value of goodwill is estimated by utilizing several standard valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses, bank merger multiples, and/or an estimation of the impact of business conditions and investor activities on the long-term value of the goodwill. Should an impairment of either reporting unit's goodwill occur, the associated goodwill is written-down to fair value and the impairment charge is recorded within non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. The Company conducts an annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently as necessary. There have been no indications or triggering events during for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for which management believes that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. 
    
  The Company's core deposit intangible assets represent the estimated value of acquired customer relationships and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of those relationships. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If necessary, management will test the core deposit intangibles for impairment by comparing its carrying value to the expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets. If the undiscounted cash flows of the intangible assets exceed its carrying value then the intangible assets are deemed to be fully recoverable and not impaired. However, if the undiscounted cash flows of the intangible assets are less than its carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded to mark the carrying value of the intangible assets to fair value. There were no events or changes in circumstances for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that indicated the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

GAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair values of its other financial instruments. 
    
  Cash and Due from Banks  :  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of condition approximate fair value. 
    
  HTM securities  :  The fair value is estimated utilizing prices provided by an independent pricing service based on recent trading activity and other observable information including, but not limited to, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, market interest rate curves, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the bond s terms and conditions. The fair value is classified as Level 2. 
    
  Loans  :  For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair value of other loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. 
    
  Interest Receivable and Payable  :  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of condition approximate fair value. 
    
  Deposits  :  The fair value of demand, interest checking, savings and money market deposits is determined as the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using market rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  Borrowings  :  The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings from the FHLB, securities sold under repurchase agreements, notes payable and other short-term borrowings approximate fair value. The fair values of long-term borrowings and commercial repurchase agreements are based on the discounted cash flows using current rates for advances of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  Subordinated Debentures  :  The fair values of are based on quoted prices from similar instruments in inactive markets. 
  
   36 

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair value for financial instrument assets and liabilities measured at   September 30, 2016  :  

(1) 
    The presented carrying amount is net of the allocated ALL. 
              (2)

NOTE 15   COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES     AND DERIVATIVES 
    
  Legal Contingencies  
  In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to pending and threatened legal actions. Although the Company is not able to predict the outcome of such actions, after reviewing pending and threatened actions with counsel, management believes that based on the information currently available the outcome of such actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position as a whole. 
    
  Reserves are established for legal claims only when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many lawsuits and arbitrations, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the case is close to resolution, in which case a reserve will not be recognized until that time. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did   no  t have any material loss contingencies for which accruals were provided for and/or disclosure was deemed necessary. 

38 

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company, as claimant, received legal proceeds from the settlement of a legal matter of   $638,000  . The proceeds have been recorded within other income on the Company's consolidated statements of income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments involving, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in addition to the amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of condition. 
    
  The following is a summary of the contractual and notional amounts of the Company s financial instruments: 

Lending-Related Instruments 
  The contractual amounts of the Company s lending-related financial instruments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since certain of these instruments may expire without being funded and others may not be fully drawn upon. These instruments are subject to the Company s credit approval process, including an evaluation of the customer s creditworthiness and related collateral requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes (primarily interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. The Company controls the credit risk of these instruments through collateral, credit approvals and monitoring procedures. Additionally, as part of Company's normal mortgage origination process, it provides the borrower with the option to lock their interest rate based on current market prices. During the period from commitment date to the loan closing date, the Company is subject to the risk of interest rate change. In an effort to mitigate such risk the Company may enter into forward delivery sales commitments, typically on a "best-efforts" basis, with certain approved investors. 
    
  Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company s financial statements. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not it qualifies and has been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes, and further, by the type of hedging relationship. 
    
  The Company has designated its interest rate swaps on its junior subordinated debentures and its interest rate swaps on forecasted 30-day FHLBB borrowings as cash flow hedges. The change in the fair value of the Company's cash flow hedges is accounted for within OCI, net of tax. Quarterly, in conjunction with financial reporting, the Company assesses each cash flow hedge for ineffectiveness. To the extent any significant ineffectiveness is identified, this amount is recorded within the consolidated statements of income. Furthermore, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the effective portion of the cash flow hedge from OCI into interest within the consolidated statements of income in the period the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
  
   39 

The change in fair value of the Company's other derivative instruments, not designated and qualifying as hedges, are accounted for within the consolidated statements of income. 
     
  Junior Subordinated Debt Interest Rate Swaps: 
  The Company, from time to time, will enter into an interest rate swap agreement with a counterparty to manage interest rate risk associated with its variable rate borrowings. The Company s interest rate swap arrangements contain provisions that require the Company to post cash collateral with the counterparty for contracts that are in a net liability position based on their fair values and the Company s credit rating. If the interest rate swaps are in a net asset position based on their fair value, the counterparty is required to post collateral to the Company. The collateral posted by the Company (or counterparty) is not readily available and has been presented within cash and due from banks on the consolidated statements of condition. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a notional amount of   $43.0 million   in variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreements on its junior subordinated debentures and   $13.5 million   of cash as collateral to the counterparty at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The details of the interest rate swap agreements are as follows:  

For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or 2015, the Company did   no  t record any ineffectiveness on these cash flow hedges within the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Net payments to the counterparty for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $1.2 million   and   $1.3 million   and have been classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  

40 

FHLBB Advance Interest Rate Swaps: 
  The Bank has   two   interest rate swap arrangements with a counterparty on   two   tranches of 30-day FHLBB advances with a total notional amount of   $50.0 million  . Each derivative arrangement commenced on February 25, 2016, with   one   contract set to expire on February 25, 2018 and the other on February 25, 2019. The Bank entered into these interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate exposure on borrowings in a rising interest rate environment. The Bank has designated each arrangement as a cash flow hedge in accordance with GAAP, and, therefore, the change in unrealized gains or losses on the derivative instruments is recorded within AOCI, net of tax. Also, quarterly, in conjunction with financial reporting, the Company assesses each derivative instrument for ineffectiveness. To the extent any significant ineffectiveness is identified this amount would be recorded within the consolidated statements of income. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company did   no  t record any ineffectiveness within the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The Bank's arrangement with the counterparty requires it to post cash collateral for contracts in a net liability position based on their fair values and the Bank's credit rating. If the interest rate swaps are in a net asset position based on their fair value, the counterparty is required to post collateral to the Company. The collateral posted by the Company (or counterparty) is not readily available and is presented within cash and due from banks on the consolidated statements of condition. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank posted cash collateral to the counterparty of   $898,000  . 
    
  The details of the interest rate swap agreements are as follows: 

Net payments to the counterparty for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $351,000   and have been classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
    
  Customer Loan Swaps: 
  The Company will enter into interest rate swaps with its commercial customers, from time to time, to provide them with a means to lock into a long-term fixed rate, while simultaneously the Company enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to swap the fixed rate to a variable rate to allow it to effectively manage its interest rate exposure. 
    
  The Company's customer loan level derivative program is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. As the interest rate swap agreements have substantially equivalent and offsetting terms, they do not materially change the Company s interest rate risk or present any material exposure to the Company's consolidated statements of income. The Company records its customer loan swaps at fair value and presents such on a gross basis within other assets and accrued interest and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of condition. 

41 

The following table presents the total positions, notional and fair value of the Company's customer loans swaps with its commercial customers and the corresponding interest rate swap agreements with counterparty for the periods indicated:  

The Company seeks to mitigate its customer counterparty credit risk exposure through its loan policy and underwriting process, which includes credit approval limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. The Company seeks to mitigate its institutional counterparty credit risk exposure by limiting the institutions for which it will enter into interest swap arrangements through an approved listing by the Company's board of directors. The Company's arrangement with an institutional counterparty requires it to post collateral for contracts in a net liability position based on their fair values and the Bank's credit rating or receive collateral for contracts in a net asset position. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company posted cash collateral with the counterparty of   $15.1 million  . The collateral posted by the Company (or counterparty) is not readily available and is presented within cash and due from banks on the consolidated statements of condition. 
    
  Interest Rate Locks Commitments: 
  As part of originating residential and commercial loans, the Company may enter into rate lock agreements with customers and may issue commitment letters to customers, which are considered interest rate lock commitments. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our pipeline of mortgage loans with interest rate lock commitments were as follows:  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the unrealized gains from the change in fair value on the Company's mortgage interest rate locks reported within mortgage banking income, net, on the consolidated statements of income were   $226,000   and   $14,000  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, the unrealized gains from the change in fair value on the Company's mortgage interest rate locks were   $610,000   and   $33,000  , respectively. 
    
  The table below presents the effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in OCI and current earnings for the periods indicated:   

The Company expects approximately   $1.9 million   (pre-tax) to be reclassified to interest expense from OCI, related to the Company s cash flow hedges, in the next twelve months. This reclassification is due to anticipated payments that will be made and/or received on the swaps based upon the forward curve as of   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 16   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, S  tatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash     Receipts and Cash Payments   (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The ASU was issued to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company does not expect the ASU to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , issued by the FASB in March 2016  .   The Company applied the provisions of the ASU effective as of January 1, 2016, and, as such, previously reported balances on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were updated to account for the ASU adoption as follows: 

(1) Period presented adjusted for three-for-two stock split on September 30, 2016. Refer to Note 2. 
    
  Two   of the more significant provisions of the ASU that impacted the Company's consolidated financial statements were (i) the accounting for windfall tax benefits or shortfalls within income tax expense as a discrete period item in the quarter the event occurred and (ii) a policy election to not estimate the forfeiture rate on unvested share-based compensation awards. As a result of the ASU adoption in the second quarter of 2016, net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased   $63,000   and   $425,000  , respectively. Basic and diluted EPS both increased $  0.02   per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 upon adoption of the ASU, while for the three months ended September 30, 2016 there was   no   change to basic or diluted EPS. 
    
  In accordance with the ASU, the Company applied the provisions to account for windfall tax benefits or shortfalls within income tax expense on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016. In accordance with the ASU, the Company applied its policy election to not estimate the forfeiture rate on unvested share-based compensation awards on a modified-retrospective basis. The impact of such resulted in a reclassification of   $72,000   from retained earnings to common stock shown as a cumulative effect adjustment on the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity. The other provisions of the ASU did   no  t have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses   (Topic 326):   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The ASU was issued to require timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the ASU; however, anticipates that it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842). The ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities (including operating leases) on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Current lease accounting does not require the inclusion of operating leases in the balance sheet.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (Dollar Amounts in Tables Expressed in Thousands, Except Per Share Data) 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  The discussions set forth below and in the documents we incorporate by reference herein contain certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including certain plans, exceptions, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous risks, assumptions, and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of the words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate,   assume,   plan,   target,  or  goal  or future or conditional verbs such as  will,   may,   might,   should,   could  and other expressions which predict or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Forward-looking statements should not be relied on, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
    
  The following factors, among others, could cause the Company s financial performance to differ materially from the Company s goals, plans, objectives, intentions, expectations and other forward-looking statements: 

weakness in the United States economy in general and the regional and local economies within the New England region and Maine, which could result in a deterioration of credit quality, an increase in the allowance for loan losses or a reduced demand for the Company s credit or fee-based products and services; 
                
    changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; 
                
    inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; 
                
    competitive pressures, including continued industry consolidation and the increased financial services provided by non-banks; 
                
    volatility in the securities markets that could adversely affect the value or credit quality of the Company s assets, impairment of goodwill, the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet the Company s liquidity needs, and could lead to impairment in the value of securities in the Company's investment portfolio; 
                
    changes in information technology that require increased capital spending; 
                
    changes in consumer spending and savings habits; 
                
    changes in tax, banking, securities and insurance laws and regulations; 
                
    changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies as well as the FASB and other accounting standard setters; and 
                
    the ability of the Company to achieve cost savings as a result of the merger or in achieving such cost savings within the projected timeframe. 
       
  You should carefully review all of these factors, and be aware that there may be other factors that could cause differences, including the risk factors listed in Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including this report, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers should carefully review the risk factors described therein and should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. 
    
  These forward-looking statements were based on information, plans and estimates at the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events or other changes, except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported. Actual results could materially differ from our current estimates as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near-term change, including: (i) the allowance for credit losses; (ii) accounting for acquisitions and the subsequent review of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets generated in an acquisition for impairment; (iii) OTTI of investments; (iv) accounting for postretirement plans; and (v) income taxes. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for discussion of the Company's critical accounting policies. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP 
    
  In addition to evaluating our results of operations in accordance with GAAP, management supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures help investors to understand our operating performance and trends and allow for better performance comparisons to other banks. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures remove the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial results, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other financial institutions. 
    
  Efficiency Ratio.    The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required for the Company to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense, excluding merger and acquisition costs (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (assumed 35% tax rate) plus total non-interest income, adjusted for net gain on sale of securities, BOLI death benefits and legal settlement proceeds (the denominator). Certain revenues are excluded from reported non-interest income and certain expenses are excluded from reported non-interest expense to remove the effect of certain transactions as we do not believe these depict our normal run-rate operations. 

Tax Equivalent Net Interest Income  .  Tax-equivalent net interest income is net interest income plus the taxes that would have been paid (assumed 35% tax rate) had tax-exempt securities been taxable. This number attempts to enhance the comparability of the performance of assets that have different tax implications. 

46 

Tangible Book Value Per Share and Tangible Common Equity Ratio  .  Tangible book value per share is the ratio of (i) shareholders  equity less goodwill and other intangibles (the numerator) to (ii) total common shares outstanding at period end (the denominator). We believe this is a meaningful measure as it provides information to assess capital adequacy and is a common measure within our industry. 
    
  The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangibles (the numerator) to (ii) total assets less goodwill and other intangibles (the denominator). This ratio is a measure used within our industry to assess whether or not a company is highly leveraged.  

Return On Average Tangible Equity.    Return on average tangible equity is the ratio of (i) net income, adjusted for tax effected amortization of intangible assets, net of tax (the numerator) to (ii) average shareholders' equity, less average goodwill and other intangible assets (the denominator). We believe this is a meaningful measure of our financial performance as it reflects our return on tangible equity in our business, excluding amortization of intangible assets. The return on average tangible equity is a common measure of operating performance within our industry. 
    
  Core Return On Average Tangible Equity.    Core return on average tangible equity is the ratio of (i) net income, adjusted for (a) tax effected amortization of intangible assets, net of tax and (b) merger and acquisition costs, net of tax (the numerator) to (ii) average shareholders' equity, adjusted for average goodwill and other intangible assets. We believe this is a meaningful measure of our financial performance as it reflects our return on tangible equity in our business, excluding the financial impact of transactions that management does not believe are reflective of its core operating activities and the amortization of intangible assets.   

  (1) Assumed a 35% tax rate. 
  (2) Assumed a 35% tax rate for deductible expenses. 
  
   47 

Core Operating Earnings and Core Diluted EPS.    The following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 to exclude the financial impact of certain transactions for which management does not believe are representative of its core operations. Management utilizes core operating earnings and core diluted EPS to compare and assess financial results period-over-period. 

(1) Assumed a 35% tax rate for deductible expenses. 
    
  Normalized Net Interest Margin.    Normalized net interest margin represents our net interest margin for the three and nine months ended, adjusted to exclude the effects of (a) fair value mark accretion from purchase accounting and (b) the collection of previously charged-off acquired loans (numerator) over average total interest-earning assets (denominator). Management believes this is a meaning financial measure as it excludes the financial impact of certain transactions that we do not believe are representative of our core operations.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we announced two major strategic initiatives, including a three-for-two split of the Company's common stock effective September 30, 2016 and the proposed merger of of Acadia Trust into the Bank and creating Camden National Wealth Management. The proposed merger of Acadia Trust into the Bank will align all of our brands, including our brokerage group, Camden Financial Consultants, to provide a comprehensive offering of banking, wealth management and brokerage products and services. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect that the merger of Acadia Trust into the Bank will occur in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Net income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was $10.9 million and $29.2 million, respectively, compared to $6.5 million and $19.3 million for the same periods last year. Diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.70 per share and $1.88 per share, respectively, representing an increase of 23% and 10% compared to the same periods last year. Our strong performance reflects the growth from our traditional markets and those acquired through our merger in October 2015, as well as our continued focus on operating efficiencies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our return on average assets increased 11 basis points to 1.02% and our return on average shareholders' equity increased 10 basis points to 10.29% compared to the same period last year. 
    
  Loan growth (excluding loans held for sale) of $101.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 5% annualized, was driven by our commercial loan portfolio, which increased $141.5 million since year-end. The growth within our commercial loan portfolio was centered in commercial real estate, which increased $126.4 million since year-end. Our retail loan portfolio decreased $39.7 million since year-end with a decline in our residential and consumer loan portfolio of  3% and 4%, respectively, since year-end. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company originated $291.6 million of residential mortgages and sold approximately 70% of this production. 
    
  Total deposits at September 30, 2016 were $2.9 billion, representing an increase of $162.8 million since year-end. Core deposits (demand, interest checking, savings and money market) at September 30, 2016 totaled $2.2 billion, representing an increase of $159.7 million, or 11% annualized, since year-end. Total borrowings at September 30, 2016 were $559.3 million, representing $13.1 million decrease since year-end. 
    
  Tangible book value per share   1    increased 12% to $18.87 at   September 30, 2016   since year-end. The Company declared cash dividends of $0.60 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing a dividend payout ratio of 31.99%. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Net Interest Income  
  Net interest income is the interest earned on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets, plus net loan fees, origination costs, and accretion or amortization of fair value marks on loans and/or CDs created in purchase accounting, less the interest paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income, which is our largest source of revenue and accounts for 74% and 76% of total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, is affected by factors including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, loan and deposit pricing strategies and competitive conditions, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and liabilities, and the level of non-performing assets. 
    
  Net Interest Income -   Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .    Net interest income was $28.9 million on a fully-taxable equivalent basis for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to $20.5 million for the same period last year, representing an increase of $8.4 million, or 41%. The increase was driven by higher average interest-earning assets of $891.9 million, or 34%, due to the acquisition of $628.0 million of loans and $39.7 million of investments in the fourth quarter of 2015 as part of the SBM acquisition, combined with strong organic loan growth period-over-period. Our average loan balance for the   third quarter   of   2016   totaled $2.6 billion, representing an increase of $788.4 million, or 43%, over the   third quarter   of   2015  . Our NIM (fully-taxable equivalent) for the   third quarter   of   2016   increased 16 basis points to 3.24% over the   third quarter   of   2015  . Our   third quarter     2016   NIM (fully-taxable equivalent) benefited from HPFC's higher yielding commercial loans, which will continue to decrease through normal amortization and payoffs of the existing portfolio as we are no longer originating these loans; from accretion of the loan and CD fair value marks created in purchase accounting totaling $1.0 million for the third quarter of 2016; and collection of previously charged-off acquired SBM loans of $208,000 for the third quarter of 2016. Excluding these transactions, our normalized NIM on a fully-taxable equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2016 was 3.10%, compared to 3.08% for the third quarter of 2015. 

49 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our interest expense associated with deposits and borrowings totaled $4.2 million compared to $3.0 million for the same period of   2015  , representing an increase of $1.2 million, or 39%. Our average deposit base increased 46% due to $687.0 million of deposits acquired as part of the SBM acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015 and strong organic deposit growth, highlighted by annualized core deposit growth of 11% since year-end.  
    
  The SBM acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015 improved our interest rate risk position in a rising rate environment due to the level of floating rate loans within the acquired loan portfolio as well as total deposits acquired of $687.0 million. Additionally, we continue to utilize customer loans swaps within our commercial real estate loan portfolio to improve our interest rate risk position in a rising rate environment by swapping fixed rate for variable rate. At   September 30, 2016  , our total notional on customer loan swaps with our borrowers totaled $269.0 million compared to $142.9 million at December 31, 2015 and $85.7 million at   September 30, 2015   (we have matching notional agreements with a counterparty). 
    
  The following table presents average balances, interest income, interest expense, and the corresponding average yields earned and cost of funds, as well as net interest income, net interest rate spread and NIM (fully-taxable equivalent) for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Net Interest Income -   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.    Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $86.4 million on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, compared to $61.3 million for the same period last year, representing an increase of $25.1 million, or 41%. The increase was driven by higher average interest-earning assets of $849.6 million, or 33%, due to the acquisition of $628.0 million of loans and $39.7 million of investments in the fourth quarter of 2015 as part of the SBM acquisition, combined with strong organic loan growth period-over-period. Our average loan balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $2.6 billion, representing an increase of $754.0 million, or 42%, over the same period of   2015  . Our NIM (fully-taxable equivalent) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.31% compared to 3.12% for the same period last year. Our nine months ended September 30, 2016 NIM (fully-taxable equivalent) benefited from HPFC's higher yielding commercial loans, which will continue to decrease through normal amortization and payoffs of the existing portfolio as we are no longer originating these loans; from accretion of the loan and CD fair value marks created in purchase accounting totaling $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016; and collection of previously charged-off acquired SBM loans of $984,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Excluding these transactions, our normalized NIM on a fully-taxable equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.11%, compared to 3.12% for the same period last year. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2015, we received a one-time income pick-up of $734,000 from the settlement and full pay-off of one significant commercial real estate loan that was on non-accrual status. This contributed to a one-time yield and NIM increase of 4 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding this one-time income pick-up, our NIM for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 3.08%. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our interest expense associated with deposits and borrowings totaled $12.5 million compared to $9.1 million for the same period of   2015  , representing an increase of $3.4 million, or 38%. Our average deposit base increased 46% due to $687.0 million of deposits and borrowings acquired as part of the SBM acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015 and strong organic deposit growth, highlighted by annualized core deposit growth of 11% since year-end.  
    
  The following table presents average balances, interest income, interest expense, and the corresponding average yields earned and cost of funds, as well as net interest income, net interest rate spread and NIM for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses is made up of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. 
    
  The provision for loan losses, which makes up the vast majority of the provision for credit losses, is a recorded expense determined by management that adjusts the ALL to a level that, in management s best estimate, is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including, among other factors, the levels of and trends related to non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, criticized loans, net charge-offs or recoveries and growth in the loan portfolio. Accordingly, the amount of the provision for loan losses reflects both the necessary increases in the ALL related to newly identified criticized loans, as well as the actions taken related to other loans including, among other things, any necessary increases or decreases in required allowances for specific loans or loan pools. 
    
  The provision for unfunded commitments represents management's estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses on outstanding letters and unused lines of credit. The reserve for unfunded commitments is presented within accrued interest and other liabilities on the consolidated statement of condition. 
    
  The following table outlines the components making up the provision for credit losses as recorded on consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

Please refer to   Financial Condition Asset Quality  below for additional discussion regarding the ALL and overall asset quality. 
    
  Non-Interest Income 
  The following table presents the components of non-interest income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

   54 

Non-Interest Income - Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  .    The significant changes in non-interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   were primarily due to the SBM acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and include: 
             
    An increase in debit card income of $628,000, service charges on deposit accounts of $245,000 and other service charges and fees of $175,000 primarily due to the SBM acquisition and the addition of approximately 30,000 customer checking accounts driving higher service fees along with the addition of 29 ATM's driving higher ATM fees. 
                 
    An increase in other income of $1.0 million primarily driven by the receipt of legal settlement proceeds of $638,000 related to a previously charged-off acquired loan.  
       
     Non-Interest Income - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      The significant changes in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to the SBM acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and include: 
             
    An increase in debit card income of $2.0 million, service charges on deposit accounts of $722,000 and other service charges and fees of $370,000 primarily due to the SBM acquisition and the addition of approximately 30,000 customer checking accounts driving higher service fees along with the addition of 29 ATM's driving higher ATM fees. 
                
    An increase in mortgage banking income of $3.9 million driven by the sale of $166.6 million of mortgages for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which generated gains (net of costs) on sale of $4.2 million, compared to $24.5 million of mortgage sales and gains (net of costs) of $530,000 for the same period last year. 
                 
    An increase in other income of $2.6 million primarily driven by higher income on customer loans swaps of $1.2 million, the receipt of legal settlement proceeds of $638,000 related to a previously charged-off acquired loan in the third quarter of 2016, and higher other fees due to a larger customer-base from the SBM acquisition and organic growth year-over-year.

  Non-Interest Expense - Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  .   The significant changes in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to the SBM acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and include: 
             
    An increase in salaries and employee benefits of $3.4 million driven by higher wages, commissions, bonus and incentive costs and related taxes and benefits due to the increase in the number of employees as a result of the SBM acquisition. 
                
    An increase in furniture, equipment and data processing of $644,000 driven by higher data processing charges and depreciation expense across our key systems as our number of customer accounts increased due to the SBM acquisition. 
                
    An increase in net occupancy of $491,000 due to the addition of 24 banking centers in connection with the SBM acquisition. 
                
    An increase in other real estate owned and collection costs of $334,000 primarily due to an increase in sub-servicing costs.  
                
    An increase in other expenses of $486,000 driven by the incremental costs associated with operating a larger organization due to the SBM acquisition. These incremental costs included: (i) higher customer mailing costs, courier costs, ATM surcharge rebates, telephone and communication costs, and travel and entertainment costs due to an increase in customers, locations and employees; (ii) higher donation costs (iii) hiring costs and (iv) cash back rewards program that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the SBM acquisition. 
       
  Non-Interest Expense -   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   The significant changes in non-interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were primarily due to the SBM acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and include: 
             
    An increase in salaries and employee benefits of $10.1 million driven by higher wages, commissions, bonus and incentive costs and related taxes and benefits due to the increase in the number of employees as a result of the SBM acquisition. 
                
    An increase in furniture, equipment and data processing of $1.6 million driven by higher data processing charges and depreciation expense across our key systems as our number of customer accounts increased due to the SBM acquisition. 
                
    An increase in net occupancy of $1.4 million due to the addition of 24 banking centers in connection with the SBM acquisition. 
     
   56 

An increase in other expenses of $2.0 million driven by the incremental costs associated with operating a larger organization due to the SBM acquisition. These incremental costs included: (i) higher customer mailing costs, courier costs, ATM surcharge rebates, telephone and communication costs, and travel and entertainment costs due to an increase in customers, locations and employees; (ii) higher donation costs (iii) cash back rewards program that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the SBM acquisition.

Please refer to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion and details of the discrete period items that are driving the reduction in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods last year. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Overview 
  Total assets at   September 30, 2016   were $3.9 billion compared to $3.7 billion at   December 31, 2015  , representing an increase of $194.6 million, or 7% annualized. The increase in assets was primarily driven by an increase in loan balances (excluding loans held for sale) of $101.8 million, or 5% annualized, and investments of $50.3 million, or 6%.     
    
  Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   were $2.9 billion, representing an increase of $162.8 million since year-end. Core deposits (demand, interest checking, savings and money market) at   September 30, 2016   totaled $2.2 billion, representing an increase of $159.7 million, or 11% annualized, since year-end. Total borrowings at   September 30, 2016   totaled $559.3 million, representing an increase of $13.1 million since year-end. 
    
  Total shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $393.2 million  , an increase of $30.0 million, or 8% since year-end. 
    
  Investment Securities 
  We purchase and hold investment securities including municipal bonds, MBS (pass through securities and CMOs), subordinated corporate bonds and FHLB and FRB stock to diversify our revenues, interest rate and credit risk, and to provide for liquidity and funding needs. At   September 30, 2016  , our total investment securities holdings were   $906.3 million  , an   increase   of $50.3 million since   December 31, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we purchased $140.7 million of debt securities and received proceeds from the sale and maturity of debt securities totaling $105.9 million. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we classified all municipal bonds purchased as HTM securities. In total, we purchased $10.4 million of municipal bonds year-to-date. We have the intent and ability, evidenced by our strong capital and liquidity ratios, to hold these investments to maturity. The remaining $130.3 million of securities purchased were a combination of MBS, CMO and subordinated corporate debt securities. All of these investments have been categorized as AFS securities and are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of condition with the associated unrealized gains or losses recorded in AOCI, net of tax. At   September 30, 2016  , we had a $  6.6 million   net unrealized gain on our AFS securities, net of tax, compared to a   $3.8 million   net unrealized loss, net of tax, at   December 31, 2015  . The fluctuation in the fair value of our MBS and CMO investment securities is highly dependent on interest rates as of the end of the reporting period and is not reflective of an overall credit deterioration within our portfolio. 
    
  We started purchasing subordinated corporate bonds in December 2015 and continued through 2016. Subordinated corporate bonds are subordinated notes issued by U.S. banks and bank holding companies that meet certain underwriting criteria with coupons ranging from 5.00% to 6.25% and 10 year maturities with call options that can be exercised by the issuer after five years. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of our subordinated corporate bonds was $5.7 million and $996,000, respectively. We have designated our subordinated corporate bond investments as AFS.  
    
  The duration of our investment securities portfolio decreased slightly to 3.9 years at   September 30, 2016   from 4.0 years at   December 31, 2015  .  This decrease was due to a higher mix of MBS and CMO investments purchased in 2016, making up 82% of our total investment purchases. MBS and CMO investments have a shorter weighted-average life than the municipal bonds. We generally purchase MBS and CMO investments with an average life of no longer than six years to limit prepayment risk compared to fifteen years for a municipal bond. 
    
  We completed our quarterly OTTI assessment for our investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and concluded that no OTTI existed across our investment portfolio. Our process and methodology for analyzing our investments portfolio for OTTI  
  
   57 

has not changed since last disclosed within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for further discussion of the Company's process and methodology. 
    
  FHLBB and FRB Bank Stock 
  We are required to maintain a level of investment in FHLBB stock based on the Bank's level of our FHLBB advances. In the first nine months of 2016, the Bank purchased $2.9 million of additional FHLBB stock, and in the third quarter sold $5.7 million to bring its investment in line with its borrowings. Our investment balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $17.8 million and $20.6 million, respectively. No market exists for shares of FHLBB stock. 
    
  We are required to maintain a level of investment in FRB stock based on the Company and Acadia Trust's shareholders' equity position. In the second quarter, the Company and Acadia Trust purchased $4.5 million of additional FRB stock. Our investment balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $5.4 million and $908,000, respectively. No market exists for shares of FRB stock. 
    
  Loans 
  We provide loans primarily to customers located within our geographic market area. Our primary market continues to be in Maine, making up 85% of our loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  ; however, our loan production outside of Maine and through New England has increased with our expanded presence in Southern Maine and New Hampshire. The commercial loan portfolio increased $141.5 million, or 11%, since   December 31, 2015  , while the retail loan portfolio decreased $39.7 million over the same period. The decrease in our retail loan portfolio since year-end was primarily driven by a decrease in residential mortgage loans of $23.6 million. The Company has sold approximately 70% of its originated residential mortgages for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to generate fee income and enhance its interest rate sensitivity. For the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016  , the Company sold $71.4 million and $166.6 million of residential mortgage loans and recognized net gains of $2.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, compared to residential mortgage sales of $11.9 million and $24.5 million and net gains of $243,000 and $530,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , loans held for sale totaled $24.6 million, representing an increase of $13.7 million since   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: 

BOLI 
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company made an additional BOLI investment of $16.7 million. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we received proceeds of $578,000 on the passing of one of the insureds under our policy. Of this amount, we recognized $394,000 as income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the death benefits received, which was non-taxable. Our BOLI investment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $77.9 million and $59.9 million, respectively. 
  
   58 

Asset Quality 
    
  Non-Performing Assets  .  Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, accruing TDRs, and property acquired through foreclosure or repossession. The following table sets forth the make-up and amount of our non-performing assets as of the dates indicated:  

Our non-performing assets to total assets ratio at   September 30, 2016   was 0.67%, representing an increase of 1 basis point since year-end. The increase in non-performing assets period-over-period was driven by the increase in non-accrual loans of $2.7 million, which was driven by placing one commercial loan with a recorded investment balance of $11.3 million at September 30, 2016 on non-accrual status in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding this one commercial real estate loan, non-accrual loans decreased $9.0 million, which reflects the general financial condition improvement across our borrowers, as well as our continued foreclosure and auction activity within our retail loan portfolio. 
    
  Potential Problem Loans  .  Potential problem loans consist of classified accruing commercial and commercial real estate loans that were between 30 and 89 days past due. Such loans are characterized by weaknesses in the financial condition of borrowers or collateral deficiencies. Based on historical experience, the credit quality of some of these loans may improve due to changes in collateral values or the financial condition of the borrowers, while the credit quality of other loans may deteriorate, resulting in a loss. These loans are not included in the above analysis of non-accrual loans. At   September 30, 2016  , potential problem loans amounted to $885,000, or 0.03% of total loans and 0.06% of our commercial loan portfolio, compared to $649,000, or 0.03% of total loans and 0.05% of our commercial loan portfolio, at   December 31, 2015  . 

59 

Past Due Loans  .  Past due loans consist of accruing loans that were between 30 and 89 days past due. The following table sets forth information concerning the past due loans at the date indicated: 

Allowance for Loan Losses  .  We use a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio for purposes of establishing a sufficient ALL. The ALL is management s best estimate of the probable loan losses as of the balance sheet date. The ALL is increased by provisions charged to earnings and by recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, and is reduced by charge-offs on loans. 
  
   60 

The following table sets forth information concerning the activity in our ALL during the periods indicated.  

The determination of an appropriate level of ALL, and subsequent provision for loan losses which affects earnings, is based on our analysis of various economic factors and review of the loan portfolio. During our analysis and review, many factors are considered including, but not limited to, loan growth, payoffs of lower quality loans, recoveries on previously charged-off loans, improvement in the financial condition of the borrowers, risk rating downgrades/upgrades and charge-offs. We utilize a comprehensive approach toward determining the ALL, which includes an expanded risk rating system to assist us in identifying the risks being undertaken. 
    
  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we provided $1.3 million and $5.0 million of provision for loan loss expense to the ALL compared to $281,000 and $972,000 for the same period for   2015  , respectively. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 was driven by the higher concentration of commercial real estate and commercial loans as a percentage of our total loans at September 30, 2016 of 56% compared to 52% at September 30, 2015, as well as higher net charge-offs for HPFC in the third quarter of 2016 of $205,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increase in our provision for loan losses over the same period last year was also driven by the  
  
   61 

change in our loan mix with a higher concentration of commercial real estate and commercial loans as a percentage of total loans, but also due to 5% annualized loan growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and deterioration of one commercial real estate and one commercial credit accounting for $2.3 million of provision expense recorded in the second quarter of 2016. The commercial credit was an acquired relationship that was previously designated as a non-accrual loan upon acquisition in October 2015. The fair value mark on the acquired relationship estimated within our purchase accounting for the loan was not sufficient, and, thus required incremental provision for loan loss to record the relationship at its estimated value. In the third quarter of 2016, we charged-off the $1.4 million reserve previously established for the aforementioned commercial loan, which drove the 18 basis points increase in our annualized quarter-to-date net charge-off to average loans ratio compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Overall, our asset quality remains strong with non-performing assets to total assets of 0.67%, and loans 30-89 days past due to total loans of 0.17%. 
    
  We believe the ALL of $23.3 million, or 0.90% of total loans and 91.35% of total non-performing loans, at   September 30, 2016   was appropriate given the current economic conditions in our service area and the condition of the loan portfolio. However, if conditions deteriorate the provision will likely increase. 
    
  Liabilities and Shareholders  Equity 
  Deposits and Borrowings.    Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   were $2.9 billion, representing an increase of $162.8 million, or 6%, since year-end. Core deposits (demand, interest checking, savings and money market) at   September 30, 2016   totaled $2.2 billion, representing an increase of $159.7 million, or 11% annualized since year-end. The increase in core deposits was due to the combination of growth and seasonality of our core deposits across our markets throughout Maine (consistent with last year). Brokered deposits at September 30, 2016 of $229.2 million increased $30.1 million since year-end to supplement the decrease in CDs of $27.0 million since year-end. 
    
  Shareholders' Equity.    Total shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $393.2 million  , representing an increase of $30.0 million, or 8%, since   December 31, 2015  . The increase was largely due to net income of $29.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and an increase in the net change on unrealized gains on AFS securities, net of tax, of $10.4 million due to the decrease in interest rates since year-end, partially offset by dividends declared of $0.60 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $9.3 million and an increase in the net change on unrealized losses, net of tax, on our interest rate swaps arrangements designated as hedges of $2.5 million due to the decrease in interest rates since year-end. 
    
  On August 30, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend on the Company's common stock. The three-for-two stock split was payable September 30, 2016, to the Company's common shareholders of record on September 15, 2016. As a result of the three-for-two stock split, the Company's historical per share financial information and ratios throughout have been retrospectively adjusted to restate prior period financial information. 
    
  The following table presents certain information regarding shareholders  equity as of or for the periods indicated: 

(1) This is a non-GAAP measure. Refer to " Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP" for further details. 
  (2) Prior periods adjusted to reflect three-for-two stock split effective September 30, 2016. 
    
  Refer to "Capital Resources" and Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements further discussion of the Company and Bank's capital resources and regulatory capital requirements.

LIQUIDITY 
    
  Our liquidity needs require the availability of cash to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors and credit commitments to borrowers. Liquidity is defined as our ability to maintain availability of funds to meet customer needs, as well as to support our asset base. The primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds to meet our cash flow needs in the most economical and expedient manner. Due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in both deposits and loans, active management of liquidity is necessary. We maintain various sources of funding and levels of liquid assets in excess of regulatory guidelines in order to satisfy their varied liquidity demands. We monitor liquidity in accordance with internal guidelines and all applicable regulatory requirements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our level of liquidity exceeded target levels. We believe that we currently have appropriate liquidity available to respond to liquidity demands. Sources of funds that we utilize consist of deposits; borrowings from the FHLBB and other sources; cash flows from operations; prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans; investments and mortgage-backed securities, of which the fair value at   September 30, 2016   of investment securities designated as AFS, were in an unrealized gain position and were not pledged as collateral totaled $207.4 million; and the sale of mortgage loans. 
    
  Deposits continue to represent our primary source of funds. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , average deposits (excluding brokered deposits) of $2.5 billion increased $798.4 million, or 46%, compared to the same period last year. Average core deposits of $2.0 billion for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $619.2 million, or 44%, compared to the same period a year ago due to the core deposits acquired in connection with the SBM acquisition of $497.4 million on October 16, 2015, as well as organic growth. Included within our money market deposit category are deposits from our wealth management subsidiary, Acadia Trust, which represent client funds. The deposits in the Acadia Trust client accounts, totaled $64.0 million at   September 30, 2016  . These deposits fluctuate with changes in the portfolios of the clients of Acadia Trust. 
    
  Borrowings are used to supplement deposits as a source of liquidity. In addition to borrowings and advances from the FHLBB, we utilize brokered deposits, purchase federal funds, and sell securities under agreements to repurchase. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   average total borrowings (including brokered deposits) increased $69.3 million to $865.5 million compared to the same period last year. We secure borrowings from the FHLBB, whose advances remain the largest non-deposit-related funding source, with qualified residential real estate loans, certain investment securities and certain other assets available to be pledged. Through the Bank, we have available lines of credit with the FHLBB of $9.9 million, with PNC Bank of $50.0 million, and with the FRB Discount Window of $74.6 million as of   September 30, 2016  . We had no outstanding balances on these lines of credit at   September 30, 2016  . Long-term borrowings represent securities sold under repurchase agreements with major brokerage firms. Both wholesale and customer repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities and government-sponsored enterprises. The Company also has a $10.0 million line of credit with a maturity date of December 20, 2016. We had no outstanding balance on these lines of credit at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We believe the investment portfolio and residential loan portfolio provide a significant amount of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through sales of those portfolios. We also believe that we have additional untapped access to the brokered deposit market, wholesale reverse repurchase transaction market and the FRB discount window. These sources are considered as liquidity alternatives in our contingent liquidity plan. We believe that the level of liquidity is sufficient to meet current and future funding requirements; however, changes in economic conditions, including consumer saving habits and the availability or access to the national brokered deposit and wholesale repurchase markets, could significantly impact our liquidity position.

CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  As part of our goal to operate a safe, sound and profitable financial organization, we are committed to maintaining a strong capital base. Shareholders  equity totaled $393.2 million, $363.2 million and $259.4 million at   September 30, 2016  , December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, which amounted to 10%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of total assets as of the respective dates. Refer to "  Financial Condition   Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity" for discussion regarding changes in shareholders' equity since   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Our principal cash requirement is the payment of dividends on our common stock, as and when declared by the Board of Directors. We declared dividends to shareholders in the aggregate amount of $9.3 million, $7.6 million and $6.0 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   2015   and 2014, respectively. The increase in dividends declared in the first nine months of   2016   of $1.7 million compared to the first nine months of   2015   was primarily due to the increase in common shares outstanding in connection with the SBM acquisition for which 4.1 million shares were issued, as adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective September 30, 2016. Our Board of Directors approves cash dividends on a quarterly basis after careful analysis and consideration of various factors, including the following: (i) capital position relative to total assets, (ii) risk-based assets, (iii) total classified assets, (iv) economic conditions, (v) growth rates for total assets and total liabilities, (vi) earnings performance and projections and (vii) strategic initiatives and related capital requirements. All dividends declared and distributed by the Company have been and will be in compliance with applicable state corporate law and regulatory requirements. 
    
  We are primarily dependent upon the payment of cash dividends by our subsidiaries to service our commitments. We, as the sole shareholder of our subsidiaries, are entitled to dividends, when and as declared by each subsidiary s Board of Directors from legally available funds. The Bank declared dividends to the Company in the aggregate amount of $10.9 million, $39.2 million, which includes a $30.0 million special dividend related to the acquisition of SBM, and $9.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   2015   and 2014, respectively. Under regulations prescribed by the OCC, without prior OCC approval, the Bank may not declare dividends in any year in excess of the Bank s (i) net income for the current year, (ii) plus its retained net income for the prior two years. If we are required to use dividends from the Bank to service unforeseen commitments in the future, we may be required to reduce the dividends paid to our shareholders going forward. 
    
  Please refer to Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion and details of the Company and Bank's capital regulatory requirements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company and Bank met all regulatory capital requirements and the Bank continues to be classified as "well capitalized" under the prompt correction action provisions. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 
    
  In the normal course of business, we are a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, which are not reflected in the consolidated statements of condition. These financial instruments include lending commitments and letters of credit. Those instruments involve varying degrees of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of condition. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments, including requiring similar collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. At   September 30, 2016  , we had the following levels of commitments to extend credit: 

64 

We are a party to several on- and off-balance sheet contractual obligations through various borrowing agreements and lease agreements on a number of branch facilities. We have an obligation and commitment to make future payments under these contracts. At   September 30, 2016  , we had the following levels of contractual obligations:  

Borrowings from the FHLBB consist of short- and long-term fixed- and variable-rate borrowings and are collateralized by all stock in the FHLBB and a blanket lien on qualified collateral consisting primarily of loans with first mortgages secured by one- to four-family properties, certain pledged investment securities and other qualified assets. We have an obligation and commitment to repay all borrowings and debentures. These commitments, borrowings, subordinated debentures and the related payments are made during the normal course of business. 
    
  Derivatives 
    
  Hedge Instruments:   From time to time, we may enter into derivative instruments as partial hedges against large fluctuations in interest rates. We may also enter into fixed-rate interest rate swaps and floor instruments to partially hedge against potentially lower yields on the variable prime rate loan category in a declining rate environment. If interest rates were to decline, resulting in reduced income on the adjustable rate loans, there would be an increased income flow from the interest rate swap and floor instrument. We may also enter into variable rate interest rate swaps and cap instruments to partially hedge against increases in short-term borrowing rates. If interest rates were to rise, resulting in an increased interest cost, there would be an increased income flow from the interest rate swaps and cap instruments. These financial instruments are factored into our overall interest rate risk position. We regularly review the credit quality of the counterparty from which the instruments have been purchased.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had $43.0 million of notional in interest rate swaps on our junior subordinated debentures. The arrangement allowed us to fix our floating rate debentures and mitigate our interest exposure in a rising rate environment. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the interest rate swaps were in a loss position of $12.7 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and were recorded as a liability within our consolidated statements of condition.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had $50.0 million of notional on two tranches of 30-day FHLBB advances. Each derivative arrangement commenced on February 25, 2016, with one contract set to expire on February 25, 2018 and the other on February 25, 2019. We entered into these interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate exposure on borrowings in a rising interest rate environment. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the interest rate swaps were in a loss position of $847,000 and $576,000 and were recorded as a liability within our consolidated statements of condition. 
    
  Refer to Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

65 

Customer Loan Swaps:   In our normal course lending with commercial real estate customers, we will enter into interest rate swaps with qualifying commercial customers, from time to time, to provide them with a means to lock into a long-term fixed rate, while simultaneously entering into an arrangement with a counterparty to swap the long-term fixed rate loan to variable rate to allow us to effectively manage our interest rate exposure. Unlike the aforementioned cash flow hedges above, these arrangements are not designated as hedges and provide little risk to us as the interest rate swap agreements have substantially equivalent and offsetting terms. We mitigate our commercial customer counterparty credit risk exposure through our loan policy and underwriting process, which includes credit approval limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. We mitigate our institutional counterparty credit risk exposure by limiting the institutions for which we will enter into interest swap arrangements through an approved listing by the Company's board of directors. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had a notional amount of $269.0 million and $142.9 million, respectively, in interest rate swap agreements with commercial customers and an equal notional amount with a dealer bank related to our commercial loan swap program. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the fair value of these arrangements were $14.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and were recorded gross on our consolidated statements of condition as assets and liabilities. As the interest rate swap agreements have substantially equivalent and offsetting terms, they do not materially change our interest rate risk or present any material exposure to our consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Refer to Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
    
  Interest Rate Locks:   As part of our normal mortgage origination process, we provide potential borrowers with the option to lock their interest rate based on current market prices. During the period from commitment date to the loan closing date, we are subject to interest rate risk as market rates fluctuate. In an effort to mitigate such risk, we may enter into forward delivery sales commitments, typically on a "best-efforts" basis, with certain approved investors. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had a notional amount of $55.2 million and $20.7 million, respectively, of interest rate lock commitments on mortgages within our loan pipeline. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the fair value of our interest rate locks was $749,000 and $139,000, respectively, and was recorded as assets on our consolidated statements of condition. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   2016 and 2015, we recorded the change in unrealized gains on these interest rate lock commitments of $226,000, $610,000, $14,000 and $33,000, respectively, within mortgage banking income (net) on the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Refer to Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  MARKET RISK 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the economic values of certain assets and liabilities arising from adverse changes to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. Our only significant market risk exposure is changes in interest rates. The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset/liability management process, which is governed by policies established by the Bank s board of directors, and are reviewed and approved annually. The Board ALCO delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset/liability management policies to Management ALCO. In this capacity, Management ALCO develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset/liability management-related activities based upon estimated interest rate risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels/trends. Management ALCO and Board ALCO jointly meet on a quarterly basis to review strategies, policies, economic conditions and various activities as part of the management of these risks.  Management ALCO manages interest rate risk by using two risk measurement techniques: (i) simulation of net interest income and (ii) simulation of economic value of equity.  These measures are complementary and provide for both short and long-term risk profiles of the Company. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change, thereby impacting net interest income, the primary component of our earnings. Board ALCO and Management ALCO utilize the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes. Board ALCO and Management ALCO routinely monitor simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling five-year horizon. 
    
  The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates, interest rate indices and spreads, rate caps and floors on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our consolidated statements of condition, as well as for derivative financial instruments, if any. The simulation of net interest income also requires a number of key assumptions such as: (i) no balance sheet growth, (ii) the future balance sheet mix, including prepayment assumptions for loans and securities projected under each rate scenario, (iii) new business loan rates that are based on recent origination experience, (iv) deposit pricing beta assumptions, and (v) non-maturity decay rate estimates.  These assumptions can be inherently uncertain, and, as a result, actual results may differ from the simulation forecasts due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of rate changes, future business conditions and unanticipated changes in management strategies. This sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one- and two-year horizon given a 200 basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates. Although our policy specifies a downward shift of 200 basis points, this would result in negative rates as many deposit and funding rates are now below 2.00%. Our current downward shift is 100 basis points. A parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a 12-month period is assumed. Using this approach, we are able to produce simulation results that illustrate the effect that both a gradual change of rates have on earnings expectations. In the down 100 basis points scenario, Federal Funds and Treasury yields are floored at 0.01% while Prime is floored at 3.00%. All other market rates are floored at 0.25%. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our net interest income sensitivity analysis reflected the following changes to net interest income. All rate changes were  ramped  over the first 12-month period and then maintained at those levels over the remainder of the ALCO simulation horizon. 

67 

The most significant factors affecting the changes in market risk exposure at   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   were the acquisition of SBM, which increased the mix of variable rate loans and increased core deposits, and an increase in back-to-back loan swaps. If rates remain at or near current levels, net interest income is projected to decrease slightly in year 1 and year 2 as loan rates have repriced to current rates and the cost of funds remains unchanged. If rates decrease 100 basis points, net interest income is projected to decrease slightly as changes in loan and funding costs almost offset in the first year. In the second year, net interest income is projected to continue to decrease as loans and investment cash flow reprice into lower yields as prepayments increase while the cost of funds remains flat. If rates increase 200 basis points, net interest income is projected to decrease in the first year due to the repricing of short-term funding. Then in the second year, net interest income is projected to increase as loans and investments continue to reprice/reset into higher yields while the cost of funds lag. At this point, the Company's balance sheet becomes asset sensitive. In years three to five, the loan and investment cash flows continue to reprice as the cost of funds lags increasing net interest income above our base. 
    
  The economic value of equity at risk simulation is conducted in tandem with the net interest income simulations, to determine a longer term view of the Company s interest rate risk position by capturing longer-term re-pricing risk and option-risk embedded in the balance sheet. It measures the sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates. The economic value of equity at risk simulation values only the current balance sheet. As with net interest income modeling, this simulation captures product characteristics such as loan resets, re-pricing terms, maturity dates, rate caps and floors. Key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds, deposit pricing betas and non-maturity deposit decay rates. These assumptions can have significant impacts on valuation results as the assumptions remain in effect for the entire life of each asset and liability. All key assumptions are subject to a periodic review. 
    
  Our base case economic value of equity at risk is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. 

(1) Assumes instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates. 
    
  Periodically, if deemed appropriate, we use interest rate swaps, floors and caps, which are common derivative financial instruments, to hedge our interest rate risk position. The Company s Board of Directors has approved hedging policy statements governing the use of these instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , we had $43.0 million notional principal amount of interest rate swap agreements related to our junior subordinated debentures, $50.0 million notional principal amount of interest rate swap agreements related to our short-term funding and $269.0 million notional principal amount of interest rate swap agreements related to the Company s commercial loan level derivative program with the participating borrower and counterparty. The Board ALCO and Management ALCO monitor derivative activities relative to their expectations and our hedging policies.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the Company s management conducted an evaluation with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial   Accounting Officer), regarding the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the last fiscal quarter covered by this report.  In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company and its management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial   Accounting Officer) concluded that they believe the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
    
  There was no change in the internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
