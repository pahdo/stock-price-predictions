  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (UNAUDITED)      1. Basis of Presentation
    The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of NCI, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively  NCI  or the
 Company ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U. S. ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U. S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ). As a result, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and its results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which consists of normal and recurring adjustments. The information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for these periods is
unaudited. The current period s results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any future period. All numbers in tables are presented in thousands except per share numbers. For further information,
refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in NCI s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC .    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements     On
November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as
non-current in a classified balance sheet. As permitted, the Company elected to early adopt this ASU using the retrospective approach, effective with its Form 10-Q filing for March 31, 2016. As a result of adopting this ASU, current net
deferred taxes of $4.0 million were reclassified to net non-current deferred taxes as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 had no impact on the Company s consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2015 or the condensed consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities arising from capital leases and
operating leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position, respectively. The Company will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact that
the standard may have on its consolidated balance sheet. The actual impact will depend on the Company s lease portfolio at the time of adoption.    In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance with respect to principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In April 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies the implementation guidance with respect to identifying promised goods or services from a principal and agent perspective under ASU 2014-09. The Company will adopt the standard effective January 1,
2018 and is continuing to evaluate the full effect that ASU 2014-09 and related subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including immediate recognition of
all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the employees  maximum statutory tax rates, allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either
estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur, and clarifying the classification on the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares
for tax-withholding purposes. The Company is evaluating the full effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2017, but at this time believe it will not have a
material effect on its consolidated financial statements when it is adopted by the Company in 2017.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which
provides updated guidance on eight specific cash flow issues and how they should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. The eight specific cash flow issues addressed are
being evaluated by the Company as to the likelihood of those cash flow transactions occurring and potential corresponding effect on the Company s statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018.

   2. Business Overview   
 NCI is a leading provider of enterprise solutions and services to U.S. defense, intelligence, health care and civilian government agencies. The Company has the
expertise and proven track record to solve its customers  most important and complex mission challenges through technology and innovation. The Company s team of highly skilled professionals focuses on delivering cost-effective solutions
and services in the areas of agile software application and systems development/integration; cybersecurity and information assurance; engineering and logistics support; enterprise information management and advanced analytics; cloud computing and IT
infrastructure optimization; health IT and medical support; IT service management; and modeling, simulation and training. Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, the Company has approximately 2,000 employees operating at more than 100 locations
worldwide. The majority of the Company s revenue is derived from contracts with the U.S. Federal Government, directly as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor. NCI primarily conducts business throughout the U. S. The Company reports
operating results and financial data as one reportable segment.    NCI s Program Executive Office Soldier ( PEO Soldier ) contract is the
Company s largest revenue-generating contract and accounted for approximately 16% and 9% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. PEO Soldier accounted for approximately 16% and 10% of revenue for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s PEO Soldier program is a cost-plus fee contract consisting of a base period and four option periods for a total term of five years, which commenced in October
2015. NCI s Cyber Network Operations and Security Support ( CNOSS ) program, supporting the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command accounted for approximately 12% and 7% of revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. CNOSS accounted for approximately 11% and 6% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This cost-plus-fixed-fee, single-award indefinite delivery indefinite
quantity contract consists of a 12-month base period with two one-year option periods and one six-month option period, and commenced in October 2014.  
  3. Earnings Per Share     Basic earnings per share excludes
dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted earnings per share include the incremental effect of stock options calculated using the treasury stock method. Shares that are anti-dilutive are not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 25,000 and 30,000 shares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because to do so would have been
anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 11,000 and 63,000 shares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive. The
following table details the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (Class A and Class B) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

   Other unbilled receivables primarily consist of amounts that will be billed upon milestone completions and other accrued
amounts that cannot be billed as of the end of the period. Substantially all unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected within the next 12 months.  
  5. Property and Equipment     The following table details
property and equipment at the end of each period:      
   Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.8 million.

   Amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.9 million and
$1.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Intangible assets are primarily amortized on a straight line basis over
periods ranging from three to 11 years. Expected amortization expense for the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, and for each of the fiscal years thereafter, is as follows:

7. Share-Based Payments   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not grant any stock options, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company granted 25,000 stock options to purchase shares of Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $13.29, which represents the fair market value of the Company s Class A common stock at the date of grant. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, a total of 35,426 stock options were exercised at a weighted-average exercise price of $6.38. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a total of 73,758 stock options were exercised at a
weighted-average exercise price of $5.66. As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,499,074 stock options outstanding.    During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, no restricted stock was granted and 5,000 shares of restricted stock were cancelled. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 25,000 shares of restricted stock were granted and 25,000 shares of restricted stock
were cancelled. As of September 30, 2016, there were 315,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding.    The following table summarizes stock
compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue and general and administrative costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $3.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
unvested stock compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be fully amortized over the next five years, with approximately $0.2 million, $0.9 million, $0.9 million, $0.7 million and $0.6 million amortized during the remainder of 2016, and
the full years of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The cost of stock compensation is included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and expensed over the service period of the options.  
  8. Debt     NCI s senior credit facility, amended in
December 2014, and referred to herein as the  credit facility,  consists of a revolving line of credit with a borrowing capacity of up to an $80.0 million principal amount and a $45.0 million accordion feature allowing the Company to
increase its borrowing capacity to up to a $125.0 million principal amount, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity from existing or new lenders. The outstanding borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in
substantially all of the Company s assets. The lenders also require a direct assignment of all contracts at the lenders  discretion. The outstanding balance under the credit facility accrues interest based on the one-month London Interbank
offered rate or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, ranging from 210 to 310 basis points, based on the ratio of the Company s outstanding senior funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization or EBITDA, as defined
in the credit facility. The credit facility expires on January 31, 2017. Accordingly all borrowings are classified as current liabilities as they are due and payable within the next 12 months.  
 The credit facility contains various covenants that limit, among other things, the Company s ability to incur or guarantee additional debt; make certain
distributions, investments and other restricted payments, including limits on cash dividends on the Company s outstanding common stock or equivalent equity interests; enter into transactions with certain affiliates; create or permit certain
liens; and consolidate, merge, or sell assets. In addition, the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, maintain a minimum funded debt to earnings ratio; and
limit capital expenditures below certain thresholds. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its loan covenants.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  The credit facility allows the Company to use borrowings thereunder of up to $17.5 million to repurchase
outstanding shares of Class A common stock. No stock repurchases took place in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $16.7 million was remaining under the board of directors  authorization for
share repurchases.    During the third quarter of 2016, the Company had a weighted average outstanding loan balance of $6.5 million which accrued interest
at a weighted average borrowing rate of 2.5%. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company had a weighted average outstanding loan balance of $18.8 million which accrued interest at a weighted average borrowing rate of 2.3%.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility.  
  9. Computech Acquisition     On January 1, 2015, the
Company completed its purchase of 100% of the outstanding stock of Computech, Inc. ( Computech ), a leader in agile and lean application software development and IT operations and maintenance, for approximately $56.7 million, net of cash
acquired. The acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the total purchase consideration to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair value. The
excess of the purchase consideration over the amounts assigned to tangible or intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill.  
  Allocation of Purchase Price     The Company has completed
the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Computech. The fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired were based on estimates, assumptions, and other information compiled by management, including independent
valuations that utilized established valuation techniques. Based on the Company s valuation, the total consideration of approximately $56.7 million, net of $3.3 million of cash acquired, has been allocated to assets acquired (including
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill) and liabilities assumed, as follows:      
   The definite life intangibles recognized in the allocation of the Computech purchase price consists of $18.6 million in
contracts and customer relationships and $1.1 million in developed software. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible asset for contracts and customer relationships is based on existing customer contracts and anticipated follow-on contracts
with existing customers and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected life of seven years. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible asset for developed software will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected
useful life of three years.    All goodwill and intangible asset amortization related to the acquisition of Computech is expected to be deductible for
income tax purposes.     10. Dividends     Our board of
directors declared and the Company paid the following dividends during the periods presented:      
    11. Related Party Transactions   
 The Company purchases services under a subcontract from Renegade Technology Systems, Inc., which is a government contractor wholly-owned by Rajiv Narang, the
son of Charles K. Narang, Chairman of the board of directors. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the expense incurred under this agreement was approximately $298,000 and $177,000, respectively. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the expense incurred under this agreement was approximately $656,000 and $525,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, outstanding amounts due to Renegade Technology Systems, Inc. under this
agreement were $103,150 and $51,137, respectively.

   12. Contingencies   
  Government Audits     Payments to the Company
on U.S. Federal Government contracts are subject to adjustment upon audit by various agencies of the U.S. Federal Government. Audits of costs and the related payments have been performed through 2007 for NCI Information Systems, Inc., the
Company s primary corporate vehicle for government contracting. In the opinion of management, the final determination of costs and related payments for unaudited years will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.     Litigation   
 The Company is party to various legal actions, claims, government inquiries, and audits resulting from the normal course of business. The Company believes that
the probability is remote that any resulting liability will have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  
  13. Subsequent Events      Change in
Management     On October 31, 2016, the Company announced that Brian J. Clark, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ),
has resigned from his employment with the Company and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, effective as of October 31, 2016. In connection with his resignation, the Company and Mr. Clark entered into a Separation and Transition
Agreement which provides for the payment of certain severance benefits to Mr. Clark including the following: (a) the Company will pay Mr. Clark a total fee of $250,000 for consulting services to be provided through April 30, 2017; (b) the Company
will pay Mr. Clark a lump sum cash payment equal to twenty-four months of his annual base salary in the amount of $1,000,000; (c) the Company will pay Mr. Clark a lump sum cash payment equal to his prorated annual bonus for 2016 at the target level
of performance in the amount of $420,000; (d) the Company will continue to provide Mr. Clark with health and welfare coverage and executive long-term disability coverage at no additional cost to him for one year; and (e) the Company will repurchase
390,000 stock options held by Mr. Clark that are vested and exercisable as of October 31, 2016 at a purchase price per option equal to the closing sale price of a share of NCI common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on October 28, 2016 less the
applicable per share exercise price of the options.    The Board has appointed Paul A. Dillahay as the Company s President and CEO and a member of the
Board effective as of October 31, 2016. Mr. Dillahay will initially receive a one-time signing bonus in the amount of $325,000 and will be eligible for an annual cash bonus for the fourth quarter of 2016 equal to $125,000. He will receive an
option award of 250,000 shares and a grant of 100,000 shares of restricted stock. The options vest in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The restricted stock awards vest in accordance with the
following schedule: 33 1/3% vest on January 31, 2017; 33 1/3% vest one year from the grant date and 33 1/3% vest two years from the grant date.       
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Forward-Looking Statements

  Key Financial Metrics      Prime
Contractor Revenue     The following table shows our revenue derived from contracts on which we serve as a prime contractor.

   Customer Group Revenue   
 The following table shows our revenue from the customer groups listed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods shown.  
   
    Contract Type Revenue   
 Our services and solutions are provided under three types of contracts: time-and-materials; cost-plus fee; and firm fixed-price. Our contract mix varies from
year to year due to numerous factors including our business strategies and U.S. Federal Government procurement objectives.    The following table shows our
revenue from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods shown.      
 
      11  

Table of Contents  

  The amount of risk and potential reward varies under each type of contract. Under time-and-materials contracts,
we are paid a fixed hourly rate by labor category. To the extent that our actual labor costs vary significantly from the negotiated hourly rates, we may generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit. We are typically reimbursed for other
contract direct costs and expenses at our cost, and typically receive no fee on those costs. For cost-plus fee contracts, there is limited financial risk, because we are reimbursed all our allowable costs, therefore the profit margins tend to be
lower on cost-plus fee contracts. Under firm fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks or provide specified goods for a predetermined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-plus fee contracts, firm fixed-price service contracts
generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we would bear the impact of potential cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings.  
  Contract Backlog       
   We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts over the remaining base
contract performance period and from the option periods of those contracts that we believe are more likely than not to be exercised. Our backlog does not include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under our GWAC,
agency-specific IDIQ, or other multiple-award contract vehicles. We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and obligated to us under a contract or other authorization for payment signed by an
authorized purchasing agency, less the amount of revenue we have previously recognized. Our funded backlog does not represent the full potential value of our contracts, as Congress often appropriates funds for a particular program or agency on a
quarterly or yearly basis, even though the contract may provide for the provision of services over a number of years. We define our unfunded backlog, which is not included above, as the total backlog less the funded backlog. Unfunded backlog
includes values for contract options that have been priced but not yet funded. Additional information on how we determine backlog is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.  
  Results of Operations      Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     The following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated
statements of income and expresses each item in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:      
 
      12  

Table of Contents  

    Revenue    
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenue decreased by 3.1%, or $2.6 million, over the same period a year ago. The decrease was due mostly to
completed contracts, and reductions in staffing and scope of work on certain contracts, partially offset by higher revenues derived under the expanded PEO Soldier program, CNOSS program, and other new contract awards in the past year.  
 NCI s PEO Soldier program accounted for $12.7 million, or 16.0% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2016, up $5.4 million from $7.3 million, or 8.8% of
revenue, in the third quarter of 2015. NCI s CNOSS program accounted for $9.9 million, or 12.2% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2016, up $4.5 million from $5.4 million, or 6.6% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2015.  
   Cost of revenue      Cost of revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was $66.3 million, or 83.1% of revenue, compared to $68.7 million, or 83.4% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily the result of lower
subcontractor and materials costs, partially offset by higher direct labor and an increase in indirect costs for the period.      General and
administrative expenses      General and administrative expenses decreased 0.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the
same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to decreased stock compensation expense.      Depreciation and amortization    
 Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $1.7 million and $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The decrease was primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in the beginning of the third quarter of 2016.  
   Interest expense, net      Interest expense, net, was
$0.1 million and $0.2 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the third quarter of 2016, we had a weighted average outstanding loan balance of $6.5 million which accrued interest at a weighted average
borrowing rate of 2.5%. During the third quarter of 2015, we had a weighted average outstanding loan balance of $18.8 million which accrued interest at a weighted average borrowing rate of 2.3%.  
   Provision for income taxes      Provision for income
taxes decreased by $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective income tax rate for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately
36.6% and 38.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to a discrete item in the quarter for the period ended September 30, 2016 related to a corporate tax structure reorganization.

   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 The following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and expresses each item in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for
the periods indicated:      
     Revenue      For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenue decreased 1.5%, or $3.8 million from $249.1 million to $245.3 million, as compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to, reductions in scope of work, the expiration
of task orders and contracts, and lower materials revenue, partially offset by revenues derived under our PEO Soldier and CNOSS programs and, to a lesser extent, from new awards in the past year.  
   Cost of revenue      Cost of revenue decreased 1.7% or
$3.6 million from $207.8 million to $204.2 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily the result of reduced subcontractor, materials, and software costs,
partially offset by an increase in direct labor costs. Cost of revenue represented 83.2% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 83.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was
primarily the result of the greater contribution of direct labor and more efficient absorption of indirect costs.      General and administrative
expenses      General and administrative expenses decreased 2.8%, or $0.6 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to
the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower indirect labor costs, more efficient allocation of business development expenses, lower executive compensation costs, and decreased stock compensation expense, partially offset by
an increase in external strategic consulting costs.      Depreciation and amortization    
 Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $5.2 and $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015 and due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated within the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Interest expense, net      Interest expense, net, was
approximately $0.5 million and $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributed to a lower weighted average loan balance.

    Provision for income taxes    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for income taxes increased to $6.2 million from $5.8 million in the same period a year ago,
due to increased pretax income on an lower effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 38.7% as compared to an effective income tax rate of 40.3% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The lower effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the result of a decrease in the blended state income tax rate from our current state revenue allocation, and partially due to a
discrete item in the quarter related to a corporate tax structure reorganization.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and making selective strategic acquisitions.
Historically, we have relied primarily on our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to provide the capital for our liquidity needs. As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions that could require us to
incur additional debt or issue new equity. We expect the combination of our current cash, cash flow from operations, and the available borrowing capacity under our credit facility to continue to meet our normal working capital, capital expenditures
and other cash requirements.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the balance of accounts receivable decreased by $6.7 million to $53.3
million at the end of the quarter. Days sales outstanding of accounts receivable ( DSO ) decreased 4 days to 62 days at September 30, 2016 as compared to 66 days at December 31, 2015. The decrease in DSO was mostly attributable
to the payment of invoices related to certain contracts where payment had been delayed in prior periods. As of September 30, 2016, no debt was outstanding and due under the credit facility, as compared to $10.0 million outstanding as of
December 31, 2015, reflecting $10.0 million of net payments during the first nine months of 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.8 million at September 30, 2016 and was used to pay down debt and meet working capital
requirements.    Our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our Class A common stock pursuant to a stock
repurchase program. If shares are repurchased, the shares will be repurchased pursuant to open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or block transactions. We have no obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization, and the
timing, actual number and value of the shares which are repurchased (and the manner of any such repurchase) will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, our Company s
cash needs, borrowing capacity under our credit facility, interest rates, and our financial performance and position. We may suspend or discontinue repurchases at any time.  
 During 2015 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not repurchase any shares. At September 30, 2016, we had $16.7 million
remaining under the board of directors  authorization for share repurchases.     Credit Facility : Our senior credit facility, amended in December
2014, and referred to herein as the  credit facility,  consists of a revolving line of credit with a borrowing capacity of up to an $80.0 million principal amount, and a $45.0 million accordion feature allowing us to increase our borrowing
capacity to up to a $125.0 million principal amount, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity from existing or new lenders. The outstanding borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the
Company s assets. The lenders also require a direct assignment of all contracts at the lenders  discretion. The outstanding balance under the credit facility accrues interest based on the one-month London Interbank offered rate or LIBOR,
plus an applicable margin, ranging from 210 to 310 basis points, based on the ratio of our outstanding senior funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization or EBITDA as defined in the credit facility.  
 The credit facility allows us to use borrowings thereunder of up to $17.5 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. Funds borrowed under the credit
facility may also be used to finance possible future acquisitions, for working capital requirements, for stock repurchases, for cash dividends or for general corporate uses.  
 The loan interest accrual rate is set monthly at one-month LIBOR plus a set amount per the credit facility.  
 The credit facility contains various restrictive covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to incur or guarantee additional debt; make certain
distributions, investments and other restricted payments such as dividends; enter into transactions with certain affiliates; create or permit certain liens; and consolidate, merge, or sell assets. In addition, the credit facility contains certain
financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth; maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio; maintain a minimum funded debt to earnings ratio; and limit capital expenditures below certain thresholds. There are no
restrictions on our retained earnings in the credit facility.    We are actively engaged with our bank group regarding our credit facility before the
current facility expires in January 2017. We anticipate the new facility will be larger and with similar or better terms and conditions as our current facility. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all our loan covenants.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.  
  Critical Accounting Policies     There have been no
significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies during the third quarter of 2016. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.  
     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
 The Company s exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under its credit facility. For the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, a change of one percentage point in interest rates would have changed the Company s interest expense or cash flows by less than $0.1 million. This estimate is based on our average balances for the period.  
 Additionally, the Company is subject to credit risks associated with our cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company believes that the
concentration of credit risk with respect to cash equivalents is limited due to the high credit quality of these investments. The Company s investment policy requires that the Company invest excess cash in high-quality investments, which
preserve principal, provide liquidity, and minimize investment risk. The Company also believes that its credit risk associated with accounts receivable is limited as they are primarily with the U.S. Federal Government or prime contractors working
for the U.S. Federal Government.        Item 4. Controls and Procedures    
   Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 As of September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of NCI s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, the Company had evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation,
NCI s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of September 30, 2016, such that the information that is required to be disclosed in
NCI s reports filed with the SEC (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including NCI s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting      The Company made no change to its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
as a result of the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial
reporting.
