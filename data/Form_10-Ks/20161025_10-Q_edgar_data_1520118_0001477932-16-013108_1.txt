      Table of Contents                EMS FIND, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES     NOTES  TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Organization      EMS Find, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "our," or "EMS Find") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 22, 2011, under the name of Lightcollar, Inc. On March 20, 2015, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name from Lightcollar, Inc. to EMS Find, Inc.     On December 23, 2014, the Company authorized a forward split (the "Forward Split") of its issued and authorized common shares, whereby every one (1) old share of common stock was exchanged for five (5) new shares of the Company's common stock. As a result, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock was increased from five million six hundred fifty thousand (5,650,000) common shares prior to the Forward Split to twenty-eight million two hundred fifty thousand (28,250,000) common shares following the Forward Split. Fractional shares were rounded upward.     On March 10, 2015, the Company, with the approval of a majority vote of its shareholders filed a Certificate of Designation establishing the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Company's Series A preferred stock (the "Series A Designation" and the "Series A Preferred Stock"). The terms of the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock, which was filed with the State of Nevada on March 12, 2015, include the right to vote in aggregate, on all shareholder matters equal to 1,000 votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock shares are not convertible into shares of our common stock.     Effective March 20, 2015, the Company, with the approval of its board of directors and its majority shareholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting, filed a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment") with the Secretary of State of Nevada. As a result of the Certificate of Amendment, the Company, among other things, (i) changed its name to "EMS Find, Inc.," and (ii) changed its symbol to "EMSF."     On March 23, 2015, the Company issued 50,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in consideration for services on the Company's Board of Directors.     On March 31, 2015, the Company issued 450,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in consideration for services on the Company's Board of Directors.     On March 31, 2015, the Company signed the share exchange agreement with EMS Factory, Inc. ("EMS Factory"), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and the shareholder of EMS Factory (the "Selling Shareholder") pursuant to a share exchange agreement by and among the Company, EMS Factory and the Selling Shareholder. The Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of EMS Factory in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share and 500,000 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001. The Company also has an agreement with an investor to fund $300,000 over the next one hundred and twenty days, to support the continued development and commercialization of EMS Factory's technology, in the following manner:     As a result of the Agreement the Selling Shareholder acquired up to 49% of the voting rights of Company's currently issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Upon completion of the agreement, EMS Factory became a wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company acquired the business and operations of EMS factory. Further, on the Closing date of the Agreement, Steve Rubakh, was appointed the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and a Director of the Company, and Mr. Matveev Anton resigned all of his positions with the Company.      Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of EMS Find, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, EMS Factory, Inc. and Viva Entertainment, have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. The results of operations for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company's management, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed on September 27, 2016 and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For accounting purposes and due to the accounting for the reverse merger, the Company is using the accounting year end of EMS Factory, Inc., for the presentation in this filing.                  7       
      Table of Contents           EMS FIND, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       Nature of Business      The Company transitioned its operations from acting as a licensed ambulance provider to providing medical transportation information and acting as an intermediary coordinating dispatch services for providers, patients and medical transport companies. The Company is designing, developing, marketing, and operating software assets mainly in on-demand mobile healthcare sector.      Principles of Consolidation      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EMS Find and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, EMS Factory and Viva Entertainment. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      The Company maintains cash balances in non-interest-bearing accounts that currently do not exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company had cash balances of $11,269 and $1,974 as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 respectively.      Property and Equipment      Property and equipment consists of ambulances and medical equipment and are stated at cost. Ambulance and medical equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated service life of five years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are recorded upon disposal.      Accounting for Derivatives      The Company evaluates its convertible debt, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under this accounting standard are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.      Impairment of Long-Lived Assets      The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 360-10, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.      Stock-Based Compensation      The Company accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition provisions ASC Topic 505-50. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.                  8       
      Table of Contents           EMS FIND, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       Revenue Recognition      Our revenue is derived from the service revenue from ambulance transportation services.     The Company's revenue recognition policy is in accordance with the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, Revenue Recognition ("SAB 104"), and other applicable revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP. Sales revenue is recognized for our retail and wholesale customers when: (i) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, (ii) the sales terms are fixed or determinable, (iii) title and risk of loss have transferred, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured   generally when products are shipped to the customer and services are rendered, except in situations in which title passes upon receipt of the products by the customer. In this case, revenues are recognized upon services rendered.      Income Taxes      The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.  When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of June 30, 2016, tax year 2015 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from the IRS for any of the open tax years.     The Company adopted ASC 740-10,  Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48,  ( ASC 740-10 ), which was issued on May 2, 2007. ASC 740-10 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term  effectively settled  replaces the term  ultimately settled  when used to describe recognition, and the terms  settlement  or  settled  replace the terms  ultimate settlement  or  ultimately settled  when used to describe measurement of a tax position under ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The adoption of ASC 740-10 did not have an impact on the accompanying financial statements.      Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share      In accordance with ASC 260-10, "Earnings Per Share," basic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common stock equivalent shares which may dilute future earnings per share consist of convertible notes convertible into 928,402 common shares. Equivalent shares are not utilized when the effect is anti-dilutive (see Note 4).      Recent Pronouncements      On November 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-16 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this Update do not change the current criteria in GAAP for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods.                 9       
      Table of Contents            EMS FIND, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)      On November 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-17 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this Update provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18, 2014. After the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle.     In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern. The new standard requires management of public and private companies to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, disclose that fact. Management will also be required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The standard requires management to evaluate, for each reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The new standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.      NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN      The Company has not generated any revenues, has recurring net losses, a working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2016 of $937,224, and used cash in operations of $90,371 and $204,375 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,346,234. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on the execution of management's plans, which include the raising of capital through the debt and/or equity markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.     There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating additional cash from the equity/debt markets or other sources to be used for operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary. Based on the Company's current resources, the Company will not be able to continue to operate without additional immediate funding. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary.      NOTE 3   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT       Assets held for Sale            Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $47, respectively. After the merger in March 2015, the Company discontinued all of its ambulance services. The Company wrote down $8,200 as of June 30, 2015 for its assets held for sale and took a loss of $13,097 on a sale of three of its vehicles it used for its medical transportation business. On March 28, 2016, the Company sold various assets valued at $35,521, net of accumulated depreciation, for $23,422. With the fees associated with the sale, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of $22,855.      NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      In April 2015, the Company entered a month-to-month lease agreement for an office space for $1,250 per month owned by a relative of Steve Rubakh ( Rubakh ), an officer and director of the Company. The lease was terminated on August 30, 2015.             EMS FIND, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)      On August 5, 2015, Shang Fei resigned from the Company as a board member and surrendered his 500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock which the company had issued to him in March 2015. Mr. Shang Fei also has provided the Company with $260,000 of capital of which $210,000 and a prior loan for expenses of $19,095 was converted into 212,050 shares of common stock.     On September 25, 2015, the Company authorized the issuance of 125,000 shares of common stock as part of an agreement with Daniel Grillo ( Grillo ), a director of the Company, for services from September 25, 2015 through March 31, 2016.

( Viva Entertainment ) to Black River Petroleum Corp., a Nevada publicly-traded company ( Black River ), at a closing where, in exchange for all sale of all of the outstanding shares of Viva Entertainment, Black River issued to the Company its 10% promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000, due September 30, 2016. In connection with the sale, Viva Entertainment s Chief Executive Officer, Johnny Falcones ( Falcones ), a member of our Board of Directors, resigned from all positions at our Company and was elected as the sole director and President and Chief Executive Officer of Black River, to manage the development and marketing of Viva Entertainment s over the top (IPTV/OTT) application for connected TV s, desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones.     Financial Operations Overview      Revenue      To date, we have not generated any revenues from product sales and expect to start bring in revenue toward the end of the 2016 calendar year. Revenues to date have been generated substantially from the now discontinued Ambulance services. Since our inception through June 30, 2016, we have generated approximately $1.1 million in revenue. We have since discontinued these services and are focusing on new revenue sources.            We are incurring increased costs as a result of being a publicly-traded company. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies and will require us to comply with these rules. These new rules and regulations have will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, these new rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which we currently cannot afford to do. As a result of the new rules, it may become more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of being a public company or the timing of such costs.     To fund future operations, we will need to raise additional capital. The amount and timing of future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and results of our ongoing development efforts, the potential expansion of our current development programs, potential new development programs and related general and administrative support. We anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements. We cannot be certain that anticipated additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015       Revenues      Our revenue was $0 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      General and Administrative Expenses      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our general and administrative expenses were $755,316 compared to $186,298 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in an increase of $569,018, primarily contributable to stock-based compensation of $43,950 offset by a reduction in executive compensation.      Net Loss      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $234,020 compared to a net loss of $235,402 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was partially contributable to beneficial conversion feature ("BCF") expense, $74,980, original issue discount ("OID"), $15,843, the loss on the conversion of debt into common stock, $115,274, offset by the change in the fair value of embedded conversion options, $733,774.        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS       Overview      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $11,269 in cash. We do not have sufficient resources to effectuate our business. We expect to incur a minimum of $50,000 in expenses during the next twelve months of operations. We estimate that these expenses will be comprised primarily of general expenses including overhead, legal and accounting fees.             Liquidity and Capital Resources during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015      We used cash in operations of $90,371 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash used in operations of $204,375 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The negative cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to the Company's net loss from operations of $234,020 primarily due to the issuance of common stock for services, $643,950, BCF expense, $74,980, and the loss on conversion of debt into common stock, $115,274, offset by the change in the fair value of embedded conversion options, $733,774. Cash used in operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is attributable to the Company's net loss of $235,402.     We used cash in investing or financing activities of $0 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     We had cash provided by financing activities of $99,666 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $247,600 for the same period in 2015.      We will have to raise funds to pay for our expenses. We may have to borrow money from shareholders or issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have no arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for our operations will have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain a viable company.        Going Concern      The Company has not generated any revenues, has recurring net losses, a working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2016 of $778,264, and used cash in operations of $90,371 and $204,375 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,393,777. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on the execution of management's plans, which include the raising of capital through the debt and/or equity markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.     There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating additional cash from the equity/debt markets or other sources to be used for operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary. Based on the Company's current resources, the Company will not be able to continue to operate without additional immediate funding. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary.      Estimated 2017 Capital Requirements      We estimate our capital requirements over the next twelve months for the development and marketing of our EMS on demand mobile platform app to be $1,000,000 to $3,000,000.     We have obtained working capital through various convertible note financings with various third parties.             USE OF ESTIMATES      The preparation of the financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to oil and gas properties, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in these financial statements. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.     Management believes that it is reasonably possible that the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could happen in the coming two years:        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements      We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.      Critical Accounting Policies      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions.     The Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued "Financial Reporting Release No. 60 Cautionary Advice About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggesting companies provide additional disclosures, discussion and commentary on their accounting policies considered most critical to its business and financial reporting requirements. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in the application of the policy.     The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to non-employees under ASC 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718"). The compensation cost of the awards is based on the grant date fair-value of these awards and recognized over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair-value of stock options issued for compensation.     The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards based upon ASC 505-50, "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees." ASC 505-50 requires the costs of goods and services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be recognized using the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity award, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of the equity award is determined on the measurement date, which is the earlier of the date that a performance commitment is reached or the date that performance is complete. Generally, our awards do not entail performance commitments. When an award vests over time such that performance occurs over multiple reporting periods, we estimate the fair value of the award as of the end of each reporting period and recognize an appropriate portion of the cost based on the fair value on that date. When the award vests, we adjust the cost previously recognized so that the cost ultimately recognized is equivalent to the fair value on the date the performance is complete. Dilutive common stock equivalent shares which may dilute future earnings per share consist of warrants to purchase 3,225,000 at September 30, 2016 shares of common stock and convertible notes convertible into approximately 15,990,474 common shares. Equivalent shares are not utilized when the effect is anti-dilutive.             NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES      Adjusted Net Earnings     In addition to reporting net loss from operations as defined under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), the Company presents adjusted net earnings from operations (adjusted net earnings), which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Adjusted net earnings consist of net loss from operations after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. Adjusted net earnings does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, GAAP measurements such as net loss from operations (its most comparable GAAP financial measure), and the Company s calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. By eliminating the items shown below, the Company believes that the measure is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies. The Company s management does not view adjusted net earnings in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as net loss from operation and revenues to measure operating performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented:            Adjusted EBITDA     In addition to reporting net loss from operations as defined under GAAP, the Company also presents adjusted net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization from operations (adjusted EBITDA), which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss from operations after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, GAAP measurements such as net loss from operations (its most comparable GAAP financial measure), and the Company s calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.            By eliminating the items shown below, the Company believes the measure is useful in evaluating its fundamental core operating performance. The Company also believes that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies. The Company s management uses adjusted EBITDA to manage its business, including in preparing its annual operating budget and financial projections. The Company s management does not view adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as net loss from operations and revenues to measure operating performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:              ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.      A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.       ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term "disclosure controls and procedures" to mean a company's controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its chief executive and chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive and interim chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.             As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of such date. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that the Company continues to have the following deficiencies which represent a material weakness:                  1.    The Company intends to appoint additional independent directors;           2.    Lack of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions;           3.    Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting;           4.    Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.         To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures:                         The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint additional member(s) to the Audit Committee.                  The Company will add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.                  The Company will hire staff technically proficient at applying U.S. GAAP to financial transactions and reporting.                  Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures.         The additional hiring is contingent upon The Company's efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt and the results of its operations. Management expects to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      Except as set forth above, due to the new business plan, we are in the process of finalizing our controls over the new business process.      Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls      The Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.              PART II    OTHER INFORMATION        ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.      There are no pending legal proceedings in which we are a party or in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, any owner of record or beneficiary of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities is a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us. Our property is not the subject of any pending legal proceedings.       ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.      On July 1, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company agreed with Rubakh to convert $6,000 of accrued compensation into 300,000 shares of common stock, at a conversion rate of $0.02 per share.      On August 29, 2016, Global converted $5,000 ($4,500 principal and legal fees of $500) of its note dated August 10, 2016, into 250,000 shares, converted at a rate of $0.02 per share.     On September 2, 2016, Global converted $10,000 ($9,500 principal and legal fees of $500) of its note dated August 10, 2016, into 500,000 shares, converted at a rate of $0.02 per share.     On September 13, 2016, Global converted $8,500 ($8,000 principal and legal fees of $500) of its note dated August 10, 2016, into 680,000 shares, converted at a rate of $0.0125 per share.     On September 26, 2016, Global converted $8,500 ($8,000 principal and legal fees of $500) of its note dated August 10, 2016, into 1,202,677 shares, converted at a rate of $0.0071 per share.     On October 7, 2016, Global converted $6,000 ($5,500 principal and legal fees of $500) of its note dated August 10, 2016, into 1,000,000 shares, converted at a rate of $0.006 per share.     For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company authorized the issuance of 60,000 shares of Series B preferred stock as part of Rubakh's compensation package.        ITEM 3.
