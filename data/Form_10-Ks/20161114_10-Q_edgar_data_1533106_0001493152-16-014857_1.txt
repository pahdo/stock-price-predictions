Note
1 - Basis of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures necessary for a comprehensive
presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management s opinion, however, that all
material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements
presentation.  

The
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Management s Discussion and Analysis,
for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interim results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of results for the full fiscal year.  

Note
2 - Nature of Operations    

Global
Equity Partners, Plc. ( GEP ), a private company, was organized under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles on September
2, 2009. Global Equity International Inc. (the  Company  or  GEI ), a reporting company since June 21,
2012, was organized under the laws of the state of Nevada on October 1, 2010. On November 15, 2010, GEP executed a reverse recapitalization
with GEI. On August 22, 2014, we formed a Dubai subsidiary of GEP called GE Professionals DMCC. GEP is the parent company of its
100% subsidiary GE Professionals DMCC (Dubai). On June 10, 2016, GEI incorporated its wholly owned subsidiary, called GEP Equity
Holdings Limited, under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles.  

Revenue
is generated from business consulting services and employment placements.  

Note
3 - Going Concern    

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net (loss) / income of $(65,130) and $261,808
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively, net cash used by operations of $251,661 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016; and a working capital deficit of $1,625,662 and stockholders  equity of $1,471,605 as of September
30, 2016. Some of these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability for the Company to continue its operations is primarily dependent on:  

a)  
      Continually
    engaging with new clients which over the years have become consistent.   

b)  
      Consummating
    and executing current engagements.    

Whilst
the Company s current engagements are being consummated and executed, the Company may also have to resort to borrowing additional
funds with certain related parties, such as management, and also third party funders on a non-discounted basis (if for shares,
on a fixed price basis) to sustain the Company s existence. In addition, in the event that operating cash flows are slowed,
the Company would reduce its overheads wherever possible and any monies owed to the management can also be forgiven, if necessary.

   Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements   

    September
30, 2016    

    (Unaudited)    

The
Company s deferred revenue, $225,000 at September 30, 2016, is non-refundable hence once certain contractual milestones
are achieved or contractual terms pass over time, as applicable, on each individual engagement a proportion of deferred revenue
will become revenue for the Company and therefore no cash outlays are required for these liabilities.  

It
is important to note that the two largest debts (The Able Foundation loan   Eden loan) stated on our current liabilities are
non-collateralized and non-convertible loans. However, Able Foundation has a judgment against the Company which is currently under
appeal (See Note 10).  

Note
4 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Principles
of Consolidation   

Global
Equity International Inc. is the parent company of its two 100% subsidiaries called Global Equity Partners Plc. and GEP Equity
Holdings Limited. Global Equity Partners Plc. is the parent company of its 100% subsidiary, GE Professionals DMCC (Dubai). All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period.  

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition, situation, or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered
in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future non-confirming events. Accordingly, the actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include allowance for
doubtful accounts and loans receivable, estimates of fair value of securities received for services, estimates of fair value of
securities held, depreciation of fixed assets, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, derivative valuations, and equity valuations
for non-cash equity grants.  

Risks
and Uncertainties   

The
Company s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, competition and
potential risk of business failure. The Company s headquarters are based in Dubai.  

Cash

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September
30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015, respectively; the Company had no cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

The
Company recognizes accounts receivable in connection with the services provided. The Company recognizes an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on an analysis of current receivables aging and expected future write-offs, as well as an assessment of specific
identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible.  

Foreign
Currency Policy   

The
Company s accounting policies related to the consolidation and accounting for foreign operations are as follows: The accompanying
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company s Dubai subsidiary
is the Arab Emirates Dirham (AED). All foreign currency balances and transactions are translated into United States dollars  $ 
and/or  USD  as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period.
Equity transactions are translated using spot rate prevailing at each historical transaction date. Translation adjustments arising
from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of our stockholders  equity (deficit)
as  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Since the AED is tagged to the U.S. dollar, translation gains
and losses are always de minimis. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statement
of operations.  

Investments   

(A)
Classification of Securities   

Marketable
Securities    

At
the time of the acquisition, a marketable security is designated as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, which depends
on the ability and intent to hold such security to maturity. Securities classified as trading and available-for-sale are reported
at fair value, while securities classified as held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost.  

Any
unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains (losses) are computed
on a specific identification basis and are reflected in the statement of operations.  

Cost
Method Investments    

Securities
that are not classified as marketable securities are accounted for under the cost method. These securities are recorded at their
original cost basis and are subject to impairment testing.  

(B)
Other than Temporary Impairment    

The
Company reviews its equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require
the recognition of an impairment loss in income statement. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates,
among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and the Company s
intent and ability to hold the investments. Management also considers the type of security, related-industry and sector performance,
as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports, to evaluate its portfolio. Once a decline in fair value is determined
to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market,
industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, the Company may incur future impairments. The Company did not record any permanent
impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

Fixed
Assets   

Fixed
assets are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided based on estimated useful lives
of the assets. Cost of improvements that substantially extend the useful lives of assets can be capitalized. Repairs and maintenance
expenses are to be charged to expense when incurred. In case of sale or disposal of an asset, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the consolidated financial statements.  

Beneficial
Conversion Feature   

For
conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records any  beneficial conversion
feature  ( BCF ) intrinsic value as additional paid in capital and related debt discount.  

When
the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective
debt instrument. The discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate
share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.  

Debt
Issue Costs   

The
Company may pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not. These
costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization
of debt discount.  

Original
Issue Discount   

If
debt is issued with an original issue discount, the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount, reducing the face amount
of the note and is amortized over the life of the debt to income statement as amortization of debt discount. If a conversion of
the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.  

Valuation
of Derivative Instruments   

ASC
815  Derivatives and Hedging  requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with
free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting
purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. At September 30,
2015, the Company adjusted its derivative liability to its fair value, and reflected the change in fair value, in its consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss as gain (loss) on derivatives. Upon conversion of a note where the embedded conversion
option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company records the shares at fair value and relieves
all related notes, derivatives and debt discounts and a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment is recorded.

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize revenue from the services we provide in accordance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition . ASC Topic 605 sets
forth guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned, which is generally, when all of the following criteria
are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been performed; (3) the
seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, the contract
terms for these services are relatively short in duration.  

We
receive consideration in the form of cash and/or securities.  

We
recognize cash consideration as revenues as the services are performed either on a pro rata basis or on a milestone basis.  

Securities
received as consideration are often earned at a point in time when the specified event occurs and the securities are issued to
us. Therefore, we measure and recognize these securities received at fair value on the date of receipt. If securities are received
in advance of completion of our services, the fair value will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as the
services are completed.  

All
revenues are generated from clients whose operations are based outside of the United States.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had the following concentrations of accounts receivable with customers:

Deferred
Revenue   

Deferred
revenue represents fees that have been received by the Company for requested services that have not been completed. Following
table illustrates the movement in deferred revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Share-based
Payments   

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments to employees, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock
grants at their fair value on the grant date, which is based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to
vest.  

Share
based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered
or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable as of the measurement date. Amounts received
prior to the measurement date are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period until a measurement date is achieved. The grants
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period.  

Share
based payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model.   

When
computing fair value, the Company considered the following variables:  

The
    risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the
    share based payment in effect at the time of the grant.    

The
    expected term is developed by management estimate.   

The
    Company has not paid any dividends on common stock since inception and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common
    stock in the near future.   

The
    expected volatility is based on management estimates which are based upon our historical volatility.   

The
    forfeiture rate is based on historical experience.   

Earnings
per Share   

The basic net earnings (loss) per share are
computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted
net earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. 

As at September 30, 2016, the Company had
a common stock equivalent in the form of a fixed price convertible note, which, if exercisable, would be dilutive. See Note 7(D) 

The Following table reconciles the dilutive
weighted average number of shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Fair
Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities   

The
Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance
on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability,
as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  

The
authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring
or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical
levels of inputs to measure fair value:  

Level
    1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level
    2: Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar
    assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities;
    or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

Level
    3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair
    value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.   

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accounts payable to
related parties and loans payable to related parties, approximate fair value based on the short-term nature of these instruments.  

The
Company measures its derivative liabilities at fair market value on a recurring basis and measures its non-marketable securities
at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Consequently, the Company may have gains and losses reported in the statement of operations.  

The
following is the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable
inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

The
following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure financial instruments at fair value:  

Marketable
Securities    The Level 2 position consists of the Company s investment in equity securities of stock held in publicly
traded companies. The valuation of these securities is based on significant inputs that are observable or can be derived from
or corroborated by observable market data. These valuations are typically based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company s
investments in equity securities are in relatively inactive markets.  

Non-Marketable
Securities at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis    Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
The level 3 position consist of investments accounted for under the cost method. The Level 3 position consists of investments
in equity securities held in private companies.  

Management
believes that an  other-than-temporary impairment  would be justified, as according to ASC 320-10 an investment is
considered impaired when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The impairment is considered either
temporary or other-than-temporary. The accounting literature does not define other-than-temporary. It does, however, state that
other-than-temporary does not mean permanent, although, all permanent impairments are considered other-than-temporary. The literature
does provide some examples of factors, which may be indicative of an  other-than-temporary impairment , such as:  

the
    length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost;   

the
    financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and   

the
    intent and ability of the holder to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
    recovery in market value.   

Management
believes that the fair value of its investment has been correctly measured, as the length of time that the stock has been less
than cost is nominal.  

Changes
in Level 3 assets measured at fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

Reclassification   

Certain
amounts in the December 31, 2015 balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. Accrued
liabilities amounting to $184,656 were previously included in the accounts payable.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

There
are no new accounting pronouncements that have any impact on the Company s financial statements other than discussed below:  

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,  Principal versus
Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   which makes targeted improvements to clarify the principal
versus agent assessment and are intended to make the guidance more operable and lead to more consistent application. The amendments,
however, do not eliminate the significant judgments related to principal versus agent assessments. This guidance is effective
for calendar year-end in 2018 for interim and annual reporting periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance
will have on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In
May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606)  : Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which provides clarifying guidance
in certain narrow areas and added some practical expedients. The standard and related amendments will be effective for financial
statements issued by public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
of the standard is permitted, but not before the original date of financial statements issued by public companies for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We currently do not plan to early adopt this guidance and are
evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements as well as transition methods.

On
    August 25, 2016, the Company secured a six month non-convertible loan for $167,500 carrying an original issue discount of

Fixed Price Convertible Note Payable   

On
    August 27, 2015, the Company secured a six month non-convertible loan for $135,000 carrying an original issue discount of
    $30,000. In addition, the company agreed to pay $5,000 to the note holder to cover their legal costs and the interest will

On
March 18, 2016, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with the same lender whereby original purchase agreement dated
August 27, 2015 was exchanged with the new agreement to extend the loan repayment term until April 17, 2016. The total exchange
price for $135,000 of principal of the Old Note was as follows:  

$135,000 principal of New Note, and  

an issuance of 1,000,000 common shares to the lender as exchange shares.   

Also,
in the new note, there was an addition of a conversion option that the lender has right at any time after the exchange date until
the outstanding balance has been paid in full, to convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into common shares of the
Company at a fixed conversion price of $0.025. There was no beneficial conversion feature as the conversion price was higher than
the current market value of the Company s stock at that time. Since a conversion option was added to the note in the March
18, 2016 modification, this modification was accounted for as a debt extinguishment on that date and $25,200 was recognized as
loss on debt extinguishment based on the quoted trading price of $0.0252 per share.

On
April 28, 2016, St. George decided not to opt for converting the principal loan to common shares. Instead, on April 28, 2016,
the Company renegotiated the loan terms, further extending the repayment to July 1, 2016. The terms of this further extension
were a one-time 10% interest payment of $13,500 to be added to the principal of $135,000 and the issuance of 3,000,000 common
shares. The Company accounted for this further extension as a debt extinguishment of previous extension dated March 18, 2016 and
$58,200 was recognized as loss on debt extinguishment comprising of $13,500 of interest payment and $44,700 for issuance of 3,000,000
common shares of the Company valued at the quoted trading price of $0.0149 per share on the date of new exchange. (See Note 8
(b))  

On
July 1, 2016, after receipt of $148,500 from Mammoth Corporation (New Lender), St. George (Previous Lender) assigned and transferred
to the Mammoth Corporation all of its rights, title and interest in and to the promissory note initially issued by the Company
to St. George Investments LLC in the amount of $148,500 dated April 28, 2016. The Company re-negotiated the loan terms with new
lender (Mammoth Corporation) after the above assignment and issued a restated 9 months convertible promissory note amounting to
$163,350 dated July 01, 2016. The terms of this exchanged note were a one-time 10% increase in the principal loan of $14,850,
making the principal sum from $148,500 to $163,350. The new lender also has a right, at any time after the issue date of revised
note until the outstanding balance has been paid in full, to convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into common shares
of the Company at a fixed conversion price of $0.017. Fair value of the Company s stock as on the date of exchange was $0.0197.
This indicated a beneficial conversion feature (BCF) of the Note as the conversion price is lower than the fair value of the Company s
stock as on July 01, 2016. The Company accounted for the difference arising due to BCF amounting to $25,944 as a debt discount
with a corresponding effect to additional paid in capital. Interest on unpaid principal balance shall not accrue during the term
of the note unless an event of default occurs. The Company accounted for this exchange as a debt extinguishment of previous note
dated April 28, 2016 and $14,850 was further recognized as loss on debt extinguishment.  

On
September 16, 2016, the note holder decided to convert partial note balance amounting to $59,500 to the common shares of the Company
at the contractual fixed price of $0.017 per share. As a result of this conversion, the Company issued 3,500,000 common shares
to Mammoth Corporation.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company amortized $14,948 of debt discount balance arising due to BCF, leaving un-amortized
debt discount balance of $10,996 as of September 30, 2016. The outstanding convertible note balance amounted to $103,850 as of
September 30, 2016.

plaintiff, the Able Foundation, is requesting a settlement of $411,272, which is the $226,616 currently owed, and an additional
$184,656 accrued in 2015 as a provision for potential damages (see Note 7(C)).  

On,
June 1, 2015, the Company (the defendant) retained the legal services of a Dubai based law firm called Al Safar   Partners.
Currently, there is a judgment against the Company (the defendant) for the recovery of $411,272.  

The
Company s Dubai lawyers, Al Safar   Partners, have subsequently appealed this judgment based on the fact that they believe
from a legal stand point that:  

1)  
      the
    Company (the defendant) has not been heard, which is a violation of the fundamental principle of law  Audi Alteram Partem .   

2)  
      there
    is no legal existence of Global Equity Partners Plc. in Dubai as it is a Republic of Seychelles corporation; hence the Courts
    of Dubai have no jurisdiction in the matter.   

According
to the Dubai lawyers, the judgment issued against the Company (the defendant) by the Dubai First Instance Court bears no legality
and void therefore the Plaintiff s claim should be rejected in its entirety.  

These
legal proceedings and appeal are currently ongoing. The Company intends to vigorously defend the litigation. At September 30,
2016, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.  

On
    October 7, 2015, the Company renewed its rent agreement for its head office in Dubai for a further period of two years. The
    rental amount was agreed at $31,850 per annum for the first year (from November 2015 until October 2016) and $35,035 for the
    second year (from November 2016 until October 2017). This rental agreement is renewable for a further one year and if renewed
    the annual rent will suffer a 5% increase.   

On
    September 30, 2016, the Board of Directors agreed to discontinue compensating the Company s CEO for his personal rent
    allowance in Dubai.

                                         overview:      

Global
Equity International Inc. ( Company  or  GEI ) was incorporated on October 1, 2010, as a Nevada corporation,
for the express purpose of acquiring Global Equity Partners Plc., a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles
( GEP ) on September 2, 2009. On August 22, 2014, GE Professionals DMCC was incorporated in Dubai as a fully owned
subsidiary of Global Equity Partners Plc.  

On
June 10, 2016, GEI incorporated its wholly owned subsidiary, called GEP Equity Holdings Limited, under the laws of the Republic
of Seychelles.  

Global
Equity Partners Plc. and its subsidiary, GE Professionals DMCC, are Dubai based firms that provide consulting services, such as
corporate restructuring, management recruitment and development for corporate marketing, investor and public relations, regulatory
compliance and introductions to financiers, to companies desiring to be listed on a Public Stock Exchanges in various parts of
the world.  

Our
authorized capital consists of 950,000,000 shares of common stock having a par value of $0.001 per share and 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock having a par value of $0.001.  

On
July 15, 2015 the designation of the 5,000,000 Series  A  convertible preferred stock was withdrawn.  

The
Company had revenues amounting to $306,962 and $1,130,465, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
total revenue decreased by $823,503 due the fact that we received $675,450 in equity securities in a private company in exchange
for services performed during the comparative three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30,
2016, we didn t receive any such equity securities which resulted in a decrease in revenues when compared to three months
ended September 30, 2015. Following is the breakdown of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 which amounted
to $306,962:  

a)  
      $252,500
    was recognized as revenue from deferred revenue as we performed related services to the clients against payments received
    in prior quarters.   

b)  
      $29,462
    was recognized as revenue for services already rendered to a client and payment from client was pending as at September 30,
    2016.   

c)  
      $25,000
    was received in cash for services performed to a couple of clients during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had the following concentrations of revenues with customers:  

The
total operating expenditures amounted to $317,897 and $444,577, for the three months ending on September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The following table sets forth the Company s operating expenditure analysis for both periods:  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were reduced by $126,680 from the previous three months ending
on September 30, 2015. The reason for this decrease is mainly due to the decrease in general   administrative expenses, salaries
and professional services during the current three months ending on September 30, 2016.  

The
(loss) / income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(10,935) and $685,888, respectively.  

The
Company s other income and (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $(54,195) and $(453,163),
respectively. The following table sets forth the Company s other income and (expenses) analysis for both periods:  

Our
total other expenses were reduced substantially due to the fact that the Company settled all of its discounted convertible debts
last year. The settlement of this debt last year resulted large amounts of interest expense, loss on derivative liabilities, loss
on conversion of notes into stock and amortization of debt discount during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
net (loss) / income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(65,130) and $232,725, respectively.  

The Company had 809,499,228 and 771,523,183
common shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Basic and diluted weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was 795,548,582 and
551,531,231, respectively. Basic and diluted net (loss) / income per share for both periods was $(0.00) and $0.00, respectively. 

The
Company had revenues amounting to $1,412,213 and $2,285,965, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Following
is the breakdown of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which amounted to $1,412,213:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had the following concentrations of revenues with customers:  

The
total operating expenditures amounted to $995,161 and $1,284,654, for the nine months ending on September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The following table sets forth the Company s operating expenditure analysis for both periods:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were reduced by $289,493 from the previous nine months ending
on September 30, 2015. The reason for this decrease is mainly due to a general reduction of General and Administrative expenses,
salaries, and professional services during the nine months ending on September 30, 2016.  

Income
from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $417,052 and $1,001,311, respectively.  

The
Company s other income and (expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $(155,244) and $(1,191,600),
respectively. The following table sets forth the Company s other income and (expenses) analysis for both periods:  

Our
total other expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were reduced substantially due to the fact that the Company
settled all of its discounted convertible debts last year. The settlement of this debt last year resulted in large amounts of
interest expense, loss on derivative liabilities, loss on conversion of notes into stock and amortization of debt discount during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Loss on extinguishment of debt and other liabilities includes a loss of $83,400 arising
due to double exchange of a loan note with the same lender during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
net income / (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $261,808 and $(190,289), respectively.  

The Company had 809,499,228 and 771,523,183
common shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Basic weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 784,687,141 and 238,222,071,
respectively. Basic net income / (loss) per share for both periods was $0.00 and $(0.00), respectively. Dilutive weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was 790,795,964 and 238,222,071,
respectively. Dilutive net income / (loss) per share for both periods was $0.00 and $(0.00), respectively. 

Assets:    

The
Company reported total assets of $3,215,881 and $2,807,095 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These
mainly include our investment in securities of our clients that we received as part of our consulting fees. At December 31, 2015,
we had long term investments amounting to $2,650,471. These long term investments amount to $3,085,322 as of September 30, 2016
representing an increase of 16%. Our fixed assets include office equipment having a net book value of $11,945 and $20,081 as at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Furthermore, our current assets at December 31, 2015 totaled $136,543
and at September 30, 2016, these current assets amounted to $118,614 comprising cash of $15,051, accounts receivable of $51,962
and prepaid and other current assets of $51,601.  

Liabilities:    

Our
current liabilities at December 31, 2015 totaled $2,283,652. Over the last nine months, we managed to decrease these current liabilities
to $1,744,276 which represents a decrease of 24%. All of our liabilities are current and mainly include third party debt which
is due to four lenders, payable to related parties and our day to day operational creditors.  

Following
is the summary of all third party notes, net of debt discount, including the accrued interest as at September 30, 2016:  

*
Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the April 29, 2016 note having a principal amount of $135,000 was fully repaid
in cash on October 12, 2016.   

Also,
out of the cash fees received from different clients to date, the Company has deferred a total $225,000 from cash fees received
from three clients. These deferred cash fees will be reflected on the Company s income statement once certain milestones
and contractual agreements have been completed.  

Stockholder s
Equity:    

At
December 31, 2015, the Company had stockholders  equity of $523,443. At September 30, 2016, the Company had stockholders 
equity of $1,471,605, which represents an increase of 181%.  

The
Company had 809,499,228 and 776,165,973 common shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

E.        Liquidity
                                         and Capital reserves:      

Our
consolidated financial statements contained herein have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The Company had (loss) / income from operations of $(10,935) and $417,052 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively; a total other expenses amounting to $54,195 and $155,244 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively; and a net (loss) / income of $(65,130) and $261,808 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively,.  

The
Company had $15,051 in cash; net cash used in operations of $251,661 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016; working capital
deficit of $1,625,662 and stockholders  equity of $1,471,605 as of September 30, 2016.  

The
ability of the Company to continue its operations is primarily dependent on:  

a)
      
      Continually
    engaging with new clients, which over the years have become consistent.   

b)  
      Consummating
    and executing current engagements.    

While
the Company s current engagements are being consummated and executed, the Company may also resort to borrowing additional
funds from certain related parties, such as management, and also third party funders some of which may be on a fixed price conversion
basis to sustain the Company s existence. In addition, in the event that operating cash flows are slowed, the Company would
reduce its overhead wherever possible and any monies owed to the management can also be forgiven, if necessary. Such measures
were taken on September 30, 2016 when the Company s Board of Directors agreed to discontinue compensating the Company s
CEO for his personal rent allowance in Dubai.  

It
is the Company s intention to expand its operations via the acquisition of companies that are in a similar space and industry
as ours, and to date we have identified various companies that we would consider acquiring. However, we do not have any verbal
or written agreements with anyone to provide us with debt financing.  

Any
short fall in our projected operating revenues will be covered by:  

The
    cash retainer fees and cash success fees that we expect to receive during the next 12 months from the clients we currently
    have under contract.   

Receiving
    loans from one or more of our officers even though at the present time, we do not have verbal or written commitments from
    any of our officers to lend us money.   

Receiving
    loans from third party lenders and/ or investors.   

The
Company s deferred revenue, $225,000 at September 30, 2016, is non-refundable hence once certain contractual milestones
are achieved or contractual terms pass over time, as applicable, on each individual engagement a proportion of deferred revenue
will become revenue for the Company and therefore no cash outlays are required for these liabilities.  

It
is important to note that the two largest debts (The Able Foundation loan   Eden loan) stated on our current liabilities are
non-collateralized and non-convertible loans this meaning that the Company has not given any form of guarantee to the lenders
nor can the loans become convertible into common shares at any point in time.  

The
Company believes that it will receive certain contractually agreed cash success fees in the near future and also it is the Company s
intent to commence to liquidate certain investments on or before the year ended December 31, 2016 or early Q1 2017, these cash
injections should provide sufficient cash flow to allow the Company to commence to pay off the third party debt and also allow
the Company sufficient cash flow to continue to grow and expand in 2017 without having to resort to third party or affiliate loans.
However, we cannot guarantee that such a cash injection will be readily available in a timely manner.  

It
is important to point out that for the purpose of improving the Company s current and future liquidity position and also
to mitigate the short term liabilities, $524,665 of management s and certain employee s accrued salaries were converted
to common restricted stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The following table depicts the above mentioned conversions:  

Finally,
on November 11, 2016, the Company s CEO, CFO and Managing Director jointly decided to retire an aggregate of 450,000,000
of their personally owned Common Shares in exchange for 45,000,000 Series  B  Preferred shares. As a result of this
retirement and exchange, the Company s issued and outstanding Common Shares were drastically reduced from 819,499,228 to
a total of 369,499,228.  

Our
specific plan of operations and milestones through November 2017 are as follows:  

To
date, we have 18 clients under contract around the globe that we currently deem to be active clients that are either seeking a
listing on a Stock Exchange or OTC Bulletin Board and/or are seeking capital funding for acquisition, growth and expansion:

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1.    

Legal
Proceedings    

On
October 9, 2013, the Company secured a two month loan for GBP 75,000 (equivalent to $120,420) and issued 10,000 restricted shares
of common stock to the lender, The Able Foundation, on December 7, 2013, and also repaid 35,000 GBP (equivalent to $56,196) in
lieu of interest. As the principal and interest was not paid back to the lender on time, the Company compensated the lender with
an additional 20,000 restricted shares of common stock in consideration for a five month extension on the loan. This stock compensation
was issued to the lender also on December 12, 2013. The Company is currently in litigation, in the courts of Dubai, regarding
the Able Foundation loan.  

The
plaintiff, the Able Foundation, is requesting a settlement of $411,272, which is the $226,616 currently owed, and an additional
$184,656 accrued in 2015 as a provision for potential damages.  

On,
June 1, 2015, the Company (the defendant) retained the legal services of a Dubai based law firm called Al Safar   Partners.
Currently, there is a judgment against the Company (the defendant) for the recovery of $411,272.  

The
Company s Dubai lawyers, Al Safar   Partners, have subsequently appealed this judgment based on the fact that they believe
from a legal stand point that:  

1)  
      the
    Company (the defendant) has not been heard, which is a violation of the fundamental principle of law  Audi Alteram Partem .   

2)  
      there
    is no legal existence of Global Equity Partners Plc. in Dubai as it is a Republic of Seychelles corporation; hence, the Courts
    of Dubai have no jurisdiction in the matter.   

According
to the Dubai lawyers, the judgment issued against the Company (the defendant) by the Dubai First Instance Court bears no legality
and is void. Therefore, the Plaintiff s claim should be rejected in its entirety.  

These
legal proceedings and appeal are currently ongoing. The Company intends to vigorously defend the litigation. At this time, the
Company cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.  

Commitments
and Contingencies    

On
October 7, 2015, the Company renewed its rent agreement for its head office in Dubai for a further period of two years. The rental
amount was agreed at $31,850 per annum for the first year (from November 2015 until October 2016) and $35,035 for the second year
(from November 2016 until October 2017). This rental agreement is renewable for a further one year and if renewed the annual rent
will suffer a 5% increase.
