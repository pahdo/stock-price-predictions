EMERSON RADIO CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1   BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Emerson Radio Corp. ( Emerson , consolidated   the  Company ), and its subsidiaries. The Company designs, sources, imports and markets certain houseware and consumer electronic products, and licenses the Company s trademarks for a variety of products domestically and internationally. 
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the Company s consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes; actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and accordingly do not include all of the disclosures normally made in the Company s annual consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 ( fiscal 2016 ), included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, for fiscal 2016. 
 The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year ended March 31, 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ). 
 Whenever necessary, reclassifications are made to conform the prior year s financial statements to the current year s presentation. 
 Unless otherwise disclosed in the notes to these financial statements, the estimated fair value of the financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying value. 
 Sales Allowance and Marketing Support Expenses 
 Sales allowances, marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives which are provided to retailers and distributors are accounted for on an accrual basis as a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the related sales are recognized in accordance with ASC topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , subtopic 50  Customer Payments and Incentives  and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletins 101  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,  and 104  Revenue Recognition, corrected copy  ( SAB s 101 and 104 ). 
 At the time of sale, the Company reduces recognized gross revenue by allowances to cover, in addition to estimated sales returns as required by ASC topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , subtopic 15  Products , (i) sales incentives offered to customers that meet the criteria for accrual under ASC topic 605, subtopic 50 and (ii) under SAB s 101 and 104, an estimated amount to recognize additional non-offered deductions it anticipates and can reasonably estimate will be taken by customers which it does not expect to recover. Accruals for the estimated amount of future non-offered deductions are required to be made as contra-revenue items because that percentage of shipped revenue fails to meet the collectability criteria within SAB 104 s and 101 s four revenue recognition criteria, all of which are required to be met in order to recognize revenue. 
 If additional marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives are required to promote the Company s products subsequent to the initial sale, then additional reserves may be required and are accrued for when such support is offered.

NOTE 2   NET EARNINGS PER SHARE  
 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

NOTE 3   SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
 Outstanding capital stock at September 30, 2016 consisted of common stock and Series A preferred stock. The Series A preferred stock is non-voting, has no dividend preferences and has not been convertible since March 31, 2002; however, it retains a liquidation preference. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had no options, warrants or other potentially dilutive securities outstanding. 

NOTE 4   INVENTORY 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): 

NOTE 5   INCOME TAXES 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had no U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards and approximately $0.3 million of U.S. state net operating loss carry forwards included in net deferred tax assets that are available to offset future taxable income and can be carried forward for 20 years. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized through tax planning strategies available in future periods and through future profitable operating results. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced or eliminated if certain tax planning strategies are not successfully executed or estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. If management determines that the Company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 
 The Company s effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to income and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions and taxed at locally applicable tax rates, subpart F income included in the Company s tax expense, expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes, and state income taxes. 
 The Company is subject to examination and assessment by tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s open tax years for examination for U.S. federal tax are 2011-2016 and for U.S. states tax are 2011-2016. 
 Based on the outcome of tax examinations or due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken in previously filed returns may be different from the liabilities that have been recorded for these unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the Company may be subject to additional tax expense. 

NOTE 6   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 From time to time, Emerson engages in business transactions with its controlling shareholder, The Grande Holdings Limited ( Grande ), one or more of Grande s direct and indirect subsidiaries, and companies related to the Company s Chairman of the Board. Set forth below is a summary of such transactions.  
 7 

Controlling Shareholder  
 S T International Distribution Limited ( S T ), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Grande N.A.K.S. Ltd., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Grande, collectively have the shared power to vote and direct the disposition of 15,243,283 shares, or approximately 56.2%, of the Company s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the Company is a  controlled company  as defined in Section 801(a) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide.     
 Related Party Transactions 
  Return of Pledged Collateral to S T  
 In April 2016, the Company, upon a request made by S T, considered and agreed to return to S T the $500,000 of collateral which S T had paid to the Company in September 2014 as a part of the indemnification agreement between S T, Grande and the Company pertaining to an Internal Revenue Service challenge of the Company s March 31, 2010 earnings and profits calculations underlying the taxability of a dividend paid during March 2010 to all of its stockholders, net of the $79,000 in expenses incurred by the Company in defending the IRS challenge. Thusly, on April 29, 2016, the Company paid $421,000 to S T to effectuate the release of the collateral net of the aforementioned expenses incurred by the Company. From September 30, 2014 through March 31, 2016, this pledged collateral had been recorded by the Company as restricted cash on its balance sheet.     
  Consulting Services Provided to Emerson by one of its Former Directors who is a Current Director of Grande  
 Until such agreement was cancelled by the Company effective November 7, 2013, Mr. Eduard Will, a former director of Emerson and a current director of Grande, was paid consulting fees by the Company for work performed by Mr. Will related to a lawsuit that the Company settled in December 2013 and merger and acquisition research. Mr. Will was not re-elected to serve as a director of the Company at the Company s 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on November 7, 2013. Accordingly, Mr. Will was no longer a director of the Company or a related party to the Company from November 7, 2013 until his appointment as a director of Grande on February 19, 2016, at which time Mr. Will is once again a related party to the Company. 
 During March 2016, Emerson accrued $12,000 in consulting fees and expense reimbursements for consulting work invoiced to the Company and expenses incurred by Mr. Will as a director of the Company during the period September 2013 through November 2013, and which the Company paid to Mr. Will in April 2016. 
  Ancillary Expenses Pertaining to Rented Office Space in Hong Kong   
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was billed approximately $1,000 and $5,000, respectively, for utility and service charges from The Grande Properties Management Limited ( GPML ) and Lafe Strategic Services Limited ( LSSL ), both related parties to the Company s Chairman of the Board, in connection with the Company s rented office space in Hong Kong. The Company owed nil to both GPML and LSSL related to these charges at September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 7   SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS 
 At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company held short term investments totaling $13.1 million and $20.2 million, respectively. These investments were comprised of bank certificates of deposit which will mature in November 2016.

 Results of Operations 
 The following table summarizes certain financial information for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 (fiscal 2017) and September 30, 2015 (fiscal 2016) (in thousands): 

Net product sales     Net product sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $4.8 million as compared to $7.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 37.7%. The Company s sales during the second quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were highly concentrated among the Company s two largest customers   Wal-Mart and Fred Meyer for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and Target and Wal-Mart for the second quarter of fiscal 2016   where gross product sales comprised approximately 88.0% and 71.3% of the Company s total gross product sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.   
 For the six month period of fiscal 2017, net product sales were $10.3 million as compared to $26.1 million for the six month period of fiscal 2016, a decrease of $15.8 million or 60.4%. The Company s sales during the six month periods of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were highly concentrated among the Company s two largest customers   Wal-Mart and Fred Meyer for the six month period of fiscal 2017, and Target and Wal-Mart for the six month period of fiscal 2016   where gross product sales comprised approximately 88.2% and 84.4% of the Company s total gross product sales for the six month periods of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. 
   Net product sales may be periodically impacted by adjustments made to the Company s sales allowance and marketing support accrual to record unanticipated customer deductions from accounts receivable or to reduce the accrual by any amounts which were accrued in the past but not taken by customers through deductions from accounts receivable within a certain time period. In the aggregate, these adjustments had the effect of increasing net product sales and operating income by approximately $44,000 and $19,000 for the second quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, and approximately $81,000 and $42,000 for the six month periods of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Net product sales are comprised primarily of the sales of houseware and audio  
 10 

products which bear the Emerson        brand name. The major elements which contributed to the overall decrease in net product sales were as follows:  

i)   
 
  Houseware product net sales decreased $3.2 million, or 43.6%, to $4.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to $7.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, principally driven by a decrease in year-over-year sales of compact refrigerators and microwave ovens.  The decrease for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was driven by a $3.4 million year-over-year decrease in net sales at one of the Company s former key customers, where the Company s products were discontinued at retail beginning January 1, 2016. For the six month period of fiscal 2017, houseware products net sales were $8.9 million, a decrease of $16.2 million, or 64.7%, from $25.1 million for the six month period of fiscal 2016, principally driven by a decrease in year-over-year sales of compact refrigerators, microwave ovens and wine products. The decrease for the six month period of fiscal 2017 was driven by a $16.8 million year-over-year decrease in net sales at one of the Company s former key customers, where the Company s products were discontinued at retail beginning January 1, 2016.     

 As previously disclosed, the Company expects its net product sales throughout fiscal 2017 to be materially lower than fiscal 2016 due to the discontinuation of its retail business with the aforementioned customer. The Company is analyzing the impacts to its business of this event and is identifying strategic courses of action for consideration. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase sales of housewares products at levels sufficient to offset the material adverse effect of the loss of business with this customer, if at all. 

ii)   
 
 Audio product net sales were $0.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.2 million, or 45.0%, resulting from increased net sales of clock radios. For the six month period of fiscal 2017, audio product net sales were $1.5 million, an increase of $0.5 million or 47.5%, from $1.0 million in the six month period of fiscal 2016 resulting from increased net sales of clock radios.    

  Licensing revenue     Licensing revenue in the second quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $1.2 million. Licensing revenue for the six month period of fiscal 2017 was $2.3 million and for the six month period of fiscal 2016 was $2.4 million.  
 The Company s largest license agreement is with Funai Corporation, Inc. ( Funai ), which accounted for approximately 79% and 80% of the Company s total licensing revenue for the second quarter and six month period of fiscal 2017 and approximately 80% and 78% of the Company s total licensing revenue for the second quarter and six month period of fiscal 2016. The license agreement s term ends on December 31, 2016. The agreement provides that Funai will manufacture, market, sell and distribute specified products bearing the Emerson  trademark to customers in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received non-refundable minimum annual royalty payments of $3.75 million each calendar year and a license fee on sales of product subject to the agreement in excess of the minimum annual royalties. During the second quarters of both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, licensing revenues of approximately $0.9 million were earned under this agreement. During both the six month periods of fiscal 2017 and 2016, licensing revenues of approximately $1.9 million were earned under this agreement.  
 As previously disclosed, on December 16, 2015, the Company received written notice from Funai stating its intention to terminate the agreement, with termination to be effective on December 31, 2016. In accordance with the agreement, in June 2016 Funai paid to the Company the full balance outstanding of the contracted non-refundable minimum annual royalty through the December 31, 2016 termination date in the amount of $2.8 million. Of this amount, $0.9 million was recognized as revenue by the Company in each of the first quarter and second quarters of fiscal 2017. The remaining deferred revenue of $0.9 million on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, will be recognized as revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result of such termination, unless the Company is successful in securing a new licensee to replace the licensing revenue which will be absent upon the Funai termination, the Company expects fiscal 2017 licensing revenue will decline as compared to fiscal 2016 licensing revenue.  As previously disclosed, since this licensing relationship contributes substantial product volume and market presence through Funai s manufacture and distribution of products bearing the Emerson          brand name in the United States, the loss of this relationship and licensing agreement with Funai is expected to materially and adversely affect the Company s revenue, earnings and business. The Company is analyzing the impacts of the Funai termination to its business and is identifying strategic courses of action for consideration, including seeking new licensing relationships.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $39.0 million, as compared to approximately $38.3 million at September 30, 2015. Working capital increased to $55.9 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $55.8 million at September 30, 2015. The increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.7 million was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.3 million, a decrease in royalty receivables of $1.1 million, an increase of deferred revenue of $0.9 million, , a decrease in deferred tax assets of $0.9 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.8 million, a decrease in inventory of $0.7 million and a decrease in restricted cash of $0.5 million partially offset by an increase in short term investments of $3.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $1.5 million, a decrease in long term liabilities of $0.5 million, a decrease in income taxes payable of $0.5 million, a decrease in due to affiliates of $0.5 million, the net loss generated during the prior 12 months of $0.3 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.2 million. 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016, resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable, a decrease in royalty receivable, an increase in deferred revenue, a decrease in prepaid purchases and the net income generated during the period partially offset by an increase in inventory, a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities, a decrease in due to affiliates and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets . 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was $7.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016, due to a reduction in short term certificates of deposit and a decrease in Restricted Cash. 
 Net cash used by financing activities was nil for the six months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, none of the Company s net sales were made by directly importing products to the Company s customers, and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, products representing approximately 41% and 61%, respectively, of net sales were imported directly to the Company s customers. The direct importation of product by the Company to its customers significantly benefits the Company s liquidity because this inventory does not need to be financed by the Company. 
 The Company s principal existing sources of cash are generated from operations. The Company believes that its existing cash balance and sources of cash will be sufficient to support existing operations over the next 12 months. 
 As described above and as previously disclosed, the Company s products were discontinued at retail by one of the Company s former key customers beginning January 1, 2016. In addition, as described above and as previously disclosed, Funai terminated its license agreement with the Company effective as of December 31, 2016. Both of these events will have a material impact on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash position. The Company is analyzing the impacts to its business of these events and is identifying strategic courses of action for consideration. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 The following Accounting Standards Updates ( ASUs ) were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or during the interim period between September 30, 2016 and November 9, 2016 which relate to or could relate to the Company as concerns the Company s normal ongoing operations or the industry in which the Company operates: 
 Accounting Standards Update 2016-17 Consolidation (Topic 810) Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control (Issued October 2016) 
 This Update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. 
 Accounting Standards Update 2016-16 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Issued October 2016) 
 This Update amends current GAAP, which prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party, to require entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Consequently, the amendments in this Update eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. 
 Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Issued August 2016) 
 The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (3) Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) Proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) Distributions received from equity method investees, (7) Beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. 
 Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Issued June 2016)  
 The amendments in this Update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (PCD assets) that are measured at amortized cost basis is determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a credit loss expense for these assets. Interest income for PCD assets should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer s assessment of credit losses at acquisition. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update   2016  -10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (Issued April 2016)   
 The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 3. Determine the transaction price. 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a)  Disclosure controls and procedures  
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d   15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons; by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Our controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 
 The Company s management concluded that disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b)  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHE  R INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Although the Company is not currently a party to any material active litigation, from time to time, third parties assert claims against the Company regarding matters arising out of the ordinary course of business. Management cannot estimate with certainty the Company s ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any litigation matters or the disposition of any claims that it could incur. However, management believes, based on its examination of all existing litigation matters, that the Company s ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
     Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 The Company s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, as updated by Part II, Item 1A of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of the Company s common stock. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 None 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
