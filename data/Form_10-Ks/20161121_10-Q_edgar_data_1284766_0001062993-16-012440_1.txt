1.   
     
        NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING
      CONCERN     
 White Mountain Titanium Corporation,
through its subsidiaries, (collectively, the  Company ) is in the business of
exploring for titanium deposits or reserves on its Cerro Blanco mining
concessions. The Company is an exploration stage company and its principal
business is to advance exploration and development activities on the Cerro
Blanco rutile (titanium dioxide) Property ( Cerro Blanco ) located in Region III
of northern Chile.  
 The accompanying condensed consolidated
interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows at September 30, 2016 and for the period then ended
have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States ( US )
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US
GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31,
2015, Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) on March 28, 2016. The organization and business of the
Company, accounting policies followed by the Company, other than the recently
adopted accounting pronouncements discussed below and other information are
contained in the notes to the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed as part of the Company s
December 31, 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the
period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results for the full year.  
 These condensed consolidated interim
financial statements have been prepared by management on the basis of US GAAP
applicable to a going concern, which assumes the Company will continue to
operate for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. The Company has an
accumulated deficit of $61,792,864 at September 30, 2016 (December 31, 2015 -
$59,653,661), has not yet commenced revenue-producing operations, and has
significant expenditure requirements to continue to advance its exploration and
development activities on the Cerro Blanco property. Management intends to raise
additional capital through stock issuance to finance operations. However, there
is no assurance that management will be successful in its future financing
activities.  

2.   
     
        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES     
 Convertible debentures  
 Convertible debentures and warrants are
bifurcated between debt component and equity component based on the relative
fair values of the debt and warrants. The conversion component of the debt
component is then fair valued and accounted for as an additional discount to the
debt component and is then treated as a derivative liability and fair valued every
balance sheet date. The resulting discount to the debt component is amortized
over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method. 
 The following accounting pronouncements
were adopted by the Company:

      (Unaudited -
      Expressed in US dollars)      

2.   
     
        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   (continued)    
 During the period, the Company adopted
update No. 2015-02  Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidated
Analysis.  The amendments in this Update affect reporting entities that are
required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All
legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation
model. Specifically, the amendments:  

1.  
     
       Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and
      similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting
      interest entities   

2.  
     
       Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should
      consolidate a limited partnership   

3.  
     
       Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities
      that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements
      and related party relationships   

4.  
     
       Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for
      reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to
      comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to
      those in Rule 2a-7 of the  Investment Company Act of 1940  for
      registered money market funds.    
 The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years,
and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2015.  
 The adoption of this standard had no effects on the Company s
condensed consolidated interim financial statements.  
 During the current year, the Company adopted FASB Update No.
2014-12  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for
Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance
Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  (a consensus of
the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The adoption of this standard had no
effects on the Company s condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,
 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs
to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a
debt discount. Prior to the issuance of the standard, debt issuance costs were
required to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard had no effects on the
Company s condensed consolidated interim financial statements.  
 The following accounting pronouncements will become effective in future periods: 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued Update No.
2014-15  Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic
205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern . The amendments in the Update provide guidance on management s
responsibility to disclose conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The Update requires
management also to discuss plans to mitigate the conditions or events and if the
plans will alleviate the substantial doubt by considering the probability of
implementation of the plans and mitigation effect of the plans. The new
requirements are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have significant effects on the
Company s condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   (continued)    
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The core principle of the standard is that a
lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A
lessee should recognize in its statement of financial position a liability to
make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company will be
required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on its financial
statements.  

3.   
     
        FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND
RISKS      

(a)  
     
       The Company has classified its financial instruments as
      follows:    
 Cash   as held-for-trading
 Receivables   as refundable deposits and receivables  Accounts payable
and accrued liabilities   as other financial liabilities  Convertible Note  
as other financial liabilities  Derivative Liabilities   as held for trading
  
 The carrying amounts of the Company s
cash, receivables and accounts payables and accrued liabilities approximate
their respective fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.
The Company s Convertible Note is classified as other financial liabilities and
is carried at amortized cost. The fair value of the Convertible Note
approximates its face value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
described below:  

Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
      markets for identical assets or liabilities;   

Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices
      included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
      directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and

Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability
      that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
     
 The following table summarizes the
fair value by level at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

        FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISKS
   (continued)     

(b)  
     
       Credit risk:    
 Credit risk is the risk that a
counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge its contractual
obligations.  
 The Company mitigates credit risk by
maintaining its cash with high credit quality US, Chilean and Chinese financial
institutions. 

(c)  
     
       Liquidity risk:    
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the
Company will encounter difficulty in satisfying financial obligations as they
become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows
required for operations and anticipated investing and financing activities. The
Company s cash at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 totaled $677,985 and
$396,878, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $171,256, and $135,354,
respectively, all of which fall due in the next fiscal quarter. The Company has
a Convertible Note for principal amount of $2,000,000 which is due on March 16,
2018 (Note 6).    

(d)  
     
       Market risk:    
 Market risk is the risk that the fair
value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest
rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk.  

(i)  
     
       Interest rate risk     

(a)  
     
       To the extent that payments made or received on the
      Company s monetary assets and liabilities are affected by changes in the
      prevailing market interest rates, the Company is exposed to interest rate
      cash flow risk. The Company s Convertible Note is not exposed to interest
      rate cash flow risk as it bears a fixed interest rate.   

(b)  
     
       To the extent that changes in prevailing market interest
      rates differ from the interest rate in the Company s monetary assets and
      liabilities, the Company is exposed to interest rate price
  risk.    
 The Company s cash consists of cash
held in bank accounts. Due to the short-term nature of this financial
instrument, fluctuations in market interest rates do not have a significant
impact on estimated fair values and on cash flows associated with the interest
income.  
 The convertible notes have a fixed
rate of 7% (note 6). The Company is not exposed to interest cash-flow risk as
fluctuations on market rates do not impact the Company s cash-flows.

        FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISKS
   (continued)     

(ii)  
     
       Foreign currency risk    
 The Company is exposed to foreign
currency risk to the extent expenditures incurred or funds received and balances
maintained by the Company are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar
(primarily Chilean pesos ( CLP ), Chinese yuan ( RMB ), and Hong Kong dollars
( HKD )). As at September 30, 2016, the Company has net monetary liabilities of
$9,454 (December 31, 2015 - net monetary liabilities of $44,693) denominated in
CLP, net monetary assets of $1,100 (December 31, 2015 - $7,678) denominated in
HKD, and net monetary assets of $77,204 (December 31, 2015 - $152,095)
denominated in RMB. As at September 30, 2016, the
Company s sensitivity analysis suggests that a change in the absolute rate of
exchange in CLP, RMB and HKD by 10% will not have a material effect on the
Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 The Company has not entered into any
foreign currency contracts to mitigate this risk.  

(iii)  
     
       Other price risk    
 Other price risk is the risk that the
fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to
changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or
foreign currency risk. The Company is not exposed to other price risk.

        MINERAL PROPERTIES     
  Cerro Blanco   
 On September 5, 2003, the Company,
through its wholly-owned Chilean subsidiary, White Mountain Chile, entered into
a purchase agreement with Compa  a Contractual Mineral Ojos del Salado ( Ojos
del Salado ), a wholly-owned Chilean subsidiary of Phelps Dodge Corporation, to
acquire a 100% interest in nine exploration mining concessions, collectively
known as Cerro Blanco. Cerro Blanco is located in Region III of northern Chile,
approximately 39 kilometers, or 24 miles, west of the city of Vallenar.
Consideration for the purchase, including legal fees, was $651,950.  
 The purchase agreement covering Cerro
Blanco was originally entered into between Ojos del Salado and Dorado Mineral
Resources NL ( Dorado ) on March 17, 2000. Under that agreement, Dorado
purchased the mining exploitation concessions from Ojos del Salado for
$1,000,000, of which $350,000 was paid. A first mortgage and prohibitions
against entering into other contracts regarding mining concessions without the
prior written consent of Ojos del Salado had also been established in favor of
Ojos del Salado. On September 5, 2003, White Mountain Chile assumed Dorado s
obligations under the purchase agreement, including the mortgage and
prohibitions, with payment terms as described above.  
  La Martina   
 As a result of regional exploration
carried out in January 2013, a new rutile prospect named La Martina has been
discovered and staked in the Atacama, or Region III, geographic region of
northern Chile. La Martina, which is located approximately 45 kilometres
southwest of the city of Vallenar and 17 kilometres southwest of the Cerro
Blanco project, consists of six registered exploration concessions. Concession
fees and other costs incurred in staking the property have been expensed.  
 Ownership in mineral properties
involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the
validity of certain claims as well as the potential for problems arising from
the frequently ambiguous conveyance history characteristic of mineral
properties. The Company has investigated ownership of its mineral properties,
and to the best of its knowledge, ownership of its interests is in good
standing. At present, the Company has determined that it has no material asset
retirement obligations ( AROs ).

        NOTES PAYABLE     
 On March 16, 2016, the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary Sociedad Contractual Minera White Mountain Titanium
Corporation entered into a loan agreement and issued a 7% Senior Convertible
Promissory Note to the lender for a total of $2,000,000 (the  Convertible
Note ). 
 The Convertible Note has a maturity
date of March 16, 2018 and bears simple interest of 7% per annum on the unpaid
principal amount until the principal amount is repaid in full. 
 The Convertible Note is convertible
into shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock ( Series A Shares ) at the
rate of $0.12 per share, par value of $0.001 per share. Except for the right to
elect one director, the Series A Shares have the same voting rights as Common
Stockholders and are convertible into Common Stock at conversion price of $0.12
per share. The Convertible Note will automatically convert into Series A
Preferred Stock if the Company successfully raises an additional $8,000,000, the
proceeds of which are allocated for certain qualified milestones relating to the
Cerro Blanco project, or if the Company secures a water off-take agreement for
its proposed desalination plant with volume and price components that are
mutually satisfactory to both the Company and the lender. In addition, the
Company issued to the lender 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a
$0.001 par value and warrants to purchase 8,333,333 shares of Common Stock at
price of $0.30 per share until March 16, 2019. An amount of $12 was recognized
for the preferred share issuance which has been recognized as a derivative
liability.  
 In the event of default, the interest
rate increases to 25% per annum. Subject to certain exceptions, the Convertible
Note is senior to any other indebtedness of the Company. 
 The fair value of the liability
component was determined using present value of expected cash-flows. The
conversion component of the Convertible Note was classified as a derivative
liability. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability component was
valued using the Black-Scholes option model using the following assumptions:
volatility of 145.14%, expected term of 2 years, discount rate of 1.13% and
dividend yield of 0%. The warrants were classified as equity and were recorded
as additional paid in capital at their estimated fair value using the
Black-Scholes option model using the following assumptions: volatility of
131.93%, expected term of 3 years, discount rate of 1.13% and dividend yield of
0%.

       Preferred stock    
 During the period ended September 30,
2016, the Company designated 19,000,100 shares of Series A preferred stock with
a par value of $0.001 per share. Each share of preferred stock is convertible
into one common share at any time at the holder s option, at a conversion of
$0.12 per share subject to the adjustments to the conversion ratio. The
adjustment to the conversion price of these preferred shares is based on the
lowest of the share price of any common shares issued, the exercise price of any
options granted or repriced, or any common shares issued after the issuance of
these preferred shares.  
 The preferred stock is unlisted,
non-retractable and non-redeemable. The preferred stockholders are entitled to
the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into
which the preferred stock is convertible. The preferred stockholders are further
entitled to the same dividends and distributions as the common stockholders.
 
 In connection with the issuance of the
Convertible Note ( Note 6 ), 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001
par value, were issued to the note holder. 

(c)  
     
       Stock options    
 The Company has a stock option plan,
adopted in 2005, and a stock option/stock issuance plan, adopted in 2010, which
has been replaced by a stock incentive plan adopted in June 2015 (individually,
the  2005 Plan , the  2010 Plan , and the  2015 Plan , respectively, and,
collectively, the  Plans ). Under the Plans, the Company is authorized to grant
options to executive officers and directors, employees and consultants of the
Company. The 2005 Plan was originally authorized to grant 3,140,000 shares, and
the 2015 Plan was originally authorized to grant 4,641,040 shares, which amount
is increased at the end of each year to represent 10% of the total number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last trading day in December of the
immediately preceding calendar year, less 3,949,500 shares. Effective January 1,
2016, the 2015 Plan authorized shares automatically increased to 5,661,944
shares. The terms of any stock options granted under the 2005 Plan may not
exceed five years and the exercise price of any stock option granted may not be discounted below the
maximum discount permitted under the policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The
terms of any stock options granted under the 2015 Plan may not exceed ten years
and the exercise price of any stock option plan is fixed by the plan
administrator.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations   
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations analyze the major elements of our balance sheets and
statements of operations. This section should be read in conjunction with our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our
unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and accompanying notes to these financial
statements ( financial statements ).   
   Forward Looking Statements    
 The statements contained in this report that are not historical
facts are forward-looking statements that represent management s beliefs and
assumptions based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements
include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of
operations, business strategies, need for financing, competitive position,
potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements,
ability to retain and recruit personnel, the effects of competition and the
effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include
all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as the words  believes,   intends,   may, 
 should,   anticipates,   expects,   could,   plans,  or comparable terminology
or by discussions of strategy or trends. Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct.
Such statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties that could
significantly affect expected results, and actual future results could differ
materially from those described in such forward-looking statements.  
 Among the factors that could cause actual future results to
differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report.
While it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks
and uncertainties including, but not limited to, continued access to financing,
the cyclicality of the titanium dioxide industry, global economic and political
conditions, global productive capacity, inventory levels, changes in product
pricing, changes in product costing, changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
competitive technology positions and operating interruptions (including, but not
limited to, labor disputes, leaks, fires, explosions, unscheduled downtime,
transportation interruptions, war and terrorist activities). Mining operations
are subject to a variety of existing laws and regulations relating to
exploration and development, permitting procedures, safety precautions, property
reclamation, employee health and safety, air and water quality standards,
pollution and other environmental protection controls, all of which are subject
to change and are becoming more stringent and costly to comply with. Should one
or more of these risks materialize (or the consequences of such a development
worsen), or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results
could differ materially from those expected. We disclaim any intention or
obligation to update publicly or revise such statements whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.  
 There may also be other risks and uncertainties that we are
unable to predict at this time or that we do not now expect to have a material
adverse impact on our business.  
   Overview    
 We are a mineral exploration company engaged in the search for
mineral deposits or reserves which could be economically and legally extracted
or recovered. We hold mining concessions covering two rutile properties located
in the Atacama region (Region III) of northern Chile, namely Cerro Blanco and La
Martina.  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 24, 1998.
We have six wholly owned subsidiaries: SCM White Mountain Titanium, a Chilean
stock company which holds our Chilean mining concessions for our Cerro Blanco
project and conducts our principal exploration operations on that property;
White Mountain Metals SpA, an inactive Chilean stock company; White Mountain
Minerals SpA, which holds our Chilean mining concessions for our La Martina
project and conducts our principal exploration operations on that property;
White Mountain Energy Ltda., an inactive Chilean company; White Mountain
Titanium (Hong Kong), a Hong Kong corporation and parent of our Chinese
corporation; and Cerro Blanco Titanium Corporation Limited (Shenzhen), a Chinese
corporation.  
 Our principal business is to explore for and develop natural
rutile deposits on our mining concessions. With the receipt of the RCA for our
water desalination plant, we now have the ability to add the production and sale
of desalinated industrial water to our principal business
interests. Our current principal objectives are to advance the Cerro Blanco
project through the development of the seawater desalination plant, continued
efforts to increase the verified grade and size of the Cerro Blanco deposit,
securing off-take agreements for the planned rutile concentrate output, and
securing strategic financial and development partnerships. We intend to sell
industrial grade desalinated water to local credit-worthy off-takers. We also
intend to sell the rutile concentrate to titanium metal and pigment producers.
In addition, we continue to research into the recovery of feldspar, which, if
successful, would provide another potential income stream from the sale of
feldspar to the glass and ceramics industries.  
 18  

During the current year, we will look to advance our Cerro
Blanco Project on several related fronts. We will solicit bids for additional
drilling to be carried out at Cerro Blanco with the goal of increasing the
overall resource base, and identifying areas of high grade rutile mineralization
which would provide quality process plant feed in the early years of production.
Also, working with Nexo WMTM Holdings, LLC (  Nexo  ), we will seek to
obtain off-take agreements for industrial water, which can be made available for
sale, from our desalination plant. To that end, discussions have already taken
place with a number of interested parties whose water requirements could be met
by our water project. Whilst the production of industrial water is an integral
part of the mining project, sales of surplus water to parties in the Huasco
Valley could represent another potential income stream for the project. 
 Our common stock is currently traded in the over-the-counter
market and is quoted on the OTCQB Markets. Upon meeting listing requirements, it
is our intention to graduate to a more senior exchange in due course.  
 We have produced no revenues, have experienced losses since
inception, have no revenue producing operations, and currently rely upon the
sale of our securities to fund our exploration activities on our mining
properties.  
  Cerro Blanco   
 We are progressing in various stages of development on our
Cerro Blanco project, which is our principal project. We have identified nine
natural rutile prospects designated as the Las Carolinas, La Cantera, Eli,
Chascones, Hororio s Creek, Hippo Ear, Quartz Creek, Algodon and Bono prospects.
The last five of these have only recently been located. We presently hold 58
registered mining exploration concessions and three exploration concessions over
an area of approximately 14,791 hectares.  
  La Martina   
 La Martina consists of six registered exploration concessions,
covering an area of 1,288 hectares, comparable in size to the area covering the
current nine known prospects at Cerro Blanco. Alteration and mineralization at
La Martina is similar to that observed on the Cerro Blanco property.  
  Off-Take Agreements   
 We currently have two definitive off-take agreements in place:

During 2011, we entered into our first off-take agreement
      with a major international pigment producer whereby that producer has
      agreed to purchase 25,000 tonnes per annum of our standard grade, natural
      rutile concentrate at $1,200 per tonne FOB port. Although deliveries did
      not commence by September, 2014, the contract remains in place. The term
      of the agreement may be extended by mutual agreement.    

On September 27, 2012, we entered into a second off-take
      agreement with a major international pigment producer for the supply of
      natural rutile concentrate from the Cerro Blanco project. Under the
      agreement, the pigment producer has agreed to purchase 10,000 tonnes per
      annum of our standard grade rutile concentrate at $1,250 per tonne FOB
      port. The three-year term, which commences upon the production of 5,000
      tons of product from the Cerro Blanco project, may be extended by mutual
      agreement.     
 These two contracts were still in force at September 30, 2016.
 
   Major Developments    
 Since December 31, 2015, we had the following major
developments:  
 19  

Effective March 2, 2016, Mr. Wei Lu resigned as a
      director of the Board. Mr. Lu served on the Audit Committee, the
      Compensation Committee, and the Nomination Committee.    

Effective March 3, 2016 Mr. Howard Crosby resigned as a
      director of the Board. Mr. Crosby served on the Compensation Committee,
      and as a Chairman of the Nominating Committee.    

Effective March 4, 2016, Mr. Kin Wong resigned as Chief
      Executive Officer of the Company, but continued to serve as a
      non-executive Chairman of the Board until the 2016 Annual Shareholders 
      Meeting. Mr. Mike Kurtanjek served as interim Chief Executive Officer
      following Mr. Wong s resignation.    

Effective March 4, 2016, the Board appointed Mr. Bobby E.
      Cooper and Mr. Andrew Sloop to fill the vacancies created by the
      resignations of Messrs. Lu and Crosby.    

On March 16, 2016, under the terms of the Loan Agreement
      dated and entered into on March 16, 2016 (the   Nexo Loan
      Agreement  ) with Nexo WMTM Holdings, LLC (  Nexo  ), we completed
      a debt funding for a total of $2,000,000, which was evidenced by a 7%
      Senior Convertible Promissory Note (the   Nexo   Note  ). The
      Nexo Note is convertible into shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a
      rate of $0.12 per share. Under the terms of the Nexo Loan Agreement, we
      designated 19,000,100 shares of Series A preferred stock with a par value
      of $0.001 per share, of which 100 shares were issued at the date the Nexo
      Loan Agreement was executed. Each share of Series A preferred stock is
      convertible into one common share at a conversion rate of $0.12 per share,
      subject to adjustments to the conversion ratio. We also issued three-year
      warrants to purchase up to 8,333,333 common shares of the Company at $0.30
      per share (the   Nexo Warrants  ). Finally, under the terms of the
      Nexo Loan Agreement, we entered into an Assignment of Development Rights
      with Nexo Water Ventures, LLC (  Nexo Water  ), an affiliate of Nexo,
      relating to the proposed desalination plant to be constructed in
      connection with our Cerro Blanco mining project in Chile (the
        Development Assignment Agreement  ).    

On March 16, 2016, in connection with the signing of the
      Nexo Loan Agreement, the Board approved amendments to our Bylaws to
      implement the voting rights of the Series A Preferred Stock.    

On April 3, 2016, Mr. Bobby Cooper resigned as a director
      of the Board. At the meeting of the Board of Directors held on April 4,
      2016, Mr. Kevin Stulp was elected as a director of the Board to fill the
      vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Cooper and Andrew Sloop was
      appointed as the nonexecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
      Company. Also at the meeting of the Board of Directors held on April 4,
      2016, the Board completed its reconstitution of the nominating and
      compensation committees.    

On July 8, 2016, we held the 2016 Annual Shareholders 
      Meeting where we elected directors and approved other proposals. Five
      directors were elected, namely, Andrew Sloop, Bobby Cooper, David
      Kirkingburg, Greg Ye, and Sue Pei.    

Prior to the Annual Shareholders  Meeting, our Board
      decided to close our China office to conserve cash. As a result, the China
      office relocated to a smaller space and terminated its work force.

Effective September 30, 2016, the Company notified JPES
      Inc., a company owned and controlled by Eric Gan, Chief Financial Officer
      of the Company, that its agreement with the Company would be terminated
      effective December 31, 2016, in accordance with the three-month notice
      provision in the agreement. A new contract may be negotiated with JPES
      Inc. or the Company may engage a new principal financial officer for 2017.

On September 22, 2016, the Company appointed Andrew Sloop
      to replace Michael Kurtanjek as the Interim Chief Executive Officer to
      serve as the principal executive officer of the Company.
    
 20  

Results of Operations    
 We recorded a net loss of $686,131 and $2,139,203 for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 ($0.01 and $0.02 per weighted
average common share outstanding) compared to a net loss of $821,222 and
$3,411,936 ($0.01 and $0.04 per share) for the comparative interim periods in
2015.  
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our
operation expenses for the current comparative period decreased from $3.4
million to $2.1 million due to the changes in the following items:  

Advertising and promotion expense decreased from $275,
      637 to $31,740, an 88% drop. During the first two quarters of 2015, we
      engaged a marketing and consulting firm to increase potential investors 
      awareness of the Company. No such engagement was used during the
      comparable period this year.    

Consulting fees   directors and officers fees decreased
      61% from $794,127 to $278,250 due to management pay cut and eliminating
      several management positions.    

Business consulting expense decreased by 71% from
      $466,815 to $133,556 as we reversed amortization of prepaid financial
      advisory fee due to termination of engagement of a financial advisory
      service. We also procured less consulting services for the same period
      this year.    

Traveling expense decreased 56% from $188,383 to $81,974
      as a result of less management traveling activities during the same period
      this year.    

Bank charge and interest expense increased from $13,237
      to $279,069 due to issuance of convertible notes and the interest
      accretion to the Convertible Note. Excluding the interest accretion
      expense, there were no significant changes in bank charge and interest
      expense during the period compared to the same period in 2015.
      
 Gain on derivative liability of $169,558 comprises of a change
in value during the period of the conversion component of the convertible notes
issued in the first quarter of 2016.  
 Exploration expense is still the largest single expense item in
our operation. It decreased by 17% from $786,604 to $643,817 reflecting reduced
geological work after we received the approval of the EIS. 
 Due to cash constraints, there was no spending on research and
development during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Loss before other items for the current nine-month period was
$2,244,359, compared to $3,370,736 for the comparative period in 2015.  
 In our China operation we lost $64,858 on disposal of office
fixtures and furniture due to the move to a smaller shared office. 
   Liquidity and Cash Flows    
 As of September 30, 2016, we had working capital of $664,383
(December 31, 2015: $460,651), including $677,985 of cash (December 31, 2015:
$396,878).  
 Cash used in operating activities was $1,717,937 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,982,702 for the comparative
interim period in 2015. Investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $956 (2015: $1,025).  
 We raised $2,000,000 from financing activities during the
current nine-month period by issuing a Convertible Note. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we raised $3,255,000 from issuing Common Stock. The
proceeds received will be used to support our operating activities during the
year.  
 21  

We anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds of
$1,500,000 to $4,500,000 to fulfill our commitments stipulated in the EIS as
well as finance the necessary corporate general and administrative expenses in
2016. Alternatively, we are currently analyzing the potential for revenue
generation through strategic partnership buy-in with EPC/development entities on
both the mining and seawater desalination projects. Such an arrangement may
provide funds for further development of the project while eliminating the need
for future highly-dilutive fundraising endeavors. We are seeking such
partnerships only with well-capitalized and capable industry specific entities.
For 2016, we prepared a flexible annual operating budget open to adjustment
depending on our ability to raise capital and the overall Titanium Dioxide
market conditions. The 2017 budget has been reduced to reflect the current cash
position of the Company and to provide the best case for the uninterrupted
operation of the company in the absence of further fundraising. 
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk   
 As a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide
the disclosure required by this item.  
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
   Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures   
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  )) as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by
