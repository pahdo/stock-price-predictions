1.   
 
 Organization:    

 Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P. (formerly known as Warrington Fund L.P.) (the  Partnership ) is a limited partnership organized on November 28, 2005, under the partnership laws of the State of New York to engage in the speculative trading of commodity interests including futures and option contracts. The Partnership does not currently intend to, but may in the future, engage in transactions in spot and forward markets. The Partnership primarily trades futures and options in the stock indices sector. The Partnership commenced trading on February 21, 2006. The commodity interests that are traded by the Partnership are volatile and involve a high degree of market risk. The Partnership privately and continuously offers redeemable units of limited partnership interest ( Redeemable Units ) in the Partnership to qualified investors. There is no maximum number of Redeemable Units that may be sold by the Partnership. 
 Effective as of the close of business on March 31, 2015, Warrington GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, acts as the general partner (the  General Partner ) and commodity pool operator of the Partnership. The General Partner is beneficially owned by Scott C. Kimple. From inception to the close of business on March 31, 2015, Ceres Managed Futures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, acted as the general partner ( CMF GP ) and commodity pool operator of the Partnership. On January 9, 2015, Scott C. Kimple proposed in a Proxy Statement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and distributed to Limited Partners (defined below), that Warrington GP, LLC become the new general partner of the Partnership. The requisite number of each class of limited partnership interests approved the proposals described in the Proxy Statement, and, as a result, Warrington GP, LLC became the new general partner of the Partnership effective as of the close of business on March 31, 2015. CMF GP withdrew as the general partner of the Partnership immediately following Warrington GP, LLC becoming the Partnership s new general partner. References to the  General Partner  herein refer to Warrington GP, LLC and/or CMF GP, as the context requires. 
 Effective as of the close of business on March 31, 2015, Warrington SLP, LP, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the General Partner, became a special limited partner of the Partnership (the  Special Limited Partner ) and receives a quarterly profit share allocation equal to 20% of new trading profits from the Partnership in the form of Redeemable Units, subject to a high water mark. 
 All of the trading decisions for the Partnership are made by Warrington Asset Management LLC (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of the General Partner, using the Strategic Trading Program (formerly, the  Core Trading Program ), a proprietary trading program. 
 The General Partner is not aware of any material changes to the trading program discussed above during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 On June 15, 2011, the Partnership began offering  Class A  Redeemable Units and  Class D  Redeemable Units pursuant to the offering memorandum. All outstanding Redeemable Units on June 15, 2011 were designated Class A Redeemable Units. The rights, powers, duties and obligations associated with the investment in Class A Redeemable Units were not changed. On October 1, 2011, the first Class D Redeemable Units were issued to limited partners of the Partnership (each a  Limited Partner ). Class A Redeemable Units and Class D Redeemable Units will each be referred to as a  Class  and collectively referred to as the  Classes.  The Class of Redeemable Units that a Limited Partner receives will generally depend upon the amount invested in the Partnership, although the General Partner may determine to offer Class A Redeemable Units or Class D Redeemable Units to investors in its sole discretion. On May 1, 2015, a new share class of units of general partner interest  Class GP  was initiated to accept an investment from the General Partner. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership s commodity broker was Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ( Wells Fargo ), a registered futures commission merchant. Effective April 1, 2015, the Partnership entered into a futures and cleared swaps agreement with Wells Fargo (the  Wells Fargo Customer Agreement ). The Partnership pays Wells Fargo trading fees for the clearing and, if applicable, execution of transactions. In addition, with respect to excess cash, Wells Fargo will pay the Partnership interest on excess cash held in the Partnership s account at rates customarily paid by Wells Fargo and as advised to the Partnership from time to time.

    Prior to April 1, 2015, Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. ), a registered futures commission merchant, also served as a commodity   broker. The Partnership was a party to a futures brokerage account agreement with MS Co. (the  MS Co. Customer Agreement ). The Partnership paid MS Co. trading fees for the clearing and, where applicable, execution of transactions. The MS Co. Customer Agre  ement has been terminated.  
 As of April 1, 2015, the Partnership maintains a continuing services agreement with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (d/b/a Morgan Stanley Wealth Management). Pursuant to the continuing services agreement, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management will receive a monthly fee in respect of certain partnership interests which have been sold to certain individuals and entities with an ongoing relationship with Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (the  MS Interests ) equal to (i) 1/12 of 2.00% (2.00% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class A Redeemable Units and (ii) 1/12 of 0.75% (0.75% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class D Redeemable Units. The fees paid to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management shall continue only for as long as the MS Interests remain outstanding. 
 As of April 1, 2015, the Partnership maintains a selling agreement with Robert W. Baird   Co. Incorporated ( Baird ). Pursuant to the selling agreement, Baird will receive a monthly ongoing selling agent fee equal to (i) 1/12 of 2.00% (2.00% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class A Redeemable Units and (ii) 1/12 of 0.75% (0.75% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class D Redeemable Units. With respect to current Limited Partners that are customers of Baird, the Partnership shall pay Baird a monthly ongoing maintenance fee equal to (i) 1/12 of 2.00% (2.00% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class A Redeemable Units and (ii) 1/12 of 0.75% (0.75% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class D Redeemable Units for services provided to such current Limited Partners. 
 As of April 1, 2015, the Partnership maintains a continuing services agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC. Pursuant to the continuing services agreement, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC will receive a monthly fee in respect of certain partnership interests which have been sold to certain individuals and entities with an ongoing relationship with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (the  CS Interests ) equal to (i) 1/12 of 2.00% (2.00% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class A Redeemable Units and (ii) 1/12 of 0.75% (0.75% per year) of month-end Net Assets for Class D Redeemable Units. The fees paid to Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC shall continue only for as long as the CS Interests remain outstanding.

 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:    

 The accompanying financial statements and accompanying notes are unaudited but, in the opinion of the General Partner, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership s financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and changes in partners  capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements present the results of interim periods and do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements. You should read these financial statements together with the financial statements and notes included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2015 information has been derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 The General Partner and each Limited Partner share in the profits and losses of the Partnership, after the allocation to the Special Limited Partner, in proportion to the amount of Partnership interest owned by each, except that no Limited Partner shall be liable for obligations of the Partnership in excess of its capital contribution and profits, if any, net of distributions and losses, if any. 
 The Partnership s trading of futures and options contracts, if applicable, on commodities is done primarily on United States of America commodity exchanges. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership engaged in such trading through commodity brokerage accounts maintained with Wells Fargo. 
 Due to the nature of commodity trading, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.

    Partnership s Investments:   The fair value of exchange-traded futures and options contracts is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement pric  e for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period.  
 All commodity interests are held for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as described below) at the measurement date. Investments in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains or losses on option contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account on the Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains or losses and any change in net unrealized gains or losses from the preceding period are reported in the Statements of Income and Expenses. 
 The Partnership s investments in U.S. government securities as of September 30, 2016 consist of short-term U.S. Treasury bills ( T-Bills ). The T-Bills are reported at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. 
 Investment Company Status : The Partnership follows Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-08,   Financial Services   Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements   and, based on the General Partner s assessment, the Partnership has been deemed to be an investment company since inception. Accordingly, the Partnership follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of Topic 946 and reflects its investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  
 Income Taxes:  Income taxes have not been provided as each partner is individually liable for the taxes, if any, on its share of the Partnership s income and expenses. The General Partner concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Partnership s financial statements. The Partnership files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax returns are currently under examination. The 2012 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. The General Partner does not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions that require recognition of a tax liability.  
 There have been no changes with respect to the Partnership s critical accounting policies as reported in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

 Financial Highlights:    

 Financial highlights for each Limited Partner Class for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

*   
 
 Annualized (except allocation to Special Limited Partner, if applicable).    

**   
 
 Interest income less total expenses (exclusive of allocation to Special Limited Partner, if applicable).    

The above ratios and total return may vary for individual investors based on the timing of capital transactions during the period. Additionally, these ratios and total return are calculated for the Limited Partner Classes using the Limited Partners  share of income, expenses and average net assets. 

4.   
 
 Trading Activities:    

 The Partnership was formed for the purpose of trading contracts in a variety of commodity interests, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. The results of the Partnership s trading activities are shown in the Statements of Income and Expenses. 
 The futures and cleared swaps agreement between the Partnership and Wells Fargo gives, and the customer agreement between the Partnership and MS Co. gave, the Partnership the legal right to net unrealized gains and losses on open futures and option contracts. The Partnership netted as applicable, for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures and option contracts on the Statements of Financial Condition as the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification 210-20,   Balance Sheet,   have been met. 
 Ongoing selling agent fees paid to Baird, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC were calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value on the last day of each month and were affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. 
 Trading and transaction fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisor for the Partnership. All trading, exchange, clearing, user, give-up, floor brokerage and National Futures Association ( NFA ) fees (collectively, the  clearing fees ) paid to Wells Fargo and executing brokers, as applicable, are, and all clearing fees paid to MS Co. were, borne by the Partnership. 
 All of the commodity interests owned by the Partnership are held for trading purposes. The monthly average number of put and call option contracts held during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 2,913, 2,221 and 1,956, 2,456, respectively.

 Fair Value Measurements:    

 Partnership s Fair Value Measurements . Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  
 GAAP also requires the use of judgment in determining if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive. The General Partner has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace, the Partnership s Level 1 assets and liabilities are actively traded. 
 The Partnership will separately present purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in its reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements (i.e., to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net basis), and make disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as required under GAAP. 
 12 
 
 Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P. 
     Notes to Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 
 (Unaudited) 
   
    The Partnership considers prices fo  r exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1). The values of futures and certain option contracts for which market quotations are not readil  y available are priced by broker-dealers that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). As of and for the periods ended   September 30, 2016     and December 31, 2015, the Partnership did not hold any derivative instru  ments for which market quotations were not readily available and which were priced by broker-dealers that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2) or that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs throu  gh the application of the General Partner s assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3). Any transfers between levels are recognized at the beginning of the period. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     and the twelve months ended   December 31, 2015, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2.  

6.   
 
 Financial Instrument Risks:    

 In the normal course of business, the Partnership is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include futures and options, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, to purchase or sell other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an exchange or over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward and option contracts. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include certain forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer, or seller, of an option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instruments, including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. None of the Partnership s current contracts are traded OTC, although contracts may be traded OTC in the future.

    Futures Contracts  . The Partnership trades futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, at a specified price on a   specified future date, unless the contract is closed before the delivery date or if the delivery quantity is something where physical delivery cannot occur (such as the S P 500        Index), whereby such contract is settled in cash. Payments ( variation margin   ) may be made or received by the Partnership on each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying instruments, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Partnership. When the contract is closed, the Partnersh  ip records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of c  ash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, directly with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the S  tatements of Income and Expenses.  
 Options . The Partnership may purchase and write (sell), both exchange listed and OTC, options on commodities or financial instruments. An option is a contract allowing, but not requiring, its holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific or standard commodity or financial instrument at a specified price during a specified time period. The option premium is the total price paid or received for the option contract. When the Partnership writes an option, the premium received is recorded as a liability in the Statements of Financial Condition and marked to market daily. When the Partnership purchases an option, the premium paid is recorded as an asset in the Statements of Financial Condition and marked to market daily. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on option contracts are included in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  
 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Partnership due to market changes, including interest rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The Partnership is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The Partnership s risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership s risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods included in this report, as MS Co. and/or Wells Fargo or their affiliates were the sole counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership s assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that, through MS Co. or Wells Fargo or their affiliates, the Partnership s counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risks with respect to Wells Fargo. 
 The Partnership s trading will be concentrated in exchange-traded futures and options on the S P 500    Index. Concentration in a limited number of commodity interests may subject the Partnership s account to greater volatility than if a more diversified portfolio of contracts were traded on behalf of the Partnership. 
 As both a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Partnership to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Partnership does not consider these contracts to be guarantees. 
 The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership s risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and, accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions. 
 The risk to the Limited Partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership s net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.

     Notes to Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 
 (Unaudited) 
   
    The majority of these financial instruments mature within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the Partnership s business, these instruments may not   be held to maturity.  

7.   
 
 Subsequent Events:    

 The General Partner evaluated events that occurred after the balance sheet date but before financial statements were issued. The General Partner has assessed the subsequent events through the date of issuance and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment of or disclosure in the financial statements.

Item 2.   
 
          Management s Discussion and Analysis o  f Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its only assets are its equity in its trading account (consisting of cash and cash margin and options purchased at fair value) and investments in U.S. government securities, at fair value. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the third quarter of 2016. 
 The Partnership s capital consists of capital contributions of its partners, as increased or decreased by realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, subscriptions and redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership s capital decreased 14.6% from $88,330,055 to $75,423,522. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 13,639.42 Class A Redeemable Units totaling $16,237,518, which was partially offset by net income of $3,328,764 and Class GP addition of 1.98 units totaling $2,221. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in commodity contract positions in subsequent periods. 
  Critical Accounting Policies  
 The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the December 31, 2015 annual Financial Statements. 
 The Partnership records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and change in net unrealized gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and Expenses. 
  Results of Operations  
 During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Class A unit increased 2.2% from $1,208.90 to $1,235.84, as compared to a decrease of 0.7% in the third quarter of 2015. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Class D unit increased 2.3% from $1,277.06 to $1,306.68, as compared to a decrease of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2015. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses and interest income in the third quarter of 2016 of $2,910,026. Gains were primarily attributable to the trading of commodity futures in the S P 500    Index Futures, S P 500    Index Calls and the S P 500    Index Puts. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses and interest income in the third quarter of 2015 of $965,965. Gains were primarily attributable to the trading of commodity futures in the S P 500    Index Futures, S P 500    Index Calls and S P 500    Index Puts. 
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership recorded trading gains in S P 500    Index options.  The most significant gains were achieved during September as increased volatility in S P 500    Index prices provided the Partnership with profit opportunities as the S P 500    Index traded with multiple up and down moves during the month. The Partnership used positions at multiple expiration dates to capture gains and aggregate to a positive return for the month. The Partnership s gains from the prior quarter were augmented by trading gains in August. The strong rally in July caused the ratio put spreads held by the Partnership to decrease in value.  
 During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Class A unit increased 4.4% from $1,183.23 to $1,235.84, as compared to an increase of 2.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Class D unit increased 5.2% from $1,242.14 to $1,306.68, as compared to an increase of 3.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses and interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $6,975,319. Gains were primarily attributable to the trading of commodity futures in the S P 500      Index Calls and the S P 500      Index Puts. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses and interest income in the  nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $8,241,105. Gains were primarily attributable to the trading of commodity futures in the S P 500      Index Calls and the S P 500      Index Puts.  
   
   During the first nine months of the year the Partnership recorded trading gains in S P 500      Index options.  The most significant gains were achieved during June as the Partnership was able to profitably close out its ratio put spreads due to volatility in domestic markets   
 16 

cause  d by problems in the UK due to the Brexit vote. Gains were also recorded during April, May, August, and September from the Partnership s ratio put spread positions. The Partnership achieved nominal gains for February. January, March, and July saw small los  ses for the Partnership due to sharp moves in the S P 500        Index (the market declined precipitously in January, and climbed rapidly in March and July).  
 Commodity markets are highly volatile. Broad price fluctuations and rapid inflation increase the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increase the possibility of profit. The profitability of the Partnership depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisor to correctly identify those price trends. Price trends are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisor is able to identify them, the Partnership expects to increase capital through operations. 
 Interest income beginning April 1, 2015 is earned at Wells Fargo at 90% of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill discount rate on assets maintained in cash and on a percentage of the Partnership s assets that are directly invested in U.S. Treasury bills. Prior to that date and during prior periods included in this report, interest income on 80% of the Partnership s daily average equity maintained in cash in its account during each month was earned at the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $27,862 and $113,377, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in interest income is due to higher U.S. Treasury bill rates, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership during the reporting period depended on the average daily equity in the Partnership s account, and upon interest rates over which the Partnership has no control. 
 Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated on the Partnership s adjusted net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset value. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $85,306 and $387,745, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. This decrease is due to lower average net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. 
 Clearing fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisor for the Partnership. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the number of trades executed during the period. Clearing fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $95,548 and $191,265, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease in clearing fees is primarily due to a decrease in the number of trades executed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. All clearing fees are borne by the Partnership. 
 Advisory/management fees, which are paid to the Advisor, are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Advisory/management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $85,051 and $408,187, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease in advisory/management fees is due to lower average net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. 
 Administrative fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Administrative fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $42,523 and $204,090, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease in administrative fees is due to lower average net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. 
 Special Limited Partner profit share allocations (incentive fees) are based on the new trading profits earned by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership, at the end of the quarter, as defined in the limited partnership agreement among the Partnership, the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner and the Advisor. There was a profit share allocation of $2,221 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and  no profit share allocations made for the corresponding periods in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Special Limited Partner will not receive a profit share allocation until the Advisor recovers the net loss incurred and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership. 
 In allocating the assets of the Partnership to the Advisor, the General Partner considered the Advisor s past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner is permitted to modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisor at any time.

Item 3.   
 
          Quantitative and Qualita  tive Disclosures about Market Risk.     

 The Partnership is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Partnership s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Partnership s main line of business. 
 The limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment. 
 Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnership s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash balances. The Partnership s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Partnership s open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades. 
 The Partnership rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Partnership s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results. 
  Value at Risk  is a measure of the maximum amount which the Partnership could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Partnership s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Partnership of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Partnership s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Partnership s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Partnership s attempts to manage its market risk. 
 Exchange margin requirements have been used by the Partnership as the measure of its Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. 
 Value at Risk tables represent a probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in market sensitive instruments. The following tables indicate the trading Value at Risk associated with the Partnership s open positions by market category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the highest, lowest and average values during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. All open position trading risk exposures of the Partnership have been included in calculating the figures set forth below. There has been no material change in the trading Value at Risk information previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership s total capitalization was $75,423,522.

Item 4.   
 
     Controls and Procedures    

 The Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership on the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports it files is accumulated and communicated to the General Partner, including the Sole Manager of the General Partner, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings. 
 The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Partnership s external disclosures. 
 The General Partner s Sole Manager has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016, and, based on that evaluation, the General Partner s Sole Manager has concluded that, at that date, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 The Partnership s  internal control over financial reporting  is a process under the supervision of the General Partner s Sole Manager to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership;     

provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and (ii) the Partnership s receipts are handled and expenditures are made only pursuant to authorizations of the General Partner; and     

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.     

 There were no changes in the Partnership s  internal control over financial reporting  process during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
