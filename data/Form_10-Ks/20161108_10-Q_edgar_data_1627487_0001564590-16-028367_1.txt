 1. Description of Business 
 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) operates upscale Brazilian  churrascaria  steakhouses under the brand of Fogo de Ch o. As of October 2, 2016, the Company operated, through its subsidiaries, 32 restaurants in the United States and 10 restaurants in Brazil and one joint venture restaurant in Mexico. 
 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. is a holding company with no assets or operations of its own. The Company owns 100% of Brasa (Purchaser) Inc. ( Brasa Purchaser ), which owns Brasa (Holdings) Inc. ( Brasa Holdings ). Brasa Holdings owns Fogo de Ch o (Holdings) Inc. ( Fogo Holdings ), which owns the Company s domestic and foreign operating subsidiaries. 
 On June 24, 2015, the Company completed an initial public offering (the "IPO") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters  discounts and commissions and offering costs, the Company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $91,317. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under the Company s 2012 Credit Facility (Note 7). 
 In connection with the closing of the IPO, the Company effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated in the accompanying financial statements, and in the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the financial statements, to give effect to the stock split. 

2. Basis of Presentation 
 Interim Financial Statements 
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, results for any interim financial period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. In addition, quarterly results of operations may be impacted by the timing and amount of sales and costs associated with the opening of new restaurants. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements do not represent complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. While the condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of January 3, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements, it does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements, and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. 
 Revised Consolidated Balance Sheet 
 The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2016 has been revised to reflect the following adjustment to correct for an error considered immaterial: 

To correct for an error in the accounting for a prior period business acquisition resulting from the omission of a previously unidentified acquired asset.

 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  This adjustment resulted in an increase in other receivables and total current assets, and a corresponding decrease in goodwill. This adjustment did not impact the Company s previously reported total assets, total liabilities or total equity as of January   3, 2016 and did not impact the previously reported consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. The table below presents the impact of these adju  stments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2016.  

Revised Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
 The consolidated statement of cash flows for the thirty-nine week period ended September 27, 2015 has been revised to reflect the following adjustments to correct for errors considered immaterial: 

The payment of capital expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as cash outflow from investing activities. Payment of these capital expenditures had previously been reflected as cash flows used in operating activities through the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses.      

The purchase of liquor licenses, capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets, as cash outflows from investing activities. The Company had previously reflected these purchases as cash flows used in operating activities through the change in prepaid expense and other assets.

  These adjustments resulted in an increase in reported net cash flows provided by operating activities and an increase in reported net cash flows used in investing activities. These adjustments did not impact the Company s previously r  eported overall net change in cash and cash equivalents and did not impact the previously reported consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The table below presents the impact of these adjustments   on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Principles of Consolidation 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company, as well as consolidated joint ventures for which the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Accounting Year 
 The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year convention whereby its fiscal year ends each year on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally is comprised of four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. Fiscal 2016 will include 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks of operations.

  3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers  compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, the fair value of share-based compensation, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Capitalized Interest 
 Direct and certain related indirect costs of construction, including interest, are capitalized in conjunction with construction and development projects. These costs are included in property and equipment and are amortized over the life of the related building and leasehold interest. The Company capitalized $31 and $52 of interest during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016, respectively, and capitalized $28 and $59 of interest during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015, respectively.  
 Fair Value 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation models based upon the degree to which they are observable. The three levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy are as follows: 
 Level 1: Inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable or the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life. 
 Level 3: Inputs are unobservable and therefore reflect management s best estimate of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
 As of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their carrying value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amounts of the long-term debt approximate fair value as interest rates vary with the market interest rates and negotiated terms and conditions are consistent with current market terms (Level 2).   
 Revenue 
 Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold and is presented net of employee meals and complimentary meals. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. The Company recognizes gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and the Company determines there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies. The Company estimates the gift card breakage rate based upon the pattern of historical redemptions. The Company recognized $16 and $57 of gift card breakage revenue during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016, respectively, and $18 and $49 in gift card breakage revenue during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015, respectively. 
 Insurance Reserves 
 Beginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers  compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. The Company estimates the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. The Company s estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, the Company engaged a third party actuary to assist it in estimating its liability for workers  compensation claims. The Company elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers   
 10 
 
 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarte  r of Fiscal 2015 the Company did not discount the estimated liability for workers  compensation claims. The Company believes that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate   of the liability.  
 The Company s estimated liability for workers  compensation claims was $1,775 and $1,580 as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, calculated based on a discounted cash flow basis. The undiscounted liability was approximately $1,900 and $1,700 as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively. The estimated current portion of $631 and $585 as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated non-current portion is included in other non-current liabilities. 
 The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions. The accrued liability attributable to these other self-insurance programs was $300 and $266 as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.  
 To limit exposure to losses, the Company maintains stop-loss coverage through third-party insurers. The deductibles range from approximately $200 to $250 per claim.  
 Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) 
 The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company is deemed to have a controlling interest as a result of the Company having both the power to direct the activities that significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If the Company has a controlling interest in a VIE, the assets, liabilities, and results of the operations of the variable interest entity are included in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Segment Reporting 
 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. owns and operates full-service, Brazilian steakhouses in the United States and Brazil using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under the Company s single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, and similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. ASC 280,   Segment Reporting   requires use of the   management approach   model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company s segments consist of two operating segments: United States and Brazil. The Company s joint venture in Mexico is included in the United States for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the United States segment management. 
 Concentration Risk 
 The Company relies on one distributor for substantially all of its beef purchases for its operations in the US. However, the products purchased through this distributor are widely available at similar prices from multiple distributors. The Company does not anticipate any risk to the business in the event that one or all of these distributors is no longer available to provide their goods or services. However, a change in suppliers could potentially result in different costs. 

4. Recent Accounting Standards 
   
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) .  This update requires that entities with a classified balance sheet present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of July 3, 2016 on a retrospective basis resulting in a reclassification of $2,918 of current deferred tax assets against non-current deferred tax liabilities of $15,951 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. 
 11 
 
 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ,  which changes the presentation of debt issuance   costs in financial statements, requiring an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which   clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs attributable to line-of-credit arrangements after the adoption of ASU 2015-03. In particular, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs   related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2  015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of April 3, 2016. The Company s finan  cial statement presentation was consistent with the guidance in ASU 2015-15. As a result, there was no impact to the Company s consolidated balance sheet upon adoption. Unamortized debt issuance costs as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, which are at  tributable to the Company s 2015 Credit Facility (revolving line-of-credit), are included in other assets (noncurrent) in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of oper  ations or cash flows.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .  ASU 2016-09 requires among other things that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company has elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur as provided under ASU 2016-09. The adoption of this guidance did not a have material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .  ASU 2015-02 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this new standard during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Effect of New Accounting Standards 
 Recent accounting pronouncements not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers .  The core principle of the standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. New qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements aim to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ," which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one-year for all entities. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ," in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ," and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ," all of which

  provide additional clarificat  ion on certain topics addressed in ASU 2014-09. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after Dece  mber 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The Company has not yet selected a transition method or determined the effect, if any, that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .  ASU 2014-15 will require management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The new standard is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company will be required to adopt this new standard at year-end Fiscal 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842) .  The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ,  which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,  which clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.

  5. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses  
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following: 

6. Joint Ventures 
 Mexico 
 On July 1, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with a non-related party ( Mexican JV Partner,  and together with the Company, the  Parties ), to form JV Churrascaria Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (the  Mexican JV ), for the purposes of jointly developing, constructing and operating Brazilian style steakhouses under the  Fogo de Ch o  name in certain locations in Mexico. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, the Company owns 51% of the ownership interests in the joint venture and is entitled to receive 50% of the profits of the joint venture after the Parties recoup their initial contributions. The Company is also entitled to a license fee equal to a percentage of the annual gross revenue of each restaurant developed, constructed or operated by the Mexican JV. In May of 2015, the Mexican JV opened its first restaurant in Mexico City. 
 The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the joint venture since the Company will have the power to direct activities that significantly impact the entity on a day-to-day basis. These activities include, but are not limited to having an affirmative vote over key operating decisions of the joint venture.  
 Fogo Holdings recognized $26 and $82 in license fee income during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016, respectively, and recognized $43 and $80 in license fee income during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015, respectively. This income, and the related expense recognized by the Mexican JV, are eliminated in consolidated net income. The license fee expense, recognized by the Mexican JV, is included in net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. The license fee income, recognized by Fogo Holdings, is included in net income attributable to Fogo de Ch o, Inc. 
 Net income (loss) from the Mexican JV for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, have been allocated to the Company s joint venture partner in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement. The assets of the consolidated joint venture are restricted for use only by the joint venture and are not available for the Company s general operations.

  The following table presents the consolidated assets and liabilitie  s of the Mexican JV included within the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively.  

Accounts payable include $7 and $14 due to the Company as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, and are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Middle East 
 During the first quarter of Fiscal 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a shareholders agreement with a non-related party to form FD Restaurants Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the  Middle East JV ), for the purposes of jointly developing, constructing and operating Brazilian style steakhouses under the  Fogo de Ch o  name in certain locations in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will own 51% of the ownership interests in the Middle East JV and will be entitled to receive 50% of the profits of the Middle East JV after the parties recoup their initial contributions. The Company will be entitled to a license fee equal to a percentage of the annual gross revenue of each restaurant developed, constructed or operated by the Middle East JV. The Company accounts for its investment in the Middle East JV under the equity method as it has determined that it does not have a controlling interest in the Middle East JV since the Company will not have the power to direct activities that significantly impact the Middle East JV on a day-to-day basis, but does have the ability to exercise significant influence. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any amounts of license fee income attributable to the Middle East JV, as the construction of restaurants included in the joint venture are currently in process. As of October 2, 2016, the Company has no basis in the Middle East JV as it has not contributed any capital to the entity.  

7. Long-Term Debt 
 Long-term debt consists of the following: 

On June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, the Company refinanced its existing credit facility (the  2012 Credit Facility ) and Brasa (Holdings) Inc., an indirect subsidiary of the Company, as the borrower (the  Borrower ) and Brasa (Purchaser) Inc., a direct subsidiary of the Company, entered into a new credit facility (the  2015 Credit Facility ). 
 15 
 
 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  Upon   the closing of the IPO, the Company drew down $165,000 under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding existing debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.    
 The 2015 Credit Facility provides for (i) a $250,000 revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and (ii) incremental facilities that may include (A) one or more increases to the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility, (B) the establishment of one or more new revolving credit commitments and/or (C) the establishment of one or more term loan commitments. The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020. 
 The Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries are subject to affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender remedies). The Borrower is required to maintain two financial covenants, including a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio, as that term is defined in the 2015 Credit Facility (at levels that may vary by quarter until maturity), and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as that term is defined in the 2015 Credit Facility. The Company was in compliance with each of these covenants at October 2, 2016 and at January 3, 2016. 
 Because the Company is not required to make principal payments on any outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility until June 24, 2020, any outstanding balance is reported as non-current in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as a component of long-term debt. 
 As of October 2, 2016, the Company had six letters of credit outstanding for a total of $3,316 as well as $91,684 of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility. 
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2015 Credit Facility are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the related credit facility. Remaining unamortized debt issuance costs were $2,163 and $2,595 as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, and are included in other assets (noncurrent) in the consolidated balance sheets. 

8. Share-Based Compensation  
 In 2012, the Company established its 2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the  2012 Plan ). Prior to the IPO, the Company granted share-based awards pursuant to the 2012 Plan. In connection with the IPO, the Company adopted its 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ). All outstanding equity awards under the 2012 Plan will remain outstanding under the 2012 Plan and will be governed by the 2012 Plan and their respective award agreements.  
 The 2012 Plan provides for the Company to sell or issue restricted common stock or to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights or other share-based awards to employees, members of the board of directors and consultants of the Company. Each award will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2012 Plan and to those other terms and conditions specified in the underlying award agreement. Under the 2012 Plan, a maximum of 2,291,296 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance of stock-based awards.  
 Awards granted under the 2015 Plan may consist of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other share-based awards and cash awards. Each award will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2015 Plan and to those other terms and conditions specified in the underlying award agreement. The 2015 Plan authorizes up to 1,200,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Plan.  
 Both the 2012 Plan and the 2015 Plan are administered by the board of directors of Fogo de Ch o, Inc., or, at the discretion of the board of directors, by a committee of the board. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions are determined at the discretion of the board of directors, or a committee of the board, as applicable, except that the exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of the stock option may not be greater than ten years (the maximum allowed contractual life).

 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  Stock Options  
 Prior to the IPO, stock options granted under the 2012 Plan were typically granted to employees in two tranches, each with separate exercise prices. The exercise price for the first tranche was based on the fair value of common stock on the date of grant, and the exercise price of the second tranche was typically 200% of the fair value of common stock on the date of grant. These options typically vest upon both (i) the completion of a four or five year vesting period and (ii) the satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as that term is defined in the stock option award agreement. Under the terms of the option award agreement, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. As the completion of a Liquidity Event cannot be considered probable until it occurs, no expense associated with these awards was recorded until the Liquidity Event occurred. Upon the closing of  the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event  vesting condition. The Company recognized $5,658 of compensation expense associated with these options upon the closing of the IPO. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity from January 3, 2016 through October 2, 2016: 

As of October 2, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of $878 of unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to outstanding stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. 
 Restricted Stock 
 The Company has granted restricted common stock with time-based vesting conditions. Unvested shares of restricted common stock may not be sold or transferred by the holder. These restrictions lapse according to the time-based vesting conditions of each award which is typically between two and four years. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s restricted stock activity from January 3, 2016 through October 2, 2016: 

As of October 2, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of $124 of unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to outstanding restricted common stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

  Share-Based Compensation Expense  
 The Company recorded share-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock in the following expense categories in its statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss): 

Shares Available 
 As of October 2, 2016, 251,658 and 1,076,530 shares remained available for future issuance under the 2012 Plan and 2015 Plan, respectively.  

9. Employee Benefit Plans 
 401(k) Plan   Effective July 1, 2016, the Company implemented a 401(k) plan to provide retirement benefits for certain employees.  
 Deferred Compensation Plan   Effective July 1, 2016, the Company implemented a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan is intended to provide current tax planning opportunities and supplemental funds upon retirement or death for certain key employees designated and approved by the Company to be eligible to participate in the deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan enables its participants with the opportunity to voluntarily elect to defer the timing of payment of base salary and/or bonuses. 

10. Earnings Per Share 
 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Fogo de Ch o, Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Fogo de Ch o, Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities determined using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities include shares of common stock underlying stock options and unvested restricted stock. The following table sets forth the computations of basic and dilutive earnings per share: 

The Company excluded stock options to purchase 0.7 million shares of common stock from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended  October 2, 2016,   because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

 Fogo de Ch o, Inc. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  The Company excluded stock options to purchase 0  .2 million shares of common stock from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  

11. Income Taxes   
 The Company estimated its annual effective tax rate to be applied to the results of the thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015 for purposes of determining its year-to-date tax expense. The determination of the Company s overall effective tax rate requires the use of estimates. The effective tax rate reflects the income earned and taxed in various United States and Foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases and decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, tax credits and the Company s change in income in each jurisdiction all affect the overall effective tax rate. 
 The Company recognized income tax expense of $2,295 (consolidated effective tax rate of 33.8%) and $7,977 (consolidated effective tax rate of 32.5%) for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016, respectively. The Company s consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, subpart F income, and nondeductible equity compensation.  
 The Company recognized income tax benefit of $253 and $13,582 for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015, respectively. The Company had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the United States earnings from the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that undistributed net earnings of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and the Company s intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions drove the Company s decision to make the assertion. As a result of the change in assertion, the Company reduced its deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13,877 in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. In June 2015, the Company also made the decision to release its valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities related to assets with indefinite lives. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and future projections of US pretax income (plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led the Company to believe that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets. The Company s consolidated effective tax rate, exclusive of discrete tax benefit, was approximately 4.8% for the thirty-nine week period ended September 27, 2015. The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine week period ended September 27, 2015 was positively impacted by the release of the valuation allowance in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. 
 Because the Company considers the undistributed earnings related to its Brazilian subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and are expected to continue to be indefinitely reinvested, no provision for United States income and additional foreign taxes has been recorded on aggregate undistributed earnings of $42,500. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries, the Company would record a deferred tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings in the amount of approximately $15,000. As of October 2, 2016, $21,044 in cash and cash equivalents is held in Brazil by the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries and would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States. 

12. Commitments and Contingencies 
 Lease Commitments  
 The Company leases its corporate office and various of its restaurant locations under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have initial lease terms of between ten and twenty years and generally carry renewal options that can extend the term of the leases for an additional five to ten years.

 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
   
  Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases (excluding contingent rental payments) are as follows:  

Future minimum lease payments attributable to locations in Brazil and Mexico, which will be made in the functional currency of the respective countries, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate. 
   
 Rent expense, attributable to non-cancelable operating leases for the Company s corporate office and restaurant locations, was $5,467 and $4,833 for the thirteen week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively, and was $15,349 and, $13,610 for the thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. 
 Litigation  
 The Union of Workers in Hotels, Apart-Hotels, Motels, Flats, Restaurants, Bars, Snack Bars and Similar in S o Paulo and the Region (the  Union ) brought claims in 2011 on behalf of certain employees of one of the Company s Sao Paulo restaurants asserting that the restaurant charged mandatory tips and did not properly calculate compensation payable to or for the benefit of those employees. The claims were initially dismissed in 2011 but the Union pursued various appeals of its claims. A regional labor court rendered a decision in 2014 that partially granted one of the Union appeals and ordered the restaurant to make unquantified payments based on its determination that the restaurant charged mandatory tips. At that time, the restaurant recorded a reserve of R$100,000 (Brazilian Real), the amount established by the judge for the calculation of court fees. The restaurant appealed to the superior labor court, which did not grant the appeal. The decision of the regional labor court became final in November 2015 and the claims were remitted to the first labor court to proceed with the next phase of the matter. The Company is currently engaged in the delivery of documents and information to, and negotiations with, the Union. At this time, the Company does not know how many employees could be affected or the relevant time period for, or the appropriate method of, calculating any amounts that may be payable. In light of the forgoing and the inherent uncertainties involved in Brazilian labor matters, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses that may result from the Union s claims. 
 The Company is currently involved in various claims, investigations and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims and investigations resulting from employment-related matters. None of these matters, many of which are covered by insurance, has had a material effect on the Company. The Company is not party to any material pending legal proceedings and is not aware of any claims that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

13. Segment Reporting 
 The Company owns and operates full-service Brazilian steakhouses in the United States and Brazil under the brand name Fogo de Ch o. Each restaurant operates with similar types of products and menus, providing a continuous service style, irrespective of location. Sales from external customers are derived principally from food and beverage sales, and the Company does not rely on any major customers as a source of sales. The Company s joint venture in Mexico is included in the United States for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the United States segment management.

  The following table presents the financial informati  on of the Company s operating segments for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015.  

The Company s chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance using restaurant contribution, which is not a measure defined by GAAP. Restaurant contribution is a key metric used to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at the restaurants, to evaluate restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate restaurant financial performance compared with competitors. Restaurant contribution is defined as revenue less restaurant operating costs (which includes food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs and occupancy and certain other operating costs but excludes depreciation and amortization expense). Depreciation and amortization expense is excluded because it is not an ongoing controllable cash expense. 
 The following table sets forth the reconciliation of total segment restaurant contribution to income from operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015.

For all periods presented, total assets include assets attributable to the Company s corporate office in the United States and assets that are not directly attributable to restaurant operations.    

14. Related-Party Transactions  
 In July 2012, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with an affiliated entity of its private equity fund owners ( Sponsor ) to provide management, consulting and financial and other advisory services to the Company (the  Advisory Services Agreement ). The Advisory Services Agreement required the Company to pay Sponsor a non-refundable periodic retainer fee in an amount per year of the greater of $750 or 1.50% of Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Advisory Services Agreement, for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The Advisory Services Agreement was terminated upon the consummation of

  the IPO and the Company paid a one-time fee of $7,544 to terminate the Advisory Services Agreement during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. The Company recorded $593 of   expense during the thirty-nine week period ended September 27, 2015, attributable to periodic retainer fees. This expense is included in general and administrative costs in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Compa  ny had no outstanding payable due to Sponsor at January 3, 2016 related to the Advisory Services Agreement.   
 In February 2015, the Company entered into three Director Securities Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to three independent directors 9,292 shares of common stock each, at a purchase price of $10.78 per share.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, guidance, future plans, objectives and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or results of operations, our prospects and strategies for future growth, the development and introduction of new products, and the implementation of our marketing and branding strategies. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as  may,   will,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential,   seeks,   intends,   targets  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 and other factors noted below in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Except as required by applicable securities law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 
 In this section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under GAAP, but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on our fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to our fiscal years and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 
 We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally is comprised of four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ending January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016. 
 Overview 
 Fogo de Ch o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or  churrascaria , which has specialized for over 36 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of  churrasco . We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as  espeto corrido  (Portuguese for  continuous service ) delivered by our  gaucho  chefs. We offer our guests a tasting menu of a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors. 
 Guests can begin their dining experience at the Market Table, which offers a wide variety of Brazilian-inspired side dishes, fresh-cut vegetables, seasonal salads, aged cheeses and cured meats, or they can receive immediate entr e service table-side from our  gaucho  chefs by turning a service medallion, found at each guest s seat, green side up. Each  gaucho  chef rotates throughout the dining room, and is responsible for a specific cut of meat which they prepare, cook and serve to our guests continuously throughout their meal. Guests can pause the service at any time by turning the medallion to red and then back to green when they are ready to try additional selections and can communicate to our  gauchos  their preferred cut of meat, temperature and portion size. Our continuous service model allows customization and consumer engagement since our guests control the variety and quantity of their food and the pace of their dining experience. Through the combination of our authentic Brazilian cuisine, unique service model, prix fixe menu and engaging hospitality in an upscale restaurant atmosphere, we believe our brand delivers a differentiated dining experience relative to other specialty and fine-dining concepts and offers our guests a compelling value proposition.

Growth Strategies and Outlook  
 Our growth is based on the following strategies: 

Grow our restaurant base;     

Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and     

Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital.     

 We believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 44 current restaurants, 32 in the US, including our newest domestic restaurant that we opened in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in July 2016, 10 in Brazil and two joint venture restaurants in Mexico. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there exists a long-term growth potential for over 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 13.3% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to strong future growth. 
 Highlights and Trends 
 Restaurant Development 
 Restaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. During January 2016 we opened our 42 nd  location in Naperville, Illinois and in late July 2016 we opened our 43 rd  location in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. We plan to open up to as many as five to six restaurants during Fiscal 2016, including one international joint venture restaurant. We believe our international joint venture restaurants will allow us to expand our restaurant footprint with limited capital investment by us. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In Brazil, we plan to open three to five new restaurants over the next five years. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities. 

Events in Brazil  
 In March and April of 2015, a series of protests began in Brazil against the current government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S o Paolo, with an estimated number of protestors on March 15, 2015 of approximately one million. Protests continued throughout the remainder of March and into April. As a result of the protests, our restaurants in Brazil experienced reduced guest traffic in the second half of March 2015 and in April 2015. Additional protests occurred in many cities throughout Brazil on August 16, 2015, which resulted in a slight reduction in guest traffic. In March 2016 there were additional anti-government and anti-corruption protests throughout Brazil. In April 2016, the Brazil government began the impeachment process of the Brazil president which ultimately led to the removal of the president from office in August 2016. Various allegations, trials or convictions of federal or state government officials could lead to political instability. It is possible that further protests or other social unrest, political activity or political instability may occur in Brazil, which could impact our guest traffic, thereby affecting our revenue and net income. In addition to the uncertain political environment and events discussed above, Brazil continues to suffer from an economic recession that negatively impacts our guests. 
 Rio de Janeiro was host to the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants realized an approximate $1.4 million increase in sales, as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. 
 25 

Exchange Rate Impact  
 We have experienced significant foreign currency impact during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the US dollar strengthens compared to the Brazilian Real, it has a negative impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate continued foreign currency volatility throughout Fiscal 2016 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See  Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information  on page 39 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods. 
 Commodity Pricing 
 We have experienced lower and stable beef prices thus far in Fiscal 2016, which has allowed us to improve food costs over the same period in the prior year. However, the food-at-home (grocery store or supermarket food items) CPI is down 2.2% from September 2015 and remained flat or decreased for seven of the first nine months in Fiscal 2016. With food-at-home prices declining, consumers demand for dining in restaurants may fall. 
 Key Events 
 Initial Public Offering 
 On June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering ("IPO") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters  discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility. 
 Certain equity-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. 
 As a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. ( THL ). Funds affiliated with THL hold approximately 79.5% of our outstanding common stock. We paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination of that agreement during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. 
 While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs. We will continue to use our operating cash flows to fund capital expenditures to support restaurant growth, as well as to invest in our existing restaurants, infrastructure and information technology. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
 The financial impact of the IPO affects the comparability of our post-IPO financial performance to our pre-IPO financial performance. 
 2015 Credit Facility 
 Concurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the  2015 Credit Facility ). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. 
 26 

Stock Split  
 In connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split. 
 Income Taxes 
 As a result of the IPO, and the subsequent use of proceeds to pay down debt, we reviewed our position on indefinite reinvestment of the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries  undistributed earnings pursuant to ASC 740-30-25 (formerly APB 23). Considering the significant reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis, along with our plan for future international growth, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would now be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. As a result of the change in assertion, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million as a discrete item in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and no longer provide for US income and additional foreign taxes related to undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment of undistributed earnings we would record a tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings. 
 Additionally, as a result of the IPO and reduced debt service costs, the Company reviewed its valuation allowance and determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets without regard to deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite lived intangibles. The Company analyzed sources of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it would release its valuation allowance. Ultimately, historic cumulative earnings, coupled with the Company s change in capital structure resulting from the IPO, led the Company to recognize its net deferred tax asset. 
 Investments in Human Capital to Support Growth 
 To support our future growth and improve our operations and management team, over the last three years we have made significant investment in personnel costs by adding positions to our corporate team in executive positions and key functional areas and added local sales manager positions and assistant manager positions at the restaurant level. 
 Performance Indicators 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. 
 New Restaurant Openings 
 Our ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a  number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations.  The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities. 
 Comparable Restaurant Sales  
 We consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year convention. For fiscal years following a 53 week year the Company calculates comparable restaurant sales using the most comparable calendar week to the current reporting period. 
 27 

Average Check Per Person  
 Average check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests  preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures. 
 Average Unit Volumes  
 We measure average unit volumes ( AUVs ) on an annual (52-week) basis. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base. 
 Guest Counts  
 Guest counts are measured by the number of entr es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. 
 Restaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin 
 Restaurant contribution is defined as revenue less restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of restaurant contribution to revenue for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 compared to the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015 is provided on pages 33 and 37, respectively. 
 We believe that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. We use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization plus the sum of certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, equity-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, retention agreement costs, IPO related costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors. 
 28 

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations a  s analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditur  es or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment  s, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements fo  r such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of o  ur ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the thirteen and thirty-nine week   periods ended October 2, 2016 compared to the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015 is provided on page 38.  
 Significant Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Revenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.  
 Food and Beverage Costs 
 Food and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants. 
 Compensation and Benefit Costs 
 Compensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, equity-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue. 
 Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses 
 Occupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
 Marketing and Advertising Costs 
 Marketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue. 
 29 

General and Administrative Costs  
 General and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, equity-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation and compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue. 
 Pre-opening Costs 
 Pre-opening costs are costs incurred prior to, and directly associated with, opening a restaurant, and primarily consist of manager salaries, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, employee payroll and related training costs for new employees, including rehearsal of service activities, as well as straight-line lease costs incurred prior to opening. In addition, pre-opening costs include public relations costs incurred prior to opening. We typically start incurring pre-opening costs four months prior to opening and these costs tend to increase four weeks prior to opening as we begin training activities. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life. 
 Income Tax Expense  
 Income tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense. 
 Segment Reporting 
 We operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management.

 Revenue 
 Total revenue for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 increased $8.0 million, or 13.2%, compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, due to a $6.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales, a $1.0 million increase in comparable restaurant sales, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.8 million. Total comparable restaurant sales increased 0.6%. 
 31 

US restaurant revenue for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 increased $5.9 million, or 11.5%, compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, due to a $5.8 million incr  ease in non-comparable restaurant sales and a $0.1 million increase in comparable restaurant sales. Due to the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015, the comparable restaurant sales calculation is based on comparing sales in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 (13-week pe  riod ended October 2, 2016) to the corresponding calendar period of 2015 (13-week period ended October 4, 2015). Total US comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.0%.  
 Brazil restaurant revenue for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 increased $2.2 million, or 21.8%, compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, due to a $0.9 million increase in comparable restaurant sales and a $0.5 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales both mainly attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.8 million. Brazil comparable restaurant sales increased 9.0%. 
 Food and Beverage Costs 
 Food and beverage costs for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 increased $1.5 million, or 8.2%, compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, due to a $1.8 million increase in food and beverage costs of non-comparable restaurants, offset by a $0.3 million decrease in food and beverage costs of comparable restaurants. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased from 30.5% to 29.2%, principally due to reductions in protein commodity pricing and improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings. 
 Compensation and Benefit Costs  
 Compensation and benefit costs increased $3.1 million, or 23.9%, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016, due to a $2.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expense and a $0.8 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expense. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased from 21.6% to 23.6%, due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings and increases in group health insurance claims and minimum wages. 
 Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses 
 Occupancy and other operating expenses increased $2.5 million, or 22.1%, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016, due to a $1.6 million increase in non-comparable restaurant operating expenses, a $0.7 million increase in comparable restaurant operating expenses, and a $0.2 million unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating expenses increased from 18.2% to 19.7%, as a result of reduced sales leverage and increased fixed occupancy cost. 
 Marketing and Advertising Costs  
 Marketing and advertising costs increased $0.4 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 due to a planned increase in advertising spend. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased from 2.2% to 2.5%. 
 General and Administrative Costs  
 General and administrative costs increased $0.9 million, or 21.9%, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016, primarily due to a $0.6 million increase in corporate compensation expense and a $0.2 million increase in legal and professional expense. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased from 6.7% to 7.2%. 
 Pre-opening Costs 
 Pre-opening costs increased $0.2 million to $1.1 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 we incurred pre-opening expenses on one restaurant that opened during the quarter and an additional five restaurants that were under construction at quarter end. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2015 we incurred pre-opening expenses on four restaurants that were under construction at quarter end. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 was consistent with the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, however, interest expense decreased from 1.9% to 1.6%. 
 32 

Interest Income  
 Interest income increased $0.4 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances. As a percentage of total revenue, interest income increased from 0.4% to 0.9%. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit)  
 The Company recognized income tax expense of $2.3 million, with a consolidated effective tax rate of 33.8%, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company s consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.   
 The Company recognized income tax benefit of $0.3 million for third quarter of Fiscal 2015, primarily due  to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and release of the valuation allowance . In June 2015, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. Additionally, in June 2015 the Company determined that it would realize its net deferred tax asset and, as a result, released its valuation allowance of $2.8 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. These benefits were included in the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 used in the calculation of income tax expense (benefit) for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015.

 Total restaurant contribution for the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 increased $0.9 million, or 5.1% compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, due to a $0.6 million increase attributable to non-comparable restaurants and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of revenue, total restaurant contribution decreased from 29.7% to 27.5%. 
 As a percentage of US restaurant revenue, contribution margin decreased 2.5% from 29.0% to 26.5%, due to a 2.7% increase in compensation and benefit costs due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings and increases in group health insurance claims and minimum wages, and a 1.7% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses as a result of reduced sales leverage and

 Total revenue increased $13.3 million, or 6.8%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, due to an $18.1 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales, offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $3.4 million and a $1.5 million decrease in comparable restaurant sales due to a one week shift in sales weeks.  Due to the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015, the comparable restaurant sales calculation is based on comparing sales in the 39-week period ended October 2, 2016 to the corresponding 39-week period ended October 4, 2015.  Total comparable restaurant sales were flat. 
 US restaurant revenue increased $15.0 million, or 9.3%, due to a $17.1 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales, offset by a $2.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant sales. US comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.4%. 
 Brazil restaurant revenue decreased $1.8 million, or 5.5%, primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $3.4 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in restaurant sales attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics. Brazil comparable restaurant sales increased 2.3%. 
 Food and Beverage Costs 
 Food and beverage costs increased $1.0 million, or 1.8%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, due to a $5.3 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants, offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable food and beverage costs and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $1.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased from 30.1% to 28.7% due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts. 
 Compensation and Benefit Costs  
 Compensation and benefit costs increased $5.1 million, or 11.9%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, due to a $6.8 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.5 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million and a $1.6 million decrease in equity-based compensation expense due to the cumulative compensation expense recognized in conjunction with the IPO during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased from 22.3% to 23.3%, due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings and increases in group health insurance claims and minimum wages. 
 Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses 
 Occupancy and other operating expenses increased $5.5 million, or 16.4%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, due to a $4.9 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expense and a $1.2 million increase in comparable restaurant expense, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.6 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating expenses increased from 17.3% to 18.9% as a result of reduced sales leverage and increased fixed occupancy costs. 
 Marketing and Advertising Costs 
 Marketing and advertising costs increased $0.5 million, or 11.0%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, primarily due to a planned increase in advertising spend. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising increased from 2.4% to 2.5%. 
 General and Administrative Costs  
 General and administrative costs decreased $11.6 million, or 43.0%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, due to a $4.4 million decrease in cumulative equity-based compensation expense that was recognized in connection with the IPO, a $0.8 million decrease in IPO related expenses and a $7.5 million charge for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015, offset by a $1.1 million increase in corporate compensation expense. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs decreased from 13.9% to 7.4%. 
 Pre-opening Costs 
 Pre-opening costs decreased $0.2 million to $2.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016. During the period we incurred pre-opening expense on two restaurants that opened and an additional five restaurants that were under construction at period-end. During the comparable period in prior year we incurred pre-opening expense on three restaurants that opened during the period and an additional four restaurants that were under construction at period-end. 
 35 

Loss on Extinguishment / Modification of Debt  
 On June 24, 2015 we paid-off our existing 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus the proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016 decreased $5.6 million, or 62.8%, due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, interest expense decreased from 4.6% to 1.6%.  
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased $1.0 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances. As a percentage of total revenue, interest income increased from 0.3% to 0.7%. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 The Company recognized income tax expense of $8.0 million, with a consolidated effective tax rate of 32.5%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016. The Company s consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.  
 The Company  recognized income tax benefit of $13.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015 due primarily to the reversal of $13.9 million in deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. The Company had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the United States earnings from the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we determined that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. Additionally, in June 2015 the Company determined that it would realize its net deferred tax asset and as such, released its valuation allowance of $2.8 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. These benefits were included in the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 used in the calculation of income tax expense (benefit) for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 27, 2015.

 Total restaurant contribution increased $1.6 million, or 2.7%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, primarily due to a $1.0 million increase attributable to non-comparable restaurants and a $1.6 million decrease in equity-based compensation, offset by a $1.0 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact. As a percentage of revenue, total restaurant contribution decreased from 30.3% to 29.1%. 
 As a percentage of US restaurant revenue, contribution margin decreased 1.4% from 30.2% to 28.8%, due to a 1.6% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses due to increased fixed occupancy costs, and a 1.1% increase in compensation and benefit costs due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings and increases in group health insurance claims and minimum wages, offset by reductions in equity-based compensation expense and workers compensation expense and a 1.3% decrease in food and beverage costs due to reductions in meat commodity pricing and improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings. 
 As a percentage of Brazil restaurant revenue, contribution margin increased 0.6% from 30.3% to 30.9%, due to a 1.5% decrease in food and beverage costs primarily due to a decrease in meat consumption and a decrease in protein commodity pricing, a 0.6% decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to reduced hourly labor costs, offset by a 1.5% increase in occupancy and other operating expenses as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs.

Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information   
 As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of certain results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors  ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year-to-date period presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at foreign currency exchange rates of 3.2433 and 3.4973 Brazilian reais to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016, respectively, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Historically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities. 
 Brazilian operations are funded from cash generated within Brazil. Our US operations are funded from cash generated in the US. As of October 2, 2016, we had $30.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $21.0 million was held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. We consider the undistributed earnings related to our Brazilian subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and expect them to continue to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no provision for US income and additional foreign taxes has been recorded on the aggregate undistributed earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries of $42.5 million as of October 2, 2016. If there is a change in assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment of undistributed earnings we would record a tax liability attributable to those undistributed earnings of approximately $15.0 million. There are no known restrictions that would prohibit the repatriation of the cash and cash equivalents of our Brazilian subsidiaries. 
 We intend to spend approximately $28.0 million to $32.0 million in Fiscal 2016 on capital expenditures, including approximately $22.0 million to $25.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $2.0 million to $4.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling. 
 39 

At October 2, 2016, our wor  king capital deficit (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $11.2 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $30.1 million. We believe that our cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our l  iquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which   we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.   
 The following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented. 

(a)   
 
 The consolidated statement of cash flows for the thirty-nine   week period ended September 27, 2015 has been revised to correct classification errors. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $22.4 million to $36.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, primarily due to a $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, a $8.0 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, and a $7.5 million decrease in general and administrative costs due to a one-time payment of $7.5 million in the prior year related to the termination of the advisory services agreement with an affiliate, offset by a $1.2 million decrease in cash related to prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $0.8 million increase in taxes paid in cash. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased $9.9 million to $25.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016, primarily due to the timing of new restaurant construction and restaurant reimaging projects during the year. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was $8.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016 mainly due to the $10.0 million of repayments on the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by $1.1 million in net activity related to non-controlling interests. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015 due to the net proceeds of the IPO offset by the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility and the proceeds of the 2015 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. 
 2015 Credit Facility 
 On June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.   
 The 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.   
 At our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate.  The  Applicable Rate  for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio.  The current Applicable Rate is (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 0.75% and (ii) in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 1.75%.  
 40 

The 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type  .  The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we are required to maintain two financial c  ovenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that may vary by quarter until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. Currently, these required ratios are 5.50 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively. The Com  pany was in compliance with these covenants at October 2, 2016.   
 As of October 2, 2016, we had six letters of credit outstanding for a total of $3.3 million and $91.7 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 In Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, we disclosed that we had $365.0 million in total contractual obligations as of January 3, 2016. Other than the items discussed below, there have been no material changes in our total obligations during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2016 outside of the normal course of our business.  
 We lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2016 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. During the thirty-nine week period ended October 2, 2016, we entered into five additional leases, adding estimated minimum future rental payments of approximately $27.5 million attributable to these non-cancelable operating leases. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of October 2, 2016, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $3.3 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 We believe our critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016.  
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 4 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements. 
 JOBS Act 
 We are an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater  
 41 

obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.  
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 
 We will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  
 The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the US dollar. However, during the thirty-nine week periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, we generated approximately 14.7% and 16.7%, respectively, of our revenue in Brazil. As a result, we experienced significant foreign currency impact during Fiscal 2015 and 2016 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. For example, if the US dollar strengthens it would have a negative impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. The exchange rate of the Brazilian Real against the US dollar hit a multi-year low in January 2016. Any hypothetical loss in revenue could be partially or completely offset by lower food and beverage costs and lower selling, general and administrative costs that are generated in Brazilian reais. A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the US dollar compared to the Brazilian Real would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $0.5 million for the thirty-nine week period ended October 2, 2016 and approximately $0.4 million for the thirty-nine week period ended September 27, 2015. To the extent the ratio between our revenue generated in Brazilian reais increases as compared to our expenses generated in Brazilian reais, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts and option contracts. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. 
 Interest Rate Risk  
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our debt, which bears interest at variable rates and is a function of our Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio as defined in the 2015 Credit Facility agreement. As of October 2, 2016, we had total aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings of $155.0 million. A 1.00% increase in the effective interest rate applied to these borrowings would result in an interest expense increase of $1.6 million on an annualized basis. We manage our interest rate risk through normal operating and financing activities and, when determined appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
 Inflation 
 Inflationary factors such as increases in food, beverage and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue if our menu prices do not increase with these increases.

Item 4. Controls   and Procedures  
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management establishes and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, as well as other key members of our management. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 2, 2016 because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described under  Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We are not currently required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) until the year following our first annual report is required to be filed with the SEC. As discussed in our final prospectus filed on June 19, 2015, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for Fiscal 2013, the period from May 24, 2012 to December 30, 2012, and the period from January 2, 2012 to July 20, 2012, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. A  material weakness  is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In particular, we did not design an effective control environment with sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training to assess the completeness and accuracy of the technical accounting matters, principally related to accounting for business combinations, accounting for modifications of debt instruments, nor did we have a sufficient number of accounting personnel to allow for appropriate segregation of duties or thorough review and supervision of our financial closing process. We also did not design, maintain or implement effective control activities relating to formal accounting policies. Specifically, we did not design, maintain or implement policies and procedures to adequately review and account for transactions that arise in the normal course of business, which limited our ability to make accounting decisions and to detect and correct accounting errors. As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, these material weaknesses resulted in errors in the accounting for and classification of certain transactions, which resulted in a restatement of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 and the restatement of the first three fiscal quarters of Fiscal 2014, and revisions to our statements of cash flows for our first three fiscal quarters of Fiscal 2015. Each of the material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of our financial statements or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Plans for Remediation of the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have taken steps to remediate the material weaknesses such as hiring additional accounting personnel in Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015, including a chief financial officer, a director of financial reporting, a corporate treasury analyst and a corporate accounting manager, and in early November 2016 we filled a newly created position of vice-president of accounting and controller. While we have begun the process of evaluating the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting, we have not completed our evaluation. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHE  R INFORMATION  
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Since opening our first location in the US in 1997, we have brought churrasqueiros, or  gaucho  chefs, to the US from Brazil utilizing the L-1B  specialized knowledge  visa which generally permits an employee to remain in the US for up to five years. We also utilize the L-1A  intracompany manager  visa for our employees who qualify. The L-1A visa generally permits an employee to remain in the US for up to seven years. The Department of Homeland Security s Bureau of Citizenship   Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly INS) began to narrow its interpretation of L-1B visa eligibility as to all corporate petitioners in 2007. Beginning in 2009, the USCIS ceased approving our L-1B visas and recommended that the petitions of 10 then current L-1B visa holders be revoked. We contested the adverse actions before USCIS, and then sued USCIS in US District Court. The US District Court affirmed the USCIS denials in 2013, but we appealed that determination, and on October 21, 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted our appeal, reversed the USCIS denial, and remanded the representative L-1B petition in question to the district court, with instructions to vacate the denial and to remand to USCIS for further consideration in light of the Court s correction of USCIS s factual and legal adjudication errors. USCIS reopened the matter pursuant to the D.C. Circuit s remand order. On June 12, 2015, USCIS again denied the L-1B petition. On August 7, 2015, we filed a complaint for declaratory and mandamus relief in the US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to overturn the latest USCIS denial and effectuate the prior holding of the D.C. Circuit. The government answered our complaint on October 13, 2015, and the parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. All briefing in the case was completed on February 5, 2016, and the case is now under consideration by the Court. On September 26, 2016, the District Court ruled that the USCIS improperly disregarded substantial evidence as our evidence was adequate to conclude that the gaucho churrasqueiro position involves specialized knowledge but that we did not provide enough evidence that a particular individual completed our training program. Each party to the proceeding has the right to appeal. 
 The Union of Workers in Hotels, Apart-Hotels, Motels, Flats, Restaurants, Bars, Snack Bars and Similar in S o Paulo and the Region (the  Union of Workers ) brought claims in 2011 on behalf of certain employees of one of our S o Paulo restaurants asserting that the restaurant charged mandatory tips and did not properly calculate compensation payable to or for the benefit of those employees. The claims were initially dismissed in 2011 but the union pursued various appeals of its claims. A regional labor court rendered a decision in 2014 that partially granted one of the union appeals and ordered the restaurant to make unquantified payments based on its determination that the restaurant charged mandatory tips. At that time, the restaurant recorded a reserve of R$100,000 (Brazilian Real), the amount established by the judge for the calculation of court fees. The restaurant appealed to the superior labor court, which did not grant the appeal. The decision of the regional labor court became final in November 2015 and the claims were remitted to the first labor court to proceed with the next phase of the matter. The Company is currently engaged in the delivery of documents and information to, and negotiations with, the union. At this time, the Company does not know how many employees could be affected or the relevant time period for, or the appropriate method of, calculating any amounts that may be payable. In light of the foregoing and the inherent uncertainties involved in Brazilian labor matters, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses that may result from the union s claims; however, an adverse outcome could materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. The Union of Workers also represents certain employees of our other four locations in S o Paulo. The Union of Workers negotiated a new collective agreement applicable for the period 2015 through 2017. Based on the terms of the new agreement, the Company believes that the Union of Workers would not have the same arguments it made before if it now brought claims on behalf of employees of the four S o Paulo restaurants that were not covered by the prior decision. Nonetheless, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in Brazilian labor matters, there can be no assurance that the Union of Workers will not pursue such claims and, if so, that such claims would be rejected; an adverse outcome could materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. 
 We are currently involved in various claims, investigations and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including claims and investigations resulting from employment-related matters. None of these matters, many of which are covered by insurance, has had a material effect on us. We are not party to any material pending legal proceedings and are not aware of any claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
     Item 1A. Risk Factors    
 There are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to information set forth in this quarterly report, you should carefully read and consider "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, which contain descriptions of significant risks that might cause our actual results of operations in  
 44 

future p  eriods to differ materially from those currently anticipated or expected. There have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended January 3, 2016.
