NOTE 1 Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation ( CTS  or  the Company ), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes thereto, and other information included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) necessary for a fair statement, in all material respects, of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. 
    
  Subsequent Events 
    
  CTS has evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior period reclassifications have been made in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of including our other post-retirement benefit plan liabilities in Post-retirement obligations as well as the retrospective application of a new accounting pronouncement upon the adoption of ASU 2015-17 (see Note 18 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional details).   The chart below quantifies the effects of these reclassification adjustments on our December 31, 2015, financial statements:

In June 2016, CTS announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at the Elkhart facility by mid-2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting CTS' global operations ("June 2016 Plan").  Additional organizational changes will also occur in various other locations.  The cost of the plan is expected to be approximately   $16,000   including severance and other one-time benefit arrangements.  We have recorded $2,175 of termination and other one-time benefit charges impacting approximately   230   employees as of   September 30, 2016  .  Additional costs related to line movements, asset impairment and equipment charges, and other costs will be expensed as incurred.  The total restructuring liability related to the June 2016 Plan was   $1,569   at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The following table displays the planned restructuring and impairment charges associated with the June 2016 Plan as well as a summary of the actual costs incurred through   September 30, 2016  : 

Total restructuring and impairment charges for the June 2016 Plan were as follows: 

Not included in restructuring and impairment charges, but directly attributable to the June 2016 Plan, is an increase in tax expense  of $2,316 relating to increases in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for state net operating losses and tax credits and the revaluation of U.S. deferred taxes as a result of a change in our expected future tax rate as discussed in Note 16.  
    
  In April 2014, CTS announced plans to restructure its operations and consolidate its Canadian operations into other existing CTS facilities as part of CTS  overall plan to simplify its business model and rationalize its global footprint ( April 2014 Plan ).  
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, CTS management revised the April 2014 Plan.  The revision added   $4,250   in planned costs.  Additional administrative and legal costs were expected to account for   $1,300   of the additional restructuring and impairment charges.  The remaining   $2,950   in restructuring related charges are for additional costs related to equipment relocation, training, travel and shipping.   
    
  These restructuring actions, which were completed during 2015, impacted approximately   120   positions.  
    
  The following table displays the planned restructuring and restructuring-related charges associated with the April 2014 Plan, as well as a summary of the actual costs incurred through   September 30, 2016  :

Total restructuring, impairment and restructuring related charges under the April 2014 Plan were as follows:  

Total restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was   $436   at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
   In June 2013, CTS announced a restructuring plan to simplify CTS  global footprint by consolidating manufacturing facilities into existing locations ( June 2013 Plan ).  The June 2013 Plan included the consolidation of operations from the U.K. manufacturing facility into the Czech Republic facility, the Carol Stream, Illinois manufacturing facility into the Juarez, Mexico facility and discontinuing manufacturing at the Singapore facility.   Certain corporate functions were consolidated or eliminated as a result of the June 2013 Plan.  These restructuring actions were completed in 2015 and resulted in the reduction of approximately   350   positions. 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2014, CTS management revised the June 2013 Plan.  The revision added   $4,000   in planned costs.  Settlement of the U.K. pension plan was expected to account for   $2,000   of the added cost.  The remaining   $2,000   in restructuring and impairment charges were for severance costs and resulted in the reduction of approximately   130   additional positions throughout CTS businesses.  The above actions were completed in 2015. 
    
  The following table displays the planned restructuring and restructuring-related charges associated with the June 2013 Plan and a summary of the actual costs incurred through   September 30, 2016  :

NOTE 8   Accrued Liabilities 
    
  The components of accrued liabilities are as follows:  

NOTE 9   Contingencies 
  Certain processes in the manufacture of CTS' current and past products create hazardous waste by-products as currently defined by federal and state laws and regulations.  CTS has been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies, and in some cases, generator groups, that it is or may be a potentially responsible party regarding hazardous substances at several sites either presently or historically owned, leased, or operated by CTS.  Some sites are Superfund sites such as in Asheville, North Carolina and Mountain View, California.  CTS reserves for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against CTS with respect to other environmental matters.  CTS records reserves on a undiscounted basis.  In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information relating to all such matters, adequate provision for probable and estimable costs have been recorded.  We do not have any known environmental obligations where a loss is probable or reasonably possible of occurring for which we do not have a reserve, nor do we have any amounts for which we have not reserved because the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated.  Due to the inherent nature of environmental obligations, CTS cannot provide assurance that its ultimate environmental investigation and clean-up costs and liabilities will not materially exceed the amount of its current reserve.  Our reserve and disclosures will be adjusted accordingly if additional information becomes available in the future. 
  Unrelated to the environmental claims described above, certain other claims are pending against CTS with respect to matters arising out of the ordinary conduct of CTS  business.  Although the ultimate outcome of any potential litigation resulting from these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and some may be disposed of unfavorably to CTS, management believes that adequate provision for anticipated costs have been established based upon all presently available information.  Except as noted herein, we do not believe we have any pending loss contingencies that are probable or reasonably possible of having a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

NOTE 10 - Debt 
    
  Long-term debt was comprised of the following: 

14 

Table of Contents  

On August 10, 2015, CTS entered into a new   five  -year credit agreement ( Revolving Credit Facility ) with a group of banks in order to support CTS  financing needs.  The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided for a credit line of   $200,000  .  On May 23, 2016, CTS requested and received a   $100,000   increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under its existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from   $200,000   to   $300,000  .   
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing line sublimit of   $15,000   and a letter of credit sublimit of   $10,000  .  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at CTS  option, at the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans or LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans.  CTS also pays a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.  The commitment fee ranges from   0.20%   to   0.40%   based on the CTS  total leverage ratio.  
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.  Failure of CTS to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.  CTS was in compliance with all debt covenants at   September 30, 2016  .  The Revolving Credit Facility requires that CTS deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditors certifications and compliance certificates within a specified number of days after the end of a quarter and year.  Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions limiting CTS' ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with CTS' subsidiaries and affiliates; and make stock repurchases and dividend payments.  Interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility fluctuate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate and the Company s quarterly total leverage ratio.   
    
  CTS has debt issuance costs related to its long-term debt that are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debt.  These costs are included in interest expense in our Statement of Earnings.  Amortization expense was approximately   $46   and   $61   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, and approximately   $116   and   $165   for the first nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively.  

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments  
  Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  We selectively use derivative financial instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to these risks.  
  The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts. We manage our credit risk by entering into derivative contracts with only highly rated financial institutions and by using netting agreements.  
  Foreign Currency Hedges 
  In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs. The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  At least quarterly, we assess the effectiveness of these hedging relationships based on the total change in their fair value using regression analysis.  The effective portion of derivative gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction affects earnings upon settlement, at which time they are reclassified to cost of goods sold or net sales. Ineffectiveness is recorded in other income (expense) in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  If it becomes probable that an anticipated transaction that is hedged will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period, we reclassify the gains or losses related to that hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expenses).  
  We continue to monitor the Company s overall currency exposure and may elect to add cash flow hedges in the future.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a net unrealized loss of $219 in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which   $201   is expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months.  The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was   $13.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  CTS uses interest rate swaps to convert the revolving credit facility s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate. In the second quarter of 2012, CTS entered into   four   separate interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on   $50,000   of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2012, CTS entered into   four   additional interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on   $25,000   of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2016, CTS entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020.  The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.

These swaps are treated as cash flow hedges and consequently, the changes in fair value were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The estimated net amount of the existing gains or losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is approximately   $246  .   
    
  The location and fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016  , are shown in the following table:  

The Company has elected to net its foreign currency derivative assets and liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with ASC 210-20 (Balance Sheet, Offsetting).  On a gross basis, there were foreign currency derivative assets of   $53   and foreign currency derivative liabilities of   $287  . 
  The effect of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings is as follows:  

NOTE 12   Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income 
    
  Shareholders  equity includes certain items classified as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income ( AOCI ) in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, including: 
    
  Unrealized gains (losses) on hedges   relate to interest rate swaps to convert the line of credit s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates affecting certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies.  These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and CTS has deferred income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs, at which time amounts are reclassified into earnings.  Further information related to CTS  derivative financial instruments is included in Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 15   Fair Value Measurements. 
    
  Unrealized gains (losses) on pension obligations   are deferred from income statement recognition until the gains or losses are realized.  Amounts reclassified to income from AOCI are included in net periodic pension income / (expense).  Further information related to CTS  pension obligations is included in Note 5   Retirement Plans.

Cumulative translation adjustment   relates to our non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar.  CTS is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates.  This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive (loss) income.   
    
  Changes in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are foreign exchange transaction gains or losses.  Transaction (losses)/gains for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were (  $165  ) and (  $1,656  ), respectively, and for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 27, 2015   were   $(3,076)   and (  $4,640  ), respectively, which are included in other income/(expenses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

  The 2009 Plan, and previously the 2004 Plan, provides for grants of incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to officers, key employees, and non-employee members of CTS  Board of Directors.  In addition, the 2014 Plan, the 2009 Plan, and the 2004 Plan allow for grants of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares, performance units, and other stock awards. 
    
  The following table summarizes the compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to equity-based compensation plans: 

The following table summarizes the unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs by type and the weighted-average period in which the expense is to be recognized: 

CTS recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.

The following table summarizes the maximum number of awards available to be granted under these plans as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Stock Options 
    
  Stock options are exercisable in cumulative annual installments over a maximum   10  -year period, commencing at least   one year   from the date of grant.  Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of CTS  stock on the date of grant, vest over   four years  , and have a   10  -year contractual life.  The awards generally contain provisions to either accelerate vesting or allow vesting to continue on schedule upon retirement if certain service and age requirements are met.   The awards also provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control event.  CTS has no stock options exercisable or outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , other than the performance-based stock options described below.  
    
  Performance-Based Stock Options 
    
  During 2015 and 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Committee ) granted a total of   350,000   performance-based stock option awards ( Performance-Based Option Awards ) for certain CTS employees under the 2014 Plan, of which   320,000   remain outstanding after considering forfeitures.  The Performance-Based Option Awards have an exercise price of   $18.37  , a term of   five years  , and generally will become exercisable (provided the optionee remains employed by CTS or an affiliate) upon CTS  attainment of at least   $600,000   in revenues during any of CTS    four  -fiscal-quarter trailing periods (as determined by the Committee) during the term.  CTS has not recognized any expense on these Performance-Based Option Awards for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , since the revenue target is not deemed likely to be attained based on our current forecast. 
  Service-Based Restricted Stock Units 
    
  Service-based RSUs entitle the holder to receive   one   share of common stock for each unit when the unit vests.  RSUs are issued to officers, key employees and non-employee directors as compensation.  Generally, the RSUs vest over a   three  -year period.  RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest   one month   after the grant date.  Upon grant, each non-employee director elects to either receive the stock associated with the RSU immediately upon vesting, or defer receipt of the stock until his or her retirement from the Board of Directors.  The fair value of the RSUs is equivalent to the trading value of CTS  common stock on the grant date.

A summary of the status of RSUs granted under the Director's Plan is presented below: 

Performance and Market-Based Restricted Stock Units 
    
  CTS grants performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain executives.  Vesting may occur in the amount of   zero percent   to   200%   of the grant target.  Vesting is subject to certification of the financial results for the last year in the performance period  by CTS  independent auditors.  The number of awards vesting is dependent upon CTS  achievement of either sales growth targets or cash flow targets as defined in the agreements. 
    
  CTS grants market-based restricted stock unit awards to certain executives and key employees. Vesting may occur in the amount of   zero percent   to   200%   of the grant target.  Vesting is subject to certification of the financial results for the last year of the target range by CTS  independent auditors.  The number of awards vesting is determined using a matrix based on a percentile ranking of CTS' total stockholder return with a peer group total shareholder return over the   three  -year period comprising the performance period.  Vesting is tied exclusively to CTS' total stockholder return relative to peer group companies  total stockholder return rates during the performance period.

NOTE 15   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  CTS uses interest rate swaps to convert our line of credit s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies. These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   
    
  The table below summarizes CTS  financial assets (liabilities) that were measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016  :

The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others.  There is a readily determinable market for these derivative instruments, but that market is not active and therefore they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below provides a reconciliation of the recurring financial assets (liabilities) for our derivative instruments: 

CTS' long-term debt consists of the Revolving Credit Facility which is recorded at its carrying value.   There is a readily determinable market for CTS' long-term debt and it is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the market is not deemed to be active.  The fair value of long-term debt approximates carrying value and was determined by valuing a similar hypothetical coupon bond and attributing that value to our long-term debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
   
  NOTE 16   Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rates for the   three and nine  -month periods in 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

CTS' effective income tax rate was   68.3%   and   31.2%   in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 reflected an increase in valuation allowances recorded against certain state net operating losses and tax credits and the revaluation of U.S. deferred taxes as a result of the June 2016 restructuring activities discussed in Note 7.  The rates also reflect an increase in a valuation allowance on certain non-U.S. losses as a result of changes in the expectation of CTS' ability to utilize those losses, changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, various other discrete items, CTS' decision to no longer permanently reinvest the earnings of its Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, and tax expense for withholding taxes on earnings in China that are not anticipated to be maintained in China.  CTS began recording tax expense for withholding taxes in China in the fourth quarter of 2015 and expects to continue this practice going forward.  During the first nine months of 2015, CTS reflected a benefit attributable to filing amended U.S. federal tax returns in order to take credits for foreign taxes paid which was partially offset by a reserve recorded on an uncertain tax position. 
    
  CTS  continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , CTS accrued   $181   and   $136   of interest or penalties in income tax expense.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , CTS accrued   $552   and   $957   of interest or penalties in income tax expense. 

Note 17 - Business Combinations 
    
  On March 11, 2016, CTS acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in CTG Advanced Materials, LLC ( CTG-AM ), a privately-held company, for   $73 million   in cash plus a working capital adjustment.  CTG-AM, formerly operated as H.C. Materials, is the market leading designer and manufacturer of single crystal piezoelectric materials, serving major original equipment manufacturers throughout the medical marketplace.  These materials enable high definition ultrasound imaging (3D and 4D), as well as intravascular ultrasound applications.  Other applications for these materials include wireless pacemakers, implantable hearing aids, and defense technologies. 
    
  With the CTG-AM acquisition, CTS gains technology and proprietary manufacturing methods that expand its offering of piezoelectric materials.  This allows CTS to become the leading large-scale commercial producer of both single crystal materials and traditional piezoelectric ceramics.  
  The purchase price of    $73,063  , net of cash acquired of    $4  , has been allocated to the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as of  March 11, 2016.

NOTE 18   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  ASU 2016-15   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments".  This ASU reduces the diversity in reporting of eight specific cash flow issues due to accounting guidance that is unclear or does not exist.  The eight issues relate to certain debt activities, business combination activities, insurance settlements and other various activities.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied retrospectively using a transition method for each period presented.  An entity that elects early adoption of the amendment under this ASU must adopt all aspects of the amendment in the same period.  This guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU 2016-9   "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting"  
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods.  Early adoption is permitted. An entity that elects early adoption of the amendment under this ASU must adopt all aspects of the amendment in the same period.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU 2016-5   "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships" 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-5 "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships".   This amendment clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument does not on its own require dedesignation of the hedging instrument under Topic 815, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria (including those in paragraphs 815-20-35-14 through 35-18) continue to be met.  This update can be applied prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.  This update is not expected to have an impact to our financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-2   "Leases (Topic 842)"  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, "Leases (Topic 842)".  This amendment created a new Topic under the accounting standards codification to account for the provisions of the ASU.  This amendment is meant to provide transparency and to improve comparability between entities.  The ASU requires companies to record an asset and liability to the balance sheet for leases that were formerly designated as operating leases as well as leases designated as financing leases.  The provisions of the ASU predominately change the recognition of leases for lessees, the provisions do not substantially change the accounting for lessors.  This ASU will supersede the provisions of Topic 840 Leases. 
  The liability recorded for a lease is meant to recognize the lease payments and the asset as a right to use the underlying asset for the lease, including optional periods if it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised.  Recording of the liability should be based on the present value of the lease payments.  If a lease term is less than twelve month, a company is allowed to elect not to record the asset and liability.  Expense related to these leases are to be amortized straight-line over the term of the lease. 
  Additionally, the provisions of this ASU provide additional guidance on separating lease terms from maintenance and other type of provisions that provide a good or service, accounting for sale-leaseback provisions, and leveraged leases.   
  Reporting in the cash flow statement remains virtually unchanged.  Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required. 
  These updates are required to be applied under a modified retrospective approach from the beginning of the earlier period presented.  The modified approach provides optional practical expedients that may be elected, which will allow companies to continue to account for leases under the previous guidance for leases that commenced prior to the effective date. 
  The provisions of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those periods.  Early adoption is allowed.  The provisions of this guidance are still being evaluated and the impact on CTS' financial statements has not yet been determined. 
  ASU 2015-17,    Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  
  In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes".      The amendment requires Company's to begin classifying all deferred income taxes as non-current.  The provisions are expected  
  
   27 

Table of Contents  

to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and align the presentation of deferred income taxes with the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").  The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The update can be applied prospectively or retrospectively.  
  The Company early adopted the above guidance on January 1, 2016 and elected to retrospectively apply its provisions.  This resulted in reclassification of the amounts in our December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet as shown in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation. 
  ASU 2015-16,    Business Combinations (Topic 805):  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  
  In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805) Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments of Inventory".  The amendments clarify that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The acquirer needs to record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income as a result of the change to the provisional amounts as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  This amendment requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item, as if the provisional adjustments had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  This ASU became effective for CTS on January 1, 2016 and its provisions did not have an impact on our financial statements.   
  ASU 2015-14  , "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Accounting for Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ".    The amended guidance deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers     (Topic 606)  "   to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period.   Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that annual period.  In addition, in April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (Topic 606)", which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for intellectual property licenses.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (Topic 606)", which provides additional guidance in assessing whether a transaction meets the definition of revenue, in narrowed circumstances during the transition to ASU 2014-09 and subsequent to implementation.  This update can either be applied under either a cumulative effect or retrospective method.  ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 must be adopted concurrently with ASU 2014-09.  The impact of ASU 2014-9 on our financial statements has not yet been determined.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and     Results of Operations ( MD A ) 
  (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts) 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included under Item 1, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Overview 
  CTS Corporation ( CTS ,  we ,  our  or  us ) is a leading designer and manufacturer of products that Sense, Connect and Move.  CTS manufactures sensors, actuators and electronic components in North America, Europe, and Asia, and supplies these products to OEMs in the aerospace, communications, defense, industrial, information technology, medical and transportation markets. 
  Results of Operations:   Third   Quarter   2016   versus   Third   Quarter   2015    
    
  The following table highlights changes in significant components of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  : 

(1) Cost of goods sold includes restructuring related charges of   $  0   in   2016   and   $152   in   2015  . 
    
  Sales of   $99,697   in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased   $9,051   or   10.0%   from the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Sales to automotive markets increased $3,173 driven by higher volumes which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact.  Other sales increased $5,878 due to the addition of sales from the single crystal acquisition and higher demand for electronic components in certain end markets.  Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced sales by $600 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of automotive products. 
  Gross margin as a percent of sales was   36.8%   in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   34.7%   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  The increase in gross margin resulted from cost savings from continued efficiency gains, material and labor productivity projects, savings from restructuring projects, favorable mix, and the addition of sales from the single crystal acquisition.  In addition, foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on manufacturing costs primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Mexican Peso. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $16,048   or   16.1%   of sales in the   third   quarter of 2016 versus   $12,689   or   14.0%   of sales in the comparable quarter of 2015.  The increase is primarily attributable to added costs as a result of the single crystal

acquisition, including amortization of intangibles, and the timing of certain expenses. In addition, CTS paid an early termination fee related to its leased facility in Lisle, Illinois in anticipation of a move in the 2017/2018 time frame to another leased facility in the same area, which will consolidate the Bolingbrook and Lisle, Illinois sites into one facility and reduce ongoing expenses. 
  Research and development expenses were   $6,284   or   6.3%   of sales in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   $5,692   or   6.3%   of sales in the comparable quarter of 2015.  The increase was related to continued investment in new products to drive organic growth. Research and development expenses are focused on expanded applications of existing products and new product development as well as current product and process enhancements.  
  A non-recurring environmental charge of $14,541 was recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to a site in Asheville, North Carolina. The charge recorded included both the interim remediation proposed by CTS and accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and anticipated future remediation and monitoring. 
  Restructuring and impairment charges were   $1,969   or   2.0%   of sales in the   third   quarter 2016 compared to   $2,373    or   2.6%   of sales in the second quarter  of 2015.  The 2016 charges are for severance costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan announced in June 2016. The 2015 charges consist primarily of severance, transition and shutdown costs related to the consolidation of CTS' Canadian operation in Streetsville, Ontario into other CTS facilities. 
  Operating earnings were   $12,490   or   12.5%   of sales in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to an operating loss of   $3,850   or   (4.2)%   of sales in the comparable quarter of 2015 as a result of the items discussed above. 
  Other income and expense items are summarized in the following table:   

  Interest expense increased in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015 as a result of higher borrowings related to the single crystal acquisition.  Interest income decreased due to lower cash balances.  Other expense in the third quarter of 2015  was driven by foreign currency translation losses, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi. 

CTS' effective income tax rate was   68.3%   and   31.2%   in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 reflected an increase in valuation allowances recorded against certain state net operating losses and tax credits and the revaluation of U.S. deferred taxes as a result of the June 2016 restructuring activities discussed in Note 7.  The rate also reflects an increase in a valuation allowance on certain non-U.S. losses as a result of changes in the expectation of CTS' ability to utilize those losses, changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, various other discrete items, CTS' decision to no longer permanently reinvest the earnings of its Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, and tax expense for withholding taxes on earnings in China that are not anticipated to be maintained in China.  CTS began recording tax expense for withholding taxes in China in the fourth quarter of 2015 and expects to continue this practice going forward.

Results of Operations:   Nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   Nine months ended September 27, 2015    
    
  The following table highlights changes in significant components of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  : 

(1) Cost of goods sold includes restructuring related charges of   $  0   in   2016   and   $444   in   2015  . 
    
  Sales of   $295,095   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $6,067   or   2.1%   from the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  .  Sales to automotive markets increased $1,712 driven by higher volumes which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact.  Other sales increased $4,355 due to the addition of sales from the single crystal acquisition which were partially offset by lower demand for electronic components in certain end markets. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced sales by $1,697 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of automotive products.  
  Gross margin as a percent of sales was   35.4%   in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   33.5%   in the first   nine   months of 2015. The increase in gross margin resulted from cost savings from continued efficiency gains, material and labor productivity projects, savings from restructuring projects, favorable mix, and the addition of sales from the single crystal acquisition.  In addition, foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on manufacturing costs primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Mexican Peso. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $46,459   or   15.8%   of sales in the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   versus   $43,623   or   15.1%   of sales in the comparable year-to-date period in   2015  .  Expenses in 2016 include added costs as a result of the single crystal acquisition, including amortization of intangibles. In addition, CTS paid an early termination fee related to its leased facility in Lisle, Illinois in anticipation of a move in the 2017/2018 time frame to another leased facility in the same area, which will consolidate the Bolingbrook and Lisle, Illinois sites into one facility and reduce ongoing expenses. 
  Research and development expenses were   $18,414   or   6.2%   of sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $16,378   or   5.7%   of sales in the comparable prior year period.  The increase was related to continued investment in new products to drive organic growth.  Research and development expenses are focused on expanded applications of existing products and new product development as well as current product and process enhancements.  
  A non-recurring environmental charge of $14,541 was recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to a site in Asheville, North Carolina. The charge recorded included both the interim remediation proposed by CTS and accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and anticipated future remediation and monitoring.

Restructuring and impairment charges were   $2,175   or   0.7%   of sales in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   $5,229   or   1.8%   of sales in the first half of 2015. The 2016 charges are for severance costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan announced in June 2016. The 2015 charges consist primarily of severance, transition and shutdown costs related to the consolidation of CTS' Canadian operation in Streetsville, Ontario into other CTS facilities.  The information as set forth under Note 7, Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring Activities, in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. 
  The gain on sale of assets is driven primarily by the gain on sale of the building in Canada in June 2016. 
  Operating earnings were   $49,020   or   16.6%   of sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to operating earnings of   $17,182   or   5.9%   of sales in the   nine months ended September 27, 2015   as a result of the items discussed above.  
  Other income and expense items are summarized in the following table:   

  Interest expense increased in the first   nine   months of 2016 versus the   nine   months of 2015 as a result of higher borrowings related to the single crystal acquisition.  Interest income decreased due to lower cash balances.  Other expense in the first   nine   months of 2016 is largely the result of foreign currency translation losses, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi.  Other expense in the first   nine   months of 2015 was also driven by foreign currency translation losses, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi, Euro and Canadian Dollar. 

CTS' effective income tax rate was   43.2%   and   (59.2)%   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax rate in the first nine months of 2016 reflected an increase in valuation allowances recorded against certain state net operating losses and tax credits and the revaluation of U.S. deferred taxes as a result of the June 2016 restructuring activities discussed in Note 7.  The rate also reflects an increase in a valuation allowance on certain non-U.S. losses as a result of changes in the expectation of CTS' ability to utilize those losses, changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, various other discrete items, CTS' decision to no longer permanently reinvest the earnings of its Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, and tax expense for withholding taxes on earnings in China that are not anticipated to be maintained in China.  CTS began recording tax expense for withholding taxes in China in the fourth quarter of 2015 and expects to continue this practice going forward.  During the first nine months of 2015, CTS reflected a benefit attributable to filing amended U.S. federal tax returns in order to take credits for foreign taxes paid which was partially offset by a reserve recorded on an uncertain tax position. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $114,433   at   September 30, 2016   and   $156,928   at   December 31, 2015  , of which $113,359 and $156,310, respectively, were held outside the United States.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of   $42,495   was primarily driven by cash used in investing activities of   $75,282  , which included a payment for a business acquisition in the amount of   $73,063  , capital expenditures of   $14,467   and offset by net borrowings on our credit facility of   $5,300   proceeds from the sale of assets of   $12,248  , and cash generated from operations of   $31,587  .  Total debt was    $96,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $90,700   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as the sum of long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders' equity, was   23.9%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   24.4%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Working capital decreased by   $35,626   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in cash and cash equivalents.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $31,587   during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of   $26,070  , depreciation and amortization expense of   $14,010  , and equity-based compensation of   $1,759   offset by amortization of retirement benefit adjustments of   $1,188  , net changes in assets and liabilities of   $8,055  , and other non-cash items such as gains on sales of fixed assets, deferred income taxes, and restructuring charges of   $1,009  . 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $  75,282  , which includes a payment for a business acquisition of   $73,063  , net of cash acquired, $  14,467   for capital expenditures and offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of   $12,248  . 
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $2,073  . These cash inflows were the result of net borrowings under our credit facility totaling   $5,300   and windfall tax benefits from equity awards of   $696   which were partially offset by dividend payments of $  3,923  . 
  Capital Resources 
  Long term debt was comprised of the following:    

On August 10, 2015, CTS entered into a new   five  -year credit agreement ( Revolving Credit Facility ) with a group of banks in order to support CTS  financing needs.  The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided for a credit line of   $200,000  .  On May 23, 2016, CTS requested and received a   $100,000   increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under its existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from   $200,000   to   $300,000  .  
  The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.  Failure of CTS to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.  CTS was in compliance with all debt covenants at   September 30, 2016  .  
  CTS uses interest rate swaps to convert the revolving credit facility s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate. In the second quarter of 2012, CTS entered into   four   separate interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on   $50,000   of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017.  In the third quarter of 2012, CTS entered into   four   additional interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on   $25,000   of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2016, CTS entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020.  The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled. 
  Generally, CTS' practice and intention is to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries outside the U.S.  However, CTS determined during 2015 that as a result of changes in the business, the foreign earnings of its subsidiaries in Canada and the U.K. were no longer permanently reinvested.  Therefore, a provision for the expected taxes on repatriation of those earnings was recorded at that time  .  Any repatriation may not result in significant cash income tax payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available tax credits, resulting in no significant net cash taxes being incurred.  CTS does not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently reinvested.   
  We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.  We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings  
  
   33 

Table of Contents  

under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of CTS under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we used are reasonable, based upon the information available. 
  Our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements.  The following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating CTS' reported financial results. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met: (1) we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer, which generally happens at the point of shipment, provided that no significant obligations remain; (3) the price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: 
             
    Credit reviews of all new customer accounts, 
                
    Ongoing credit evaluations of current customers, 
                
    Credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information, 
                
    Adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, 
                
    An active collection effort by regional credit functions, reporting directly to the corporate financial officers, and 
     We reserve for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Over the last three years, accounts receivable reserves have been approximately 0.2% to 0.3% of total accounts receivable. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience. 
  Inventories 
  We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or the current estimated market value.  We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements. 
  Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 17.5% to 20.4% of gross inventory. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories. 
  Retirement Plans 
  Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation.  We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.  After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation.  During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted.  Changes in the actuarial assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations. 
  Valuation of Goodwill 
  Goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: 
             
    Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value, 
                
    Significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, 
     
   34 

Table of Contents  

Adverse action or assessment by a regulator, 
                
    Unanticipated competition, 
                
    More-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, 
                
    Testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, and 
                
    Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed. 
     If CTS believes that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using two valuation methods: "Income Approach   Discounted Cash Flow Method" and "Market Approach   Guideline Public Company Method". The approach defined below is based upon our last impairment test conducted as of October 1, 2015. 
  Under the "Income Approach   Discounted Cash Flow Method", the key assumptions consider sales, cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year 2020.  These assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues, operating expenses, and gross margin assumptions.  The fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates, current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment.  If our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect, our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment. 
  Under the "Market Approach   Guideline Public Company Method", we identified eight publicly traded companies, including CTS, which we believe have significant relevant similarities.  For these eight companies, we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to EBITDA. Similar to the Income approach discussed above, sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized.  The market prices of CTS and other guideline company shares are also key assumptions. If these market prices increase, the estimated market value would increase.  If the market prices decrease, the estimated market value would decrease. 
  The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management's determination.  The Market approach is based upon historical and current economic conditions, which might not reflect the long-term prospects or opportunities for CTS' business being evaluated. 
  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, which involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. 
  There have not been any significant changes to our impairment testing methodology other than updates to the assumptions to reflect the current market environment.  As discussed above, key assumptions used in the first step of the goodwill impairment test were determined by management utilizing CTS' internal operating plan. The key assumptions utilized include forecasted growth rates for revenues and operating expenses as well as a discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates of capital, current market interest rates and the evaluation of a risk premium relevant to the business segment. CTS will monitor future results and will perform a test if indicators trigger an impairment review. 
  We test the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Based upon our latest assessment, we determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2015, and there have been no further indicators of goodwill impairment since that time. 
  Valuation of Long-Lived and Other Intangible Assets 
  We evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of: 
             
    Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, 
                
    Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, 
                
    Significant negative industry or economic trends, 
                
    Significant decline in CTS' stock price for a sustained period, and 
                
    Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. 
     
   35 

Table of Contents  

If CTS believes that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test failed in the case of amortizable assets, it measures impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows.   
  Income Taxes 
  CTS identified, evaluated, and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions. Included in deferred tax assets are amounts related to federal, state and foreign net operating losses.  CTS intends to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income taxes. 
  CTS' practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. 
  CTS earns a significant amount of its operating income outside of the U.S., which is generally deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions.    However, CTS determined during 2015 that as a result of changes in the business, the foreign earnings of its subsidiaries in Canada and the U.K. were no longer permanently reinvested.  Therefore, a provision for the expected taxes on repatriation of those earnings was recorded  . CTS does not intend to repatriate funds beyond the amount from its Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries; however, should CTS require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations, CTS could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances.  Repatriation would result in a higher effective tax rate. Borrowing in the U.S. would result in increased interest expense. 
  Significant Customers 
  Our net sales to customers representing at least 10% of total net sales were as follows:
