1.   

Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business 

Good Gaming, Inc, (Formerly HDS International Corp). (the "Company") was incorporated on November 3, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is a leading tournament gaming platform and online destination targeting the over 205 million eSports players and participants worldwide that want to compete at the high school or college level.   A substantial portion of the Company's activities has involved developing a business plan and establishing contacts and visibility in the marketplace and the Company has not generated any revenue to date. 

On February 18, 2016, the Company acquired Good Gaming, Inc. from CMG Holdings Group, Inc. (OTCQB: CMGO).   

Going Concern  

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has generated no revenues to date and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $749,770 and an accumulated deficit of 3,659,451. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

2.   

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

(a)   

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The financial statements for the periods ending September 30, 2016  include the accounts of the Company.   

(b)   

These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in US dollars. The Company's fiscal year-end is December 31. 

(c)   

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the fair values of convertible debentures, derivative liability, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 

(d)   

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

(e)   

Intangible Assets 

Intangible  assets are carried at the purchased cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally from fifteen to twenty years.

2.   

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

(f)   

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 

(g)   

Beneficial Conversion Features 

From time to time, the Company may issue convertible notes that may contain an embedded beneficial conversion feature. A beneficial conversion feature exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of the warrants, if related warrants have been granted. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is recorded as a debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method. 

(h)   

Derivative Liability 

From time to time, the Company may issue equity instruments that may contain an embedded derivative instrument which may result in a derivative liability. A derivative liability exists on the date the equity instrument is issued when there is a contingent exercise provision. The derivative liability is records at is fair value calculated by using an option pricing model such as a multi-nominal lattice model. The fair value of the derivative liability is then calculated on each balance sheet date with the corresponding gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. 

(i)   

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share 

The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share,  which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive  potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

(j)   

Income Taxes 

Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for  net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these financial  statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. 

(k)   

Comprehensive Loss 

ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income  , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no items that represent comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements. 

(l)   

Financial Instruments 

ASC 820,  "Fair Value Measurements"  and ASC 825,  Financial Instruments,  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Level 1 

Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 

Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3 

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were presented on the Company's balance sheet as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as follows: 

(m)   

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

3.   

Other Assets 

The Company valued the software purchased at $1,200,000 at purchase date February 18, 2016.  The software has a useful life of 5 years.  Amortization for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 is calculated at $150,000. 

Convertible Debentures 

(a) 

On April 15, 2015, the Company entered into a $100,000 convertible debenture with a non-related party. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015 The Company received the first $50,000 payment.  The remaining $50,000 payment will be made at the request of the borrower.  No additional payments have been made as of March 31, 2016.  Under the terms of the debenture, the amount is unsecured, bears interest at 10% per annum, and is due on October 16, 2016. The note is convertible into shares of common stock any time after the maturity date at a conversion rate of 50% of the average of the five lowest closing bid prices of the Company's common stock for the thirty trading days ending one trading day prior to the date the conversion notice is sent by the holder to the Company. For the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded accrued interest of $2,520 (December, 31, 2015 $3,894), which has been included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  The lender has agreed to sell this investment to the Company or to an investor of the Company s choosing at face value plus interest.

Convertible Debentures (continued)  

(b)  

On April 1, 2015, we entered into a transaction with Iconic Holdings, LLC (the "Purchaser"), whereby Iconic Holdings agreed to provide up to $600,000 through a structured convertible promissory note (the "Note"), with funds to be received in tranches. The note bears interest of 10% and is due April 1, 2016. The initial proceeds of $40,000 was received on April 9, 2015, with $30,000 remitted and delivered to us, $4,000 retained by the Purchaser as an original issue discount, and $6,000 retained by the Purchaser for legal expenses.  In February 2016 as part of a settlement between the lender and the Company, the note along with a remaining balance of $8300 from former JABRO-Asher notes were restructured to a principle amount of $25,000 with a due date of June 18, 2017 and a 0% interest rate.  The lender is subject to strict lock-up and leak-out provisions.  Additionally, as part of the February 2016 settlement with the lender, the lender funded $100,000 new debentures due August 2018 bearing 0% interest with the lender subject to strict lock-up and leak-out provisions.  The Company has negotiated the lock-up of these debentures from conversion into common stock for a period of one-year commencing. 

(c)   

As  part of the asset purchase agreement between HDS International Corp. and CMG Holdings Group, Inc., SirenGPS was issued a $60,000 0% interest convertible debenture that matures in August 2018.     The debentures are convertible into common stock at a 20% discount to the 20-day moving average of the Company s common stock after a period of seven months.  The debt is subject to strict lock-up and leak-out provisions.  SirenGPS has agreed to sell this security to the Company or to an investor of the Company s choosing at face value. 

(d)   

On or around April 7, 2016, Silver Linings Management, LLC funded the Company $13,439.50 in the form of convertible debentures secured by certain high-powered gaming machines purchased from XIDAX.  The notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum payable in cash or kind at the option of the Company, mature April 1, 2018, and are convertible into Series B Preferred shares at the option of the holder at any time.  

The Company did not allocate to equity any increase in note value due to the fact that the conversion value was lower than the par value.  Thereby creating a zero or negative value. 

5.   

Derivative Liabilities 

The following inputs and assumptions were used to value the convertible debentures outstanding during the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following inputs and assumptions were used to value the convertible debentures outstanding during the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The projected annual volatility for each valuation period was based on the historic volatility of the Company of 165% as at December 31, 2015, 167% as at February 6, 2016, 167% as at February 10, 2016, 168% as at February 13, 2016, 168% as at February 18, 2016, 168% as at

Common Stock 

Share Transactions for the Quarter Ended Septrmber 30, 2016: 

On August 16, 2016,  the Company exchanged 1.15MM Series B Preferred Shares with an investor for 179,450,000 common shares which were retired into treasury.  These common shares were pledged to Iconic Holdings, LLC contractually as collateral against a $25,000 convertible debenture that was restructured in February 2016.  By agreement, the lender converted a portion of this note into common shares eliminating debt from the Company s balance sheet.  The Company has agreed to deliver an additional 70,050,000 common shares to the lender by year-end 2016, which will eliminate the debenture in its entirety.  Iconic Holdings has agreed to lock-up a $100,000 convertible debenture for a period of one-year effective June 10, 2016, subject to strict covenants that will protect common shareholders from significant dilution.  The net effect of this Agreement is that the common share float of the Company has not been increased and that shareholders will not be negatively impacted by a common stock increase and additional dilution.   

On August 31,  2016 Iconic Holdings converted $6,250 of convertible debt into 62,250,000 shares of the Company s common stock  

7.   

Preferred Stock 

Our Articles of Incorporation, which were amended effective July 22, 2016, authorize us to issue up to 450,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value. Of the 450,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, the total number of shares of Class A Preferred Shares the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is Two Hundred Forty Nine Million, Nine Hundred Ninety Nine Thousand (249,999,000), with a stated par value of $0.001 per share, and the total number of shares of Class B Preferred Shares the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is Two Hundred Million (200,000,000), with a stated par value of $0.001 per share, and the total number of newly authorized Class C Preferred Shares the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is One Thousand (1,000). Our Board of Directors is authorized, without further action by the shareholders, to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the designations, number, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms. We believe that the Board of Directors' power to set the terms of, and our ability to issue, preferred stock will provide flexibility in connection with possible financing or acquisition transactions in the future. The issuance of preferred stock, however, could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and decrease the amount of any liquidation distribution to such holders. The presence of outstanding preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.  

As of September 30, 2016, we had 7,500,000 shares of our Class A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. 

The 7,500,000 issued and outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of common stock at a rate of 20 common shares for each one Class A Preferred Share. The 153,998,873 issued and outstanding shares of Class B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of common stock at a rate of 200 common shares for each one Class B Preferred Share. The 1,000 issued and outstanding shares of Class C Preferred Stock are are not convertible . They are Voting preferred shares If all of our Class A Preferred Stock, Class B Preferred Stock and Class C Preferred Stock was converted into shares of common stock, the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock will increase by 4,489,774,600 shares. 

On August 16, 2016 the Company issued 130,300,000 share of series B preferred stock.  86,650,000 shares were issued for the purchase of Good Gaming software, 1,150,000 shares were issued in exchange for 179,450,000 shares of commons stock and 42,500,000 shares were issued for stock subscriptions receivable.

These shares due are currently in the form of a subscription payable by HDS International to CMG Holdings Group.

Overview  

Good Gaming, Inc. (the "Company", "we", or "us") was  incorporated November 3, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in providing certain business services.   

On February 18, 2016, the Company, gormerly HDS International Corp., acquired Good Gaming, Inc. from CMG Holdings Group, Inc. (OTCQB: CMGO).  On that date, the Company s former CEO, Paul Rauner, resigned. And the Company appointed Vik Grover to the positions of CEO and Director. Vik Grover is a former Wall Street analyst and investment banker with 20 years' experience in telecommunications, media and technology.  In addition, Barbara Laken and David Dorwart were elected by the majority shareholders to the Company's Board of Directors.  Ms. Laken is a former teacher, with experience creating specialized formats for advanced placement and special needs programs, with emphasis on systems management and curriculum development. A published novelist and co-author of an optioned screenplay. Mr. Dorwart is the Co-Founder and Chairman of Assist Wireless, Inc., a provider of lifeline wireless services to tens of thousands of subscribers primarily in the Midwest.   

On May 4, 2016 the Company announced that it has completed its first closed public beta testing of their 2.0 tournament platform to determine the functionality, speed, ease of use, and accuracy of the system and are preparing to enter into full-blown production.   

The Good Gaming platform was established in early 2014 by the founding members who had recognized the need that hundreds of millions of gamers worldwide have a desire to play games at a competitive level.  The founders recognized that while professional eSports was quickly establishing itself, there were no structure or organizations on a large scale for amateur gamers.   

Good Gaming is effectively building the equivalent infrastructure of High School and College Athletics for the rapidly growing eSports industry.  Good Gaming is designed to be the gateway for amateur eSports athletes to compete at the semi-professional level, improve their gaming skills, and interact with veteran gamers globally in a destination site and social networking framework.   

Good Gaming differs from the professional level of eSports industries by focusing on the 205 million plus gamers that fall below the professional level and above the casual gamer, classified as  amateurs .  Good Gaming also differs from other direct and indirect competitors by being the first to offer multi-game, multi-console services at the amateur eSports level.  The Company is not exclusive to any one vendor of hardware or software titles.   

Good Gaming held one of the largest pay-to-play online tournaments in history in December 2014 based on Activision Blizzard s title  Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft .  The tournament attracted 300,000 unique visitors, over 1,250+ paying members and increased overall memberships in Good Gaming from 1,000 to over 15,000 members.  In 2015, the Company spent an entire year refining its platform and preparing for a more sustainable business plan that could infinitely scale.  In 2016, the Company completed its 2.0 tournament platform and, as a result, has run dozens of robotic internal test tournaments and held numerous free-to-play tournaments of increasing size with its partner, The Syndicate, the owner of the world s longest running online gaming guild with 1,200 members worldwide.  Good Gaming also conducted two closed public beta tournaments of hundreds of participants in May 2016 in order to fully vet the system.  After making roughly 100 fixes and changes to the system, it now runs flawlessly.  The system is designed to scale to 512,000 concurrent competitors.  The       Company is currently updating the system to handle team tournaments, which will further expand its opportunity to popular titles that have tens of millions of active players and to recently launched titles that have the potential for cross-platform play between Gaming PC, Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.

Technology    

With Good Gaming s proprietary technology platform, which is based on the infinitely scalable and stress tested Yii framework geared for Web 2.0 development, Good Gaming will be able to offer publishers and vendors an innovative approach to gaming interactions.  Currently there is no way for gamers to barter their skills and labor on the open market in a non-fragmented and less cumbersome process.  As competitive gaming reaches critical mass, how gamers interact and barter their skills and labor will become critical if not the most economically lucrative endeavor.  The  gamers  economy it expected to grow from tens of millions of dollars every year to multiple billions of dollars and the Good Gaming founders believe that we are rapidly approaching that time.    

We have developed a proprietary app that will revolutionize Blizzard s game of Hearthstone competitively, which is the main title that we run for tournaments today.  When players face each other off in duels so far the Conquest and Last Hero Standing formats were used, which both have flaws. Our app will introduce the new and better "Strike" format to the 50-60 million people that play Hearthstone worldwide, so we think this app, if it takes off, can drive millions and tens of millions of unique visitors to the GG website.  We will require people to come to our site every time they want to use the app. The model is still being discussed internally, but the bottom line   is this app has the potential to take GG viral this winter and massively accelerate our model ahead of the BASE CASE we have shared with investors (e.g., we look for 5MM unique visitors in month 36). 

Good Gaming s platform is modular and allows for easy integration of third party applications as well as tight integration into other existing systems.  This framework allows for clans/teams/guilds to add functionality over time to include running their own tournaments leveraging the viral nature of the online communities.  The Company is offering social networking functionality so gamers can interact, track each other, and communicate.  Good Gaming also is completing a content suite to offer videos, blogs, and forums.  Additionally, the Company intends to host multiple games online that subscribers to the site can play for free or for fees depending on their Good Gaming status/player level.    

Good Gaming has one patent filed for an online currency barter system (Mercenary System) that allows gamers across multiple games and multiple consoles the ability to trade items and labor in an efficient manner. The Company intends to file a patent for its 2.0 framework later this year, as it is based on proprietary coding that can handle more scope and scale than the legacy 1.0 patent filing.  The market for these transactions will grow from a few hundred million dollars in 2014 to tens of billions of dollars by 2018.    

The Company intends to complete the 2.0 site during spring 2016, which will then allow it to go live offering pay-to-play and free-to-play tournaments for cash and prizes and offer gamers the premiere destination site for amateur eSports worldwide.  In 2016, the Company intends to perfect is B2C model targeting gamers directly.  In 2017, Good Gaming intends to launch a B2B program so other groups, including colleges, restaurants, bars et al. can offer their own tournaments using its platform.  The Company also intends to work on a 3.0 system that will integrate with mobile networks and offer additional features to its customers.    

Our goal is to become  a leading tournament gaming platform and online destination targeting the over 205 million eSports players and participants worldwide that want to compete at the high school or college level.    We are a developmental stage business, have not generated any revenues to date and have a history of operating losses.  

Certain statements contained below are forward-looking statements (rather than historical facts) that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.   

We are considered a start-up corporation. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Going Concern  

We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from our future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern .   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We will continue to rely on debentures, preferred stock and/or common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally  accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 3.      
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from the fact that the area in which we do business is highly competitive and constantly evolving. The market in which we do business is highly competitive and constantly evolving. We face competition from the larger and more established companies, from companies that have greater resources, including but not limited to, more money, and greater ability to expand their markets also cut into our potential customers. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial strength, nationwide advertising coverage and other resources that we do not have.    

ITEM 4.      
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures(as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the "Exchange Act"), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the lack of segregation of duties and lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weakness relates to the lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by an external consultant with no oversight by a professional with accounting expertise.  Our CEO/CFO does not possess accounting expertise and our company does not have an audit committee.  This weakness is due to the company's lack of working capital to hire additional staff.  To remedy this material weakness, we intend to engage another accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our first quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
