UNITED COMMUNITY BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION - United Community Bancorp, a federal
corporation ( old United Community Bancorp ) completed its previously announced conversion from the mutual holding
company form of organization to the stock holding company form on January 9, 2013. As a result of the conversion, United Community
Bancorp, an Indiana corporation ( United Community Bancorp  or  Company ), became the holding company
for United Community Bank ( Bank ), and United Community MHC and old United Community Bancorp, ceased to exist. As
part of the conversion, all outstanding shares of old United Community Bancorp common stock (other than those owned by United
Community MHC) were converted into the right to receive 0.6573 of a share of United Community Bancorp common stock. 

The Company, through the Bank, operates
in a single business segment providing traditional banking services through its office and branches in southeastern Indiana. UCB
Real Estate Management Holding, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. The entity was formed for the purpose of holding
assets that are acquired by the Bank through, or in lieu of, foreclosure. UCB Financial Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Bank, was formed for a variety of purposes, but was primarily being used for the collection of commissions from a wealth
management partner. In addition to the collection of commissions, during the prior fiscal year, the Bank applied for, and received
approval from the OCC to allow UCB Financial Services, Inc. to own and manage a portion of the Bank s municipal bond portfolio. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
were prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and therefore do not include
all information or footnotes necessary for complete financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. However, all normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for
a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. No other adjustments have been included. The results for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2017. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2016, which are included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016. 

The Company evaluates events and transactions occurring subsequent
to the date of the financial statements for matters requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. 

2.      EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ( ESOP )  
As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the ESOP owned 173,894 shares of the Company s common stock. The shares owned
by the ESOP are held in a suspense account until released for allocation to participants. 

3.      EARNINGS PER SHARE ( EPS )   Non-vested
shares with non-forfeitable dividend rights are considered participating securities and, thus, subject to the two-class method
pursuant to ASC 260,  Earnings per Share,  when computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company s restricted
share awards contain non-forfeitable dividend rights but do not contractually obligate the holders to share in the losses of the
Company. Accordingly, during periods of net income, unvested restricted shares are included in the determination of both basic
and diluted EPS. During periods of net loss, these shares are excluded from both basic and diluted EPS. 

Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common
shares and unvested restricted shares outstanding, adjusted for ESOP shares not yet committed to be released. Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options,
were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effects of contracts or securities exercisable
or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. For the three months ended September
30, 2016 outstanding options to purchase 227,626 shares were excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share as their
effect would have been anti-dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted weighted average number of common
shares outstanding: 

4.      STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   The Company applies
the provisions of ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments and to recognize this cost in the financial statements over the
period during which the employee is required to provide such services. The Company has elected to recognize compensation cost
associated with its outstanding stock-based compensation awards with graded vesting on a straight-line basis pursuant to ASC 718.
The expense is calculated for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expense associated
with restricted stock awards is calculated based upon the value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation
expense was $63,000 and $65,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No stock-based compensation
awards were granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

5.      DIVIDENDS   On August 11, 2016 the Board of Directors
of the Company declared cash dividends on the Company s outstanding shares of stock of $0.06 per share for each period.
The dividend, totaling $252,000, was paid during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

6.      STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN     On February 3,
2014 the Company s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 514,956 shares of the Company s outstanding
common stock, which represented approximately 10% of the Company s outstanding shares at that date. Purchases were conducted
solely through and based upon the parameters of a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2014, all 514,956 shares were
repurchased at a total cost of $6.0 million. 

Additionally, on May 18, 2015, the Company s Board of
Directors approved the repurchase of up to 231,571 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock, which was approximately
5% of the Company s outstanding shares as of May 18, 2015. Purchases were conducted solely through and based upon the parameters
of a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan. As of June 30, 2016, 231,571 were repurchased at a total cost of $3.4 million. 

On November 6, 2015, United Community Bancorp entered into
a Stock Repurchase Agreement with Stilwell Activist Fund, L.P., Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P. and Stilwell Partners, L.P.
(collectively, the  Sellers ).  Pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Agreement, the Company purchased 318,756 shares
of its common stock, $0.01 par value, from the Sellers for an aggregate purchase price of $4,781,340, or $15.00 per share. 
The repurchase was funded with cash on hand and completed the 5% repurchase program mentioned above. Following the repurchase
transaction, the Company had 4,201,326 shares of common stock outstanding. On April 26, 2016 the Company purchased 3,183 shares
of common stock from participants in the equity incentive plan. There were no other repurchases after this date and therefore
at September 30, 2016, there were 4,198,143 shares of common stock outstanding. 

Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2016, on November
4, 2016, United Community Bancorp approved the repurchase of up to 209,907 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock,
which was approximately 5% of the Company s outstanding shares as of November 4, 2016. Purchases will be conducted solely
through and based upon the parameters of a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan.

     $          
     $        

8.       DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
- ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, both
assets and liabilities, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate the
value. For financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using present value or
other valuation methods. 

The following methods and assumptions are used in estimating
the fair values of financial instruments: 

Cash and cash equivalents  

The carrying values presented in the consolidated statements
of position approximate fair value. 

Investments and mortgage-backed securities  

For investment securities (debt instruments) and mortgage-backed
securities, fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value
is estimated using quoted market prices of comparable instruments. 

Loans receivable  

The fair value of the loan portfolio is estimated by evaluating
homogeneous categories of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by types, such as residential mortgage,
commercial real estate, and consumer. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest, terms,
and by performing and non-performing categories. The fair value of performing loans, except residential mortgage loans, is calculated
by discounting contractual cash flows using estimated market discount rates which reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent
in the loan. For performing residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted
for prepayment estimates using discount rates based on secondary market sources. The fair value for significant non-performing
loans is based on recent internal or external appraisals. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flow, and discount rates are
judgmentally determined by using available market information. 

Federal Home Loan Bank stock  

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system and
is required to maintain an investment based upon a pre-determined formula. The carrying values presented in the consolidated statements
of position approximate fair value. 

Deposits  

The fair values of passbook accounts, NOW accounts, and money
market savings and demand deposits approximate their carrying values. The fair values of fixed maturity certificates of deposit
are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar maturities. 

Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank  

The fair value is calculated using rates available to the Company
on advances with similar terms and remaining maturities. 

Off-balance sheet items  

Carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These
instruments are generally variable rate or short-term in nature, with minimal fees charged. 

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial
instruments at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are as follows: 

ASC 820-10-50-2 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 
     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2 
     Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
    quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level 3 
     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
    to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  

Fair value methods and assumptions are set forth below for
each type of financial instrument. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1
of the valuation hierarchy.  Level 2 securities include U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S.
Government agency bonds, municipal securities, and other real estate owned. If quoted market prices are not available, the Bank
utilizes a third party vendor to calculate the fair value of its available for sale securities. The third party vendor uses quoted
prices of securities with similar characteristics when available.  If such quotes are not available, the third party
vendor uses pricing models or discounted cash flow models with observable inputs to determine the fair value of these securities. 

Fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 

The adjustments to other real estate owned and impaired loans
are based primarily on appraisals of the real estate  ,   cash
flow analysis or other observable market prices. The Bank s policy is that fair values for these assets are based on current
appraisals or cash flow analysis. 

The following table presents fair value measurements for the
Company s financial instruments which are not recognized at fair value in the accompanying statements of financial position
on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. 

9.      INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

Investment securities available for sale
at September 30, 2016 consisted of the following: 

Investment securities held to maturity
at September 30, 2016 consisted of the following: 

Investment securities available for sale
at June 30, 2016 consisted of the following: 

Investment securities held to maturity
at June 30, 2016 consisted of the following: 

The mortgage-backed securities, callable bonds and municipal
bonds have the following maturities at September 30, 2016: 

All other securities available for sale at September 30, 2016
are saleable within one year. 

Gross proceeds on the sale of investment and mortgage-backed
securities were $18.0 million and $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross realized
gains for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $110,000 and $78,000 respectively. Gross realized losses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $31,000 and $72,000, respectively. 

The table below indicates the length of time individual investment
securities and mortgage-backed securities have been in a continuous loss position at September 30, 2016: 

Securities available for sale are reviewed for possible other-than-temporary
impairment on a quarterly basis. During this review, management considers the severity and duration of the unrealized losses as
well as its intent and ability to hold the securities until recovery, taking into account balance sheet management strategies
and its market view and outlook. Management also assesses the nature of the unrealized losses taking into consideration factors
such as changes in risk-free interest rates, general credit spread widening, market supply and demand, creditworthiness of the
issuer or any credit enhancement providers, and the quality of the underlying collateral. Management does not intend to sell these
securities in the foreseeable future, and does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell
a security in an unrealized loss position prior to a recovery in its value. The decline in market value is due to changes in market
interest rates. The fair values are expected to recover as the securities approach maturity dates. 

10.     GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET 

In June 2010, old United Community Bancorp acquired three branches
from Integra Bank National Association ( Integra ), which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Under the purchase method, the Company is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired, including
identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess
cost over the value of net assets acquired represents goodwill, which is not subject to amortization. 

Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the
value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Goodwill recorded by the Company in connection
with its acquisition relates to the inherent value in the business acquired and this value is dependent upon the Company s
ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in a competitive market place. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately
by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability
to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings
in future periods. 

As permitted by current accounting rules, the Company completed
its qualitative assessment to determine whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is
more likely than not, as defined, that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based upon the Company s
assessment, there was no such determination that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Accordingly,
the Company did not apply the traditional two-step goodwill impairment test. 

The following table indicates changes to the core deposit intangible
asset and goodwill balances for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

The core deposit intangible is being amortized using the double
declining balance method over its estimated useful life of 8.75 years. Remaining amortization of the core deposit intangible is
as follows (dollars in thousands) as of September 30, 2016: 

11.      DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (IN THOUSANDS) 

The following tables illustrate certain disclosures required

Allowance for Credit Losses and Recorded
Investment in Loans Receivable 

Federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets
on a regular basis. In addition, the OCC has the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be
classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss.  Substandard assets 
must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Doubtful assets  have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable,
and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified  loss  is considered uncollectible and of such little
value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a  special mention 
category, described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do
possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. If we classify an asset as substandard, doubtful
or loss, we analyze that asset and may establish a specific allocation for the asset at that time.

Impaired Loans  

Impaired Loans  

The Bank did not have any investments in subprime loans at
September 30, 2016. Impaired loans at September 30, 2016 included troubled debt restructurings ( TDR ) with an aggregate
principal balance of $3.3 million and a recorded investment of $3.3 million. See Note 12 for a discussion on TDRs. 

12 .       TROUBLED
DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS - From time to time, as part of our loss mitigation process, loans may be renegotiated in a TDR when we determine
that greater economic value will ultimately be recovered under the new restructured terms than through foreclosure, liquidation,
or bankruptcy. We may consider the borrower s payment status and history, the borrower s ability to pay upon a rate
reset on an adjustable rate loan, size of the payment increase upon a rate reset, period of time remaining prior to the rate reset,
and other relevant factors in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. TDRs are accounted for as set
forth in ASC 310-40  Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors  ( ASC 310-40 ). A TDR may be on nonaccrual or
it may accrue interest. A TDR is typically on nonaccrual until the borrower successfully performs under the new terms for at least
six consecutive months. However, a TDR may be placed on accrual immediately following the restructuring in those instances where
a borrower s payments are current prior to the modification, the loan is restructured at a market rate and management determines
that principal and interest under the new terms are fully collectible. All TDRs are considered to be impaired loans. A TDR will
be removed from TDR classification if it is restructured at a market rate, is not impaired under those restructured terms and
has been performing under those terms for at least twelve consecutive months.  

Existing performing loan customers who request a loan (non-TDR)
modification and who meet the Bank s underwriting standards may, usually for a fee, modify their original loan terms to
terms currently offered. The modified terms of these loans are similar to the terms offered to new customers with similar credit
risk. The fee assessed for modifying the loan is deferred and amortized over the life of the modified loan using the level-yield
method and is reflected as an adjustment to interest income. Each modification is examined on a loan-by-loan basis and if the
modification of terms represents more than a minor change to the loan, then the unamortized balance of the pre-modification deferred
fees or costs associated with the mortgage loan are recognized in interest income at the time of the modification. If the modification
of terms does not represent more than a minor change to the loan, then the unamortized balance of the pre-modification deferred
fees or costs continue to be deferred. 

The following tables summarize TDRs by loan type and accrual
status. 

Interest income recognized on TDRs is as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, the Bank had 22 loans totaling $3.3
million that were reported as TDRs, and had established an allowance for losses on these loans of $0. With respect to the $3.3
million in TDRs, the Bank charged-off $1.4 million at the time the loans were restructured into the Note A/B split note format.
At June 30, 2016, the Bank had 25 loans totaling $3.7 million that were reported as TDRs, and had an allowance for losses on these
loans of $0. With respect to the $3.7 million in TDRs, the Bank charged-off $1.4 million with respect to those loans at the time
the loans were restructured into the Note A/B split note format. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had no other commitments to lend
on its TDRs. Management continues to monitor the performance of loans reported as TDRs on a monthly basis. 

Loans that were included in TDRs at September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016 were generally given concessions of interest rate reductions of between 25 and 300 basis points and/or structured
as interest only payment loans for periods of one to three years. Some of these loans also have balloon payments due at the end
of their lowered rate period, requiring the borrower to refinance at market rates at that time. At September 30, 2016 and June
30, 2016, all loans classified as TDRs required principal and interest payments.

14.  EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit
Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the impairment model
for most financial assets. This ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses
on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The underlying premise of
the ASU is that financial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through
an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect
management s current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset. The
income statement will be effected for the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected
increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. With certain exceptions, transition to the new requirements will be through a cumulative effect adjustment
to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company
will be evaluating the impact of this ASU over the next several years. 

In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing, and affects the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which
is not yet effective. ASU No. 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: evaluating whether promised goods and
services are separately identifiable, and determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer
with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property, which is satisfied at a point in time, or a right to access
the entity s intellectual property, which is satisfied over time. ASU No. 2016-10 is effective for public companies for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Transitional
guidance is included in the update. Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-10 is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and affects all entities that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. The new guidance involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
of cash flows. Under ASU No. 2016-09, any excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense or
benefit in the income statement. Excess tax benefits are to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.
In accruing compensation cost, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards
that are expected to vest, as required under current guidance, or account for forfeitures when they occur. For an award to qualify
for equity classification, an entity cannot partially settle the award in excess of the employer's maximum statutory withholding
requirements. Such cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified
as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 are effective for public business entities
for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
Adoption of ASU No. 2016-07 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), and affects
the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which is not yet effective. When
another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to determine whether
the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange
for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). The amendments in ASU No. 2016-08
are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 on principal versus
agent considerations by offering additional guidance to be considered in making the determination. ASU No. 2016-08 is effective
for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
period. Transitional guidance is included in the update. Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating
the financial statement impact of adopting the new guidance. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic
842), and requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments ( the
lease liability ) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, initially
measured at the present value of the lease payments. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, the lessee should
include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain, as defined, to exercise an option to
the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. Optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included
if the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise the purchase option. Most variable lease payments should be excluded except
for those that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments. A lessee shall classify a lease as a finance lease
if it meets any of five listed criteria: 1) The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of
the lease term. 2) The lease grants the lessee and option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain
to exercise. 3) The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. 4) The present value
of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair
value of the underlying asset. 5) The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative
use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. For finance leases, a lessee shall recognize in the statement of comprehensive
income interest on the lease liability separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. Amortization of the right-of-use
asset shall be on a straight-line basis, unless another basis is more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects
to consume the right-of-use asset s future economic benefits. If the lease does not meet any of the five criteria, the lessee
shall classify it as an operating lease and shall recognize a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying
asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense
for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this update are to be applied using
a modified retrospective approach, as defined, and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the financial statement impact of adopting the new guidance. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial
Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10). The amendments in this update affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial
liabilities. The update s main provisions applicable to the Company are as follows: 1) Require equity investments with readily
available fair values (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation
of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) Simplify the impairment
assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment;
3) Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate
the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; 4)
Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
purposes; 5) Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and 6) Clarify that an entity should evaluate
the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s
other deferred tax assets. Public companies should apply the guidance in Update 2016-01 to annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is generally not permitted.
An entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the
annual reporting period of adoption. We do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a significant impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward-Looking Statements  

This report contains forward-looking statements
that are based on assumptions and may describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company. These forward-looking
statements are generally identified by use of the words  believe,   expect,   intend,   anticipate, 
 estimate,   project  or similar expressions. The Company s ability to predict results or the actual
effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations
of the Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, changes in the interest rate
environment, legislative or regulatory changes that may adversely affect our business, changes in accounting policies and practices,
changes in competition and demand for financial services, adverse changes in the securities markets, changes in deposit flows,
and changes in the quality or composition of the Company s loan or investment portfolios. Additionally, other risks and
uncertainties may be described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on September 27, 2016, which is available through the SEC s website at  www.sec.gov  and in other reports filed by
the Company. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should
not be placed on such statements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company does not undertake the responsibility,
and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We consider accounting policies involving
significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain
assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies: the
allowance for loan losses and the valuation of deferred income taxes. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES - The allowance
for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the
statement of financial condition date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to
income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material
estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on affected
loans; and the value of collateral. Inherent loss factors based upon environmental and other economic factors are then applied
to the remaining loan portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of
the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past
loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we
believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance
may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition,
the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. Such agency may require
us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination.
A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect
earnings. For additional discussion, see Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2016. 

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES - We use the asset
and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 740-10-50.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current
available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing
of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income.
The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a
continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to
record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense
in the period, which would negatively affect earnings. United Community Bancorp referred to as the Company, accounts for income
taxes under the provisions of ASC 275-10-50-8 to account for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized tax
benefits as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The Company recognized no interest and penalties on the underpayment of income
taxes during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and had no accrued interest and penalties on the balance
sheet as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The Company has no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the
total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase within the next fiscal year. The Company is no longer subject
to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years ended on or before June 30, 2012. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016   

Balance Sheet Analysis   

Total assets were $528.1 million at September
30, 2016, compared to $526.1 million at June 30, 2016. Total loans increased by $6.0 million. The increase in loans was partially
offset by a $4.3 million decrease in investment securities. The investment balances decreased partially due to normal amortization
and maturities during the period and the sale of investment securities. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of investments
securities was used to fund new loans, which is expected to enhance the Bank s net interest margin as well as increase interest
income in the future. 

Total liabilities increased $1.8 million
from $455.6 million at June 30, 2016 to $457.4 million at September 30, 2016 primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in deposits
during the quarter, partially offset by the settlement of investments which was included in other liabilities at June 30, 2016. 

Stockholders  equity totaled $70.7
million as of September 30, 2016, which represents an increase of $221,000 when compared to June 30, 2016. Net income of $782,000
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by a reduction in the unrealized gain on securities available for
sale of $490,000 and dividends paid totaling $252,000. The $782,000 net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 represented
an increase of $83,000, or 11.9% when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. There were 4,198,143 outstanding shares
of common stock at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. For all periods presented, the Bank was considered  well-capitalized 
under applicable regulatory requirements. 

Loans.   At September 30,
2016, one- to four- family residential loans totaled $143.6 million, or 51.3% of total gross loans, compared to $143.0 million,
or 52.2% of total gross loans, at June 30, 2016. 

Multi-family and nonresidential real estate
loans totaled $79.5 million and represented 28.4% of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to $75.0 million, or 27.3% of
total loans, at June 30, 2016. While repayments and charge-offs have recently reduced these portfolios, they remain a substantial
segment of our loan portfolio. However, we have reviewed the economic environment in our lending markets, including those in southwestern
Ohio and Northern Kentucky, and the level of our nonperforming assets, and beginning in December 2013, we implemented a controlled
growth strategy to prudently increase nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios. Starting in 2014,
we hired experienced commercial lenders and credit staff to enhance our capacity to implement this strategy of prudently growing
the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. 

Construction loans totaled $9.0 million,
or 3.2% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $8.6 million, or 3.1% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. 

Commercial business loans totaled $4.9
million, or 1.8% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $4.5 million, or 1.6% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. 

Consumer loans totaled $35.6 million and
represented 12.7% of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to $35.0 million or 12.8% of total loans at June 30, 2016. 

Agricultural loans totaled $4.8 million,
or 1.7% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $6.0 million or 2.2% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. 

Land loans totaled $2.4 million, or 0.9%
of total loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.2 million or 0.8% of total loans at June 30, 2016. 

The following table sets forth the composition
of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated. 

Loan Maturity  

The following table sets forth certain
information at September 30, 2016 regarding the dollar amount of loan principal repayments becoming due during the periods indicated.
The table does not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of the loan and may cause
our actual repayment experience to differ from the contractual requirements shown below. Demand loans having no stated schedule
of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. 

The following table sets forth the dollar
amount of all loans at September 30, 2016 due after September 30, 2017 that have either fixed interest rates or adjustable interest
rates. The amounts shown below exclude unearned interest on consumer loans and deferred loan fees. 

Loan Activity  

The following table shows loan origination,
repayment and sale activity during the periods indicated. 

(1)  Includes loan renewals, loan refinancings and restructured loans.   

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015   

Overview.   Net income increased
$83,000 to $782,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $699,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest Income.   The
following table summarizes changes in interest income and interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net interest income totaled $3.3 million
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This represented a decrease of $39,000, or 1.2% when compared to the quarter ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was caused by a decrease in interest income of $15,000 as well as an increase in interest expense of $24,000.
Interest income decreased as a result of a $62,000 decrease in interest income on investments. The decrease in interest income
on investments was partially offset by a $47,000 increase in interest income on loans. Interest income on investments decreased
due to a decrease in the average balance of approximately $12.8 million as well as a decrease in the average yield on investments
from 2.10% to 2.06%. Interest income on loans increased due to an increase in the average balance of approximately $11.7 million.
This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate earned on loans from 4.47% to 4.34%. The increase in loan
balances was the result of an increase in mortgage loan balances and the controlled growth strategy in commercial lending. The
$24,000 increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in new deposit accounts resulting from a successful seasonal
checking account promotion. In addition, the average balance of deposits increased $11.9 million. 

The following table summarizes average
balances and average yields and costs of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. For the purposes of this table, average balances have been calculated using month-end balances, and nonaccrual
loans are included in average balances only. Yields are not presented on a tax equivalent basis. 

Provision for Loan Losses.  
The provision for loan losses was $17,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $44,000 for the quarter ended September
30, 2015. 

Nonperforming assets to total assets increased
to 0.59% from 0.56% at June 30, 2016, an increase of 5.4%. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased from 1.05%
at June 30, 2016 to 1.09% at September 30, 2016, and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total assets increased from 0.55%
at June 30, 2016 to 0.58% at September 30, 2016. 

Noninterest Income.   The
following table summarizes noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Noninterest income totaled $1.3 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, which represented an increase of $241,000, or 22.6% when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $130,000 in gain on the sale of mortgage loans, a $73,000 increase in gain on
the sale of investments, and a $46,000 increase in service charge income on deposit accounts. Service charge income increased
primarily due to increased activity in deposit accounts and debit card usage. These increases were partially offset by a $66,000
decrease in income from bank owned life insurance. Death benefits totaling $68,000 were received in the prior year quarter with
no such amounts received in the current year quarter. 

Noninterest Expense.   The
following table shows the components of noninterest expense and the percentage changes for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. 

Noninterest expense totaled $3.7 million
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which represented an increase of $37,000, or 1.0% when compared to the quarter ended
September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in data processing expense of $159,000. $111,000 of the increase
in data processing expense was primarily due to an increase in users taking advantage of new mobile banking products, increases
in debit card usage, and increases in data center service charges. $30,000 of the increase related to the expiration of a monthly
implementation credit. The $159,000 increase in data processing expense was partially offset by a $117,000 decrease in other operating
expenses, including an $89,000 decrease in loan closing costs incurred and a $26,000 decrease in expenses related to other real
estate owned. The decrease in loan closing costs incurred was primarily due to a change in the Company s accounting method
for certain loan closing costs associated with a closing cost promotion. Prior to July 1, 2016, the Company charged certain loan
closing costs immediately to expense. Pursuant to ASC 310-20, the Company is deferring a portion of these closing costs associated
with new loans and amortizing those costs over the life of the loan. The decrease in other real estate owned related expenses
was due to property improvement expenses in the prior year period with no corresponding expenses in the current year period. 

Income Taxes.     Income
tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $165,000 compared to $56,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The effective tax rate increased to 17.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 7.6% for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets.
  We consider foreclosed real estate, repossessed assets and nonaccrual loans, including nonaccrual TDR loans, to be nonperforming
assets. 

All of the TDRs at September 30, 2016
represented loan relationships with long-time borrowers. In measuring impairment, management considered the results of independent
property appraisals, together with estimated selling expenses, and/or detailed cash flow analyses. At September 30, 2016, 22 loans
were considered to be TDRs (with a recorded investment of $3.3 million) of which seven loans (with a recorded investment of $1.0
million) were included in nonperforming assets. 

The following table provides information
with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. 

Interest income that would have been recorded
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms was $79,000.
Interest recognized on the cash basis with regard to nonaccrual restructured loans was $0 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

Nonperforming assets as a percentage of
total assets decreased from 1.21% at September 30, 2015 to 0.59% at September 30, 2016. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of
total assets increased slightly from 0.56% at June 30, 2016 to 0.59% at September 30, 2016. Beginning with the disclosure in the
Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the Company included  Loan Relationship  narratives
regarding its five largest nonaccrual (nonperforming) loans and loans having the five largest charge-offs, all of which were commercial
real estate loans. As of March 31, 2011, the amount of nonaccrual (nonperforming) loans totaled $19.5 million, and the amount
of accruing TDR loans totaled $7.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, the amount of nonaccrual (nonperforming) loans decreased
to $3.1 million and the amount of accruing TDR loans decreased to 2.3 million. 

Because of the decrease in nonaccrual (nonperforming)
loans and accruing TDR loans over the last five years, the Loan Relationship narratives since December 31, 2015 have focused on
commercial Loan Relationships with the following loans: 

The largest
                                         nonaccruing commercial real estate loans (including nonaccrual TDRs) having a carrying
                                         value of at least $250,000, plus any related commercial or retail loans;   

The largest
                                         commercial real estate loan charge-offs having a charge-off of at least $250,000 that
                                         are related to commercial real estate loans in a Loan Relationship, whether accruing
                                         or not, plus any related commercial or retail loans; and   

The largest
                                         accruing TDR commercial loans having a carrying value of at least $250,000 plus any related
                                         commercial or retail loans.   

If a commercial loan falls into one of the three
categories listed above, then a narrative is composed for 

 that commercial loan and any related commercial or retail loans. 

At September 30, 2016: 

The largest
                                         commercial real estate nonaccrual loans having a carrying value of at least $250,000
                                         are related to loans in Loan Relationships M   Q. There are a total of three loans
                                         in these two Loan Relationships.   

The largest
                                         commercial real estate loan charge-offs of at least $250,000 are related to loans in
                                         Loan Relationships F, H, M, O, and Q. There are a total of 11 loans in these five Loan
                                         Relationships.   

The largest
                                         accruing TDRs having a carrying value of at least $250,000 are related to a loan in Loan
                                         Relationship O. There are a total of three loans in this Loan Relationship.   

As discussed below, some of the Loan Relationships
include loans that were restructured using the  Note A/B split note  strategy for which the amount of the Note B loan
has been charged-off, with the borrower remaining responsible for that charged-off amount unless otherwise agreed to by the Bank.
For purposes of the narratives, loans that have a carrying value are identified by a Loan number within each Loan Relationship,
such as  Loan A-1  and  Loan A-2 . However, the Note B loans are identified as a  Note B loan 
because these loans have no carrying value because they have been charged-off. 

Management monitors the performance of
all of these loans and reviews all options available to keep the loans current, including further restructuring of the loans.
If restructuring efforts ultimately are not successful, management will initiate foreclosure proceedings.  

Loan Relationship F . At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan Relationship
    F was comprised of two loans, a Note A loan (Loan F-1) and a Note B loan, having an aggregate carrying value of $411,000 and
    $414,000, respectively. These loans are secured by a multi-family residential real estate property and a single-family real
    estate property. The borrower is a corporate entity, with three principals, each of whom is a co-borrower of the loan.  In
    the  Credit Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade  table, Loan F-1 is classified as  Multi-family real
    estate, Watch  at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  As of June 30, 2014, Loan F-1was no longer reported
    as a TDR, or classified as substandard, because the loan was current and there were more than 12 consecutive monthly payments
    made on time. Additionally, recent appraisals obtained for the properties securing the loan indicated that the loan to value
    ratio of the loan complied with the Bank s underwriting standards, and the cash flow analysis performed on the loan
    from updated financial information indicated that the debt service coverage ratio complied with the Bank s underwriting
    standards. Loan F-1 was performing in accordance with its terms at September 30, 2016. A more detailed history of Loan Relationship
    F follows.  

The original loan was initially restructured using
the Note A/B split note strategy in June 2010 based on an 80% loan-to-value ratio derived from an April 2010 independent appraisal.
The first loan (Note A loan) had a balance of $631,000 with a market interest rate of 5.50%, for a 25-year term, based on a 3/1
ARM. This loan was put on nonaccrual and classified as substandard. The second loan (a Note B loan) had a balance of $216,800
and there was a specific reserve established for the entire amount of the loan. The borrower was a corporate entity, with two
principals, each of whom individually was a co-borrower of the loans. At December 31, 2010, the first loan was 160 days delinquent.
The delinquency was a result of personal problems between the borrowers affecting their ability to manage the multi-family residential
real estate and the single-family real estate. The personal problems between the borrowers also resulted in the borrowers 
inability to make the required personal cash infusions. In the latter part of 2010 and into early 2011, one of the borrowers effectively
took control of the multi-family residential real estate and the single-family real estate, and brought the business current with
respect to property taxes, deposit refunds to former tenants, and made required monthly loan payments in January and February
2011. Other than the January and February 2011 loan payments, the borrowers were unable to make payments to bring the loan current.
Based upon those developments, management completed a detailed analysis of the total lending relationship with the borrowers.
As a result of this analysis, these loans were again restructured, using the Note A/B split note strategy in March 2011. The terms
of the first loan (a Note A loan) were calculated using the borrowers  then current financial information to yield a payment
having a debt service coverage ratio of approximately 1.5x, which was more stringent than the Bank s normal underwriting
standards. A restructuring fee of $7,000 was charged and included in the second loan (a Note B loan) at March 31, 2011. After
the restructuring in March 2011, the Note A loan had a balance of $475,000, was put on nonaccrual, classified as substandard and
reported as a TDR. The Note B loan had a balance of $405,000. The full amount of the Note B loan was charged-off in the quarter
ended March 31, 2011, inclusive of the previous specific reserve of $216,800 from December 31, 2010. 

A two-year balloon payment was due in March 31,
2013 on the loans unless the borrower refinanced the loans to a market rate loan at that time. During the quarter ended December
31, 2012, as a result of the continued personal problems of the co-borrowers, the two loans were modified with one of the borrowers
who had taken control of the two properties in early 2011. The other borrower relinquished all of its interest in the two properties.
However, in addition to the one borrower retained on the loan, two other borrowers were added to the loans to provide managerial
strength to the relationship and increase the property s income potential. The Bank had been reviewing the cash flow of
the property on a monthly basis and determined that the cash flows had improved due to the borrowers  enhanced managerial
ability. An independent appraisal was ordered to provide the  as is  value of the properties. The Bank obtained the
appraisal in December 2012, and the appraised value of the properties had decreased to $730,000 from $774,000 in February 2011.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, the two loans were modified, again using the Note A/B split note strategy, with both
loans having three year balloon payments. The Note A loan was modified to a market interest rate of 5.50%, with no increase in
the principal balance ($453,000). The term of the loan was also reduced to 324 months from the remaining term of 339 months. Even
with the higher market interest rate and the shorter term of the loan, the debt service coverage ratio was above 1.20x, which
complied with the Bank s current loan underwriting standards. This loan remained on accrual (because of its sufficient payment
history since the September 30, 2011 quarter), classified as substandard, and reported as a TDR. There was no increase in the
principal balance ($405,000) of the Note B loan from that loan s prior restructuring in March 2011, and therefore, the charge-off
amount ($405,000) remained the same as in March 2011. However, the interest rate was reduced to 0% as the loan had been charged-off. 

During the December 2015 quarter, the balloon payment
from the December 2012 renewal became due. Due to the upcoming balloon payment, the Bank ordered new appraisals on the two properties.
The Bank received the appraisals in October 2015, and the appraised value of the properties increased to $773,000 from $730,000
in December 2012. The Bank also reviewed the cash flow from updated financials of the borrowers and co-borrowers. After this review
and based on the increase in value of the properties, the Bank extended the two loans, again using the Note A/B split note strategy,
with both loans having three year balloon payments. The Note A Loan was renewed at the market interest rate of 5.50%, with no
increase in the principal balance ($421,000). The term of the loan was renewed at 288 months, the remaining term of the loan.
This loan remained on accrual (because of its sufficient payment history) and classified as watch. There was no increase in the
principal balance ($405,000) of the Note B loan from that loan s prior restructuring in December 2012, and therefore, the
charge-off amount ($405,000) remained the same as in December 2012. The interest rate remained at 0% as the loan had been charged-off. 

Loan Relationship H.  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan Relationship
    H was comprised of three loans having an aggregate carrying value of $891,000 and $901,000, respectively.  At September
    30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, two of the loans, a Note A loan (Loan H-1) and a Note B loan, had an aggregate carrying value
    of $692,000 and $696,000, respectively. Loan H-1 is secured by a first lien on an 18-unit apartment complex, a single-family
    rental dwelling, a 6.3 acre tract of land, and a second lien on a single-family owner occupied dwelling on 11.36 acres. The
    borrower is a limited liability company and the two co-borrowers are the principals of the limited liability company. At September
    30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan H-1 was classified as  Multi-family residential real estate, Watch  in the  Credit
    Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade  table. As of June 30, 2014, Loan H-1 was no longer reported as a TDR loan
    because the loan was current and there were more than 12 consecutive market rate monthly payments made on time. Also, recent
    appraisals indicated that the loan to value was adequate and the cash flows from updated financial information of the properties
    securing the loan indicated that the debt service coverage ratio was adequate.  

During the quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Bank refinanced
        the principal residence of the co-borrowers (the single-family owner occupied dwelling on 11.36 acres mentioned above).
        This loan, Loan H-2, had an original balance of $280,000 at a market rate of interest for a ten year term. At September
        30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the balance of Loan H-2 was $199,000 and $206,000, respectively. Loan H-2 is secured by a
        first lien on the single-family owner occupied dwelling on 11.36 acres mentioned above. The borrowers are a husband and
        wife who are the principals in the limited liability company mentioned above. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
        Loan H-2 was classified as  One- to Four-Family Owner-Occupied Mortgage, Watch  in the  Credit Risk
        Profile by Internally Assigned Grade  table. 
           
         At September 30, 2016, Loan H-1 and Loan H-2 were performing
        in accordance with their terms. A more detailed history of the Note A loan (Loan H-1) and the Note B loan follows.   

During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the
Note A loan (Loan H-1) and the Note B loan were comprised of one loan with a carrying value of $1.3 million and classified as
special mention. In the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the co-borrowers approached the Bank and advised that the only co-borrower
who was employed had experienced a substantial salary reduction. The borrowers requested an interest rate reduction to 3% and
interest only payments for three years. Independent appraisals were ordered and received and reflected that the properties on
which the Bank had a first lien position had an aggregate value of $1.0 million. The loan was classified as substandard, placed
on nonaccrual, and reported as a TDR. Due to the reduced interest rate, a specific valuation of $123,000 was established for the
loan through a charge-off to the general allowance. Under the loan s modified terms, the interest rate was to reset to 5.75%
on June 1, 2012. In June 2012, the co-borrowers approached the Bank and advised that the properties  cash flow could not
service the increase in interest rate. Independent appraisals were ordered and received in June 2012 and reflected that the properties
on which the Bank had a first lien position had decreased to $978,000 from $1.0 million in June 2009. As a result, the Bank recorded
a charge-off of $481,000, (inclusive of the $123,000 specific allocation established) to reflect the carrying value of the loan
at $744,000. The one loan performed in accordance with its restructured terms until the September 30, 2012 quarter, when the co-borrowers
again approached the Bank and advised that the properties  cash flow could not service the loan. Therefore, the one loan
was restructured using the Note A/B split note strategy. The Note A loan (Loan H-1) was for $748,000, with a market rate of interest
of 5.00%, for a 30-year term and a three year balloon payment. The carrying value of this loan was placed on nonaccrual, classified
as substandard, and reported as a TDR. The Note B loan was for $515,000 (inclusive of the $481,000 that was charged-off in the
June 30, 2012 quarter) and was charged-off. The interest rate was reduced to 0% as the loan had been charged-off. 

During the September 2015 quarter, the balloon payment
from the September 2012 renewal became due. As a result of the upcoming balloon payment, the Bank ordered new appraisals on the
18-unit apartment complex and the single-family rental dwelling. The Bank received new appraisals on the 18 unit apartment complex
and the single-family rental dwelling in September 2015. In addition, the Bank used the June 2014 value of the 6.3 acre tract
of land. The total appraised value of the three properties increased to $1,048,000 as compared to the $978,000 total appraised
value in June 2012. The Bank also reviewed the cash flow from updated financials of the borrower and co-borrowers. After this
review and based on the increase in value of the properties, the Bank extended the two loans, again using the Note A/B split note
strategy, with both loans having three year balloon payments. The Note A loan (Loan H-1) was renewed at the market interest rate
of 5.00%, using a 1/1 ARM, with a 5% floor rate, and with no increase in the principal balance ($710,000). The term of the loan
was renewed at 324 months. This loan was put on accrual (because of its sufficient payment history) and classified as watch. There
was no increase in the principal balance ($515,000) of the Note B loan from that loan s prior restructuring in September
2012, and therefore, the charge-off amount ($515,000) remained the same as in September 2012. The interest rate remained at 0%
as the loan had been charged-off. 

Loan Relationship M . At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan Relationship
    M was comprised of two loans having an aggregate carrying value of $647,000 and $1.1 million, respectively. At September 30,
    2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan M-1 had an aggregate carrying value of $194,000 and $571,000, respectively.  At September
    30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan M-2 had an aggregate carrying value of $453,000 and $495,000, respectively.  Originally
    Loans M-1 and M-2 were both secured by the two golf courses, including a club house on each, in the greater Cincinnati area,
    an approximately 25 acre tract of land, and a second mortgage on the principal residence of two of the individual co-borrowers.
    The borrower of Loans M-1 and M-2 is a corporate entity, each of whose principals, a husband and wife, has individually signed
    as a co-borrower, as have the father and stepmother of one of the co-borrowers. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loans
    M-1 and M-2 are included in the table in  Nonaccrual, Nonresidential Real Estate  and classified as  Nonresidential
    Real Estate, Substandard  in the  Credit Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade  table. During the June
    30, 2015 quarter, the Bank entered into a forbearance agreement with the borrower and co-borrowers pursuant to which full
    principal, interest and escrow payments will be made for the months of May through October of each year beginning in 2015.
    The maturity date for these loans is now October 1, 2018.  Loans M-1 and M-2 were performing in accordance with
    their restructured terms at September 30, 2016.  A more detailed history of Loan Relationship M follows.  

Loan M-1 originated in December 2007 and Loan M-2
originated in July 2009, each with a 20 year term. Under each loan s terms, payments were due from April through December
of each year; no payments were required in January, February and March of each year. Due to reduced cash flows resulting from
inclement weather, in December 2013 the co-borrowers advised the Bank that they would pay the amounts due for November and December
2013 in February and March 2014, respectively. Due to the continuation of the severe winter weather and resultant reduced cash
flows, the borrowers were unable to make the November and December 2013 payments that the borrowers had stated would be paid in
February and March 2014, and were unable to make the real estate tax payment due during the period ended March 31, 2014. As a
result of the failure to make the November and December 2013 payments and the borrowers  failure to pay real estate taxes,
the Bank had both properties appraised. The appraisals were received in March 2014 and reflected an aggregate decrease in value
of approximately $500,000 as compared to their March 2009 appraised value. Based on the new appraised value, there was no known
loss to the Bank. The Bank also performed an impairment analysis on each loan in March 2014 resulting in an aggregate impairment
of $41,000. In March 2014, the Bank and the co-borrowers agreed to a revised repayment plan to bring all payments then due, and
real estate taxes due, but not paid during the period ended March 31, 2014, current by July 31, 2014. At June 30, 2014, an impairment
analysis was performed. The impairment analysis showed that no further impairment was needed on either Loan M-1 or Loan M-2.  

At September 30, 2014, the borrowers had successfully
complied with the revised payment plan agreement from March 31, 2014 and both loans were current. Additionally, the real estate
taxes due during the March 31, 2014 quarter were paid. However, at September 30, 2014, the real estate taxes that were due in
July 2014 had not been paid. At December 31, 2014, due to cash flow issues caused by inclement weather during the quarter, the
real estate taxes that were due in July 2014 were still not paid, and the loan payments due for October, November, and December
2014 were not paid. The Bank met with the husband and wife co-borrowers during the December 31, 2014 quarter. The co-borrowers
advised the Bank that they would not be able to make the past due payments and the past due real estate taxes because of the inclement
weather during the quarter until the golf season opened in the spring of 2015. Because of these developments, the Bank performed
another impairment analysis of these two loans. While the appraisals of the properties showed no need for an impairment, the Bank
further analyzed the cash flow of the golf courses. After this analysis, the Bank determined that an additional impairment of
$466,000 was needed for this loan relationship, and an additional charge-off of $233,000 was established for each of the two loans
in this loan relationship, through a charge-off to the general allowance. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Bank entered
into further discussions with the co-borrowers about another revised payment plan. As stated above, during the June 30, 2015 quarter,
the Bank entered into a forbearance agreement with the borrower and co-borrowers. An impairment analysis was performed for the
quarter ended June 30, 2015. The impairment analysis showed that no further impairment was needed on either Loan M-1 or M-2. For
the quarter ended December 31, 2015, because there was still the partial escrow payment due for the October 2015 escrow payment,
the Bank performed another impairment analysis. Even though the partial escrow payment was paid subsequent to the December 31,
2015 quarter and the appraisals of the properties indicated no further impairment was needed, the Bank reviewed the observable
market price of the properties and determined that an additional impairment of $250,000 was needed for this loan relationship,
and an additional charge-off of $125,000 was established for each of the two loans in this loan relationship through a charge-off
to the general allowance. 

During the March 31, 2016 quarter, because there
had not been an updated appraisal since the March 2014 quarter, the Bank ordered and received new appraisals on all of the collateral
securing this Loan Relationship. The new appraisal on one of the golf courses decreased to $1.1 million from $1.2 million. The
new appraisal on the other golf course decreased to $1.4 million from $1.6 million. The new appraisal on the approximately 25
acre tract of land increased to $100,000 from $95,000. The new appraisal for the principal residence of two of the individual
co-borrowers increased to $165,000 from $150,000. Also during the March 2016 quarter, the husband and wife principals of the two
corporate entities informed the Bank that they were not going to open the golf course that appraised for $1.1 million for the
2016 golf season and that they are going to attempt to sell the property as a land development project. Subsequent to the end
of the March 2016 quarter, the Bank was informed that one of the co-borrowers had passed. She was the wife of one of the co-borrowers
and the stepmother of one of the other co-borrowers who is one of the two principals of the corporate entities.     

During the June 30, 2016 quarter, the borrowers
entered into a purchase agreement to sell the golf course that was not opened. As part of this purchase, the Bank agreed to release
the nonoperational golf course, the 25 acre tract of land, and the co-borrower who was the father of one of the principals. The
Bank would have the first mortgage, instead of a second mortgage, on the principal residence of two of the individual co-borrowers.
However, based on this purchase agreement, the Bank determined that an additional impairment of $210,000 was needed for this loan
relationship, and an additional charge-off of $105,000 was established for each of the two loans in the loan relationship through
a charge-off to the general allowance. The nonoperational golf course was sold subsequent to the end of the June 30, 2016 quarter.
After the sale and subsequent reduction of the principal balance of Loan M-1, the Bank determined that no further impairment was
needed. Also, subsequent to the June 30, 2016 quarter, the Bank entered into an amended forbearance agreement with the borrower
and co-borrowers, reflecting the reduced principal balances for Loans M-1 and M-2. The maturity date for these loans remained
at October 1, 2018. The Bank will monitor the cash flow of the remaining golf course and determine if any further impairment is
necessary. 

Loan Relationship
                                         O . At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, this Loan Relationship consisted of three
                                         loans having an aggregate carrying value of $1.6 million. At September 30, 2016 and June
                                         30, 2016, two of the loans, a Note A loan (Loan O-1) and a Note B loan, had an aggregate
                                         carrying value of $718,000 and $721,000, respectively. Loan O-1 is secured by a first
                                         lien on a nonresidential retail strip center. The borrower is a limited liability company
                                         and the two co-borrowers are the principals of the limited liability company. At September
                                         30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan O-1 is included in the table as  Accruing Restructured
                                         Loans , and classified as  Nonresidential Real Estate, Substandard 
                                         in the  Credit Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade  table. As of September
                                         30, 2011, Loan O-1 was put on accrual because of its sufficient payment history, but
                                         was still considered a TDR and thus continued to be classified as substandard. At September
                                         30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the balance of Loan O-2 was $875,000 and $890,000, respectively.
                                         Loan O-2 is secured by a nonresidential, eight bay, retail strip center. Loan O-2 is
                                         not included in the table as  Accruing Restructured Loans  at September 30,
                                         2016 and June 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan O-2 was classified
                                         as  Nonresidential Real Estate, Watch  in the  Credit Risk Profile
                                         by Internally Assigned Grade  table. This loan was originated in December 2004,
                                         for the purchase of the land (which was an Other Real Estate Owned property of the Bank)
                                         and the construction of the eight bay, retail strip center. The original loan amount
                                         was $1,080,000 at a market rate of interest, based on a 3/3 ARM, for a 30 year term.
                                         In August 2013, the original loan was refinanced for $965,000, at a market rate of interest,
                                         based on a 5/1 ARM, for a 22 year term. The borrower, for the original loan and the refinanced
                                         loan, is a limited liability company and the four co-borrowers are the principals of
                                         the limited liability company. Three of the spouses of the four co-borrowers are also
                                         signed on the loan. Two of the co-borrowers of the loan O-2 are principals of the limited
                                         liability company for Loan O-1 described above. At September 30, 2016, Loan O-2 has performed
                                         in accordance with its originated and refinanced terms. A more detailed history of the
                                         Note A loan (Loan O-1) and the Note B loan follows.   

In June 2006, Loan O-1 was originated and comprised
of one loan for $1.1 million. In the June 2010 quarter, the co-borrowers approached the Bank and advised that the anchor tenant
was vacating the retail strip center. Independent appraisals were ordered and received, and reflected the value of the property
had decreased to a value of $900,000 from the value of $1.4 million in June 2006. A specific valuation allowance was established
for $360,000 to reduce the net carrying value down to $720,000, or 80% loan to value. In the March 2011 quarter, the co-borrowers
again approached the Bank and advised that even though they had been able to replace the anchor tenant, the lease amount that
they were receiving was 20% less than the previous tenant. A new appraisal was ordered and received in the March 2011 quarter,
and reflected the value of the property had decreased to a value of $828,000 from the value of $900,000 in June 2010. The Bank
reviewed the present value of future cash flow of this property and the one loan was restructured using the Note A/B split note
strategy. Based on the present value of future cash flow of the property, the Note A loan (Loan O-1) was for $810,000, with a
below market rate of interest of 2%, for a 30 year term, and a two year balloon payment. The carrying value of the Loan O-1 continued
on nonaccrual and a classification of substandard, but was also reported as a TDR. The Note B loan was for $360,000 (inclusive
of the $360,000 specific valuation allowance established in June 2010) and was charged-off. In September 2011, because there were
six consecutive payments made and the cash flow of the property from updated financial information indicated that the debt service
coverage ratio was adequate, the loan was placed on accrual. However, because of the below market interest rate, an impairment
of $28,750 was established. During the March 2013 quarter, the balloon payment from the March 2011 loan became due. As a result
of the upcoming balloon payment, the Bank ordered and received a new appraisal on the property. The new appraisal dated March
2013 showed a value of $825,000, a decrease of $3,000 from the value of $828,000 in the March 2011 quarter. The Bank reviewed
the present value of the future cash flow of this property from updated financial information of the borrower and co-borrowers.
After this review, the Bank extended the two loans, again using the Note A/B split note strategy, with both loans having three
year balloon payments. The loan amount for the Note A loan (Loan O-1) was decreased to $761,000. The Note A loan (Loan O-1) was
renewed at a market rate of interest of 5.5%, for a 30 year term, and a three year balloon payment. This loan was placed on accrual
(because of its sufficient payment history). However, the classification remained substandard and the loan was still reported
as a TDR. Also, because this loan now had a market rate of interest, the impairment amount of $28,750 was removed. The Note B
loan was for $376,000 (inclusive of the $366,000 charge-off from March 2011) and was charged-off. During the March 31, 2016 quarter,
the balloon payment from the March 2013 loan became due. As a result of the upcoming balloon payment, the Bank ordered and received
a new appraisal on the property. The new appraisal dated February 2016 showed a value of $870,000, an increase of $45,000 from
the value of $825,000 in the March 2013 quarter. The Bank reviewed the present value of the future cash flow of this property
from updated financial information of the borrower and co-borrowers. After this review, the Bank extended the two loans, again
using the Note A/B split note strategy, with both loans having a one year balloon payment. The loan amount for the Note A loan
(Loan O-1) was decreased to $723,000. The Note A loan (Loan O-1) was renewed at a market rate of interest of 5.5%, for a 27 year
term, and a one year balloon payment. This loan was placed on accrual because of its sufficient payment history. However, the
classification remained substandard and the loan was still reported as TDR. There was no increase in the principal balance ($376,000)
of the Note B loan from that loan s prior restructuring in March 2013, and therefore, the charge-off amount ($376,000) remained
the same as in March 2013. The interest rate remained at 0%, as the loan had been charged-off. At September 30, 2016, Loan O-1
was performing in accordance with its restructured terms. 

Loan Relationship
                                         Q . At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Loan Relationship  
                                          was comprised of one loan, having a carrying value of $723,000 and $1.2 million,
                                         respectively. This loan is secured by two mobile home parks located in southeastern Indiana.
                                         The borrowers are two limited liability corporate entities, with four principals (one
                                         of whom has passed) of each entity, with each principal signing individually as a co-borrower.
                                         At September 30, 2016, the Loan Q carrying value is included in the table for  Nonaccrual,
                                         Nonresidential Real Estate , and at June 30, 2016, the carrying value of Loan Q
                                         was not included in the table for  Nonaccrual, Nonresidential Real Estate .
                                         In the  Credit Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade  table, Loan Q is
                                         classified as substandard at September 30, 2016 and as special mention at June 30, 2016.   

Loan Q is performing in accordance with its original
terms at September 30, 2016. A more detailed history of Loan Relationship Q follows. 

Loan Q originated in July 2004 and the loan has
always performed in accordance with its original terms. However, during the September 2016 quarter, the Bank received updated
financial information and performed an impairment analysis based on the cash flow of the two mobile home parks. Based on this
analysis, it was determined that the two mobile home parks could not support the $1.15 million loan balance. Based on the impairment
analysis, the Bank established an impairment in the amount of $425,000 through a charge-off to the general allowance. The Bank
also ordered appraisals on the two properties, but the appraisals have not yet been received. The co-borrowers are trying to refinance
these properties with another financial institution. 

The following table summarizes
all Note A/B format loans at September 30, 2016: 

(1)  Included in this total are an aggregate of $1.8 million
of Note A loans and an aggregate of $1.3 million of Note B loans that are included in the discussion of Loan Relationships F,
H and O. 

The following table provides information
with respect to all of our loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. For additional information regarding troubled
debt restructurings on nonaccrual status, see the table of nonperforming assets above. 

The following table is a roll forward
of activity in our TDRs: 

Loans that were included in TDRs at September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were generally given concessions of interest rate reductions of between 25 and 300 basis points and/or
structured as interest only payment loans for periods of one to three years. Some of these loans also have balloon payments due
at the end of their lowered rate period, requiring the borrower to refinance at market rates at that time. At September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016, all loans classified as TDRs required principal and interest payments. 

The following table shows the aggregate
amounts of our classified loans at the dates indicated.

The following table sets forth the allocation
of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated. 

Liquidity Management .  Liquidity
is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of
deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. While maturities
and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly
influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 

We regularly adjust our investments in
liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows, in particular municipal deposit
flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management
policy. 

Our most liquid assets are cash and cash
equivalents. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given
period. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $28.2 million at September 30, 2016 and $29.0 million at June 30, 2016. Securities classified
as available-for-sale whose market value exceeds our cost, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $95.2 million
at September 30, 2016. Total securities classified as available-for-sale were $115.9 million at September 30, 2016. 

In addition, at September 30, 2016, we
had the ability to borrow a total of approximately $61.4 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. 

At September 30, 2016, we had $45.9 million
in loan commitments outstanding, consisting of $9.3 million in mortgage loan commitments, $26.2 million in unused home equity
lines of credit, $7.5 million in commercial lines of credit and $2.9 million in other loan commitments. Certificates of deposit
due within one year of September 30, 2016 totaled $80.1 million. This represented 58.0% of certificates of deposit at September
30, 2016. We believe that the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers 
hesitancy to invest their funds for longer periods in the current low interest rate environment.   If these maturing deposits
do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funding, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings.
Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently
pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2016. However, based on past experience, we believe that a significant
portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the
interest rates offered. 

Our primary investing activities are the
origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of investment securities. Our primary financing activities consist of activity
in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the
interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. We generally manage the pricing of our
deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships. Occasionally, we offer promotional rates on certain deposit
products to attract deposits. 

Capital Management.   United
Community Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, including a risk-based capital measure.
The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by
assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At September 30, 2016, we exceeded all of
our regulatory capital requirements and we are considered  well capitalized  under regulatory guidelines. See   Regulation
and Supervision Regulation of Federal Savings Associations Capital Requirements ,  and Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8, to the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
September 27, 2016. 

The following table summarizes the Bank s
capital amounts and the ratios required at September 30, 2016: 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  
In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements
of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding
and take the form of loan commitments, letters of credit and lines of credit. We currently have no plans to engage in hedging
activities in the future. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  

For a discussion of the Company s
asset and liability management policies as well as the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of the
Company s portfolio equity, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September
27, 2016. The main components of market risk for the Company are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We manage the interest
rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects
of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates
than loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect
our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility volatility
of our earnings, we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable
interest rate spread. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes: adjusting the maturities of borrowings; adjusting
the investment portfolio mix and duration; and generally, selling in the secondary market newly originated conforming fixed-rate
15-, 20- and 30-year one-to four-family residential real estate loans and available-for-sale securities. We currently do not participate
in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments. 

We have an Asset/Liability Committee, comprised
of Board members, to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management. The committee establishes
and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding
sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. 

We use an economic value of equity analysis
prepared by a consulting firm to review our level of interest rate risk. This analysis measures interest rate risk by computing
changes in net economic value of our cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of
assumed changes in market interest rates. Economic value of equity represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal
to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. These
analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk-sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 400 basis
point increase or a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to steps that we might take to counter
the effects of that interest rate movement. Because of the low level of market interest rates, these analyses are not performed
for decreases of more than 100 basis points. 

The following table presents the change
in our net economic value of equity at June 30, 2016, the most recently completed date, that would occur in the event of an immediate
change in interest rates, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change. 

The interest rate risk management model
uses various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk. These most critical assumptions relate to interest rates, deposit decay
rates, deposit beta factors, loan prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and market interest rates, among others. As with any
method of measuring interest rate risk involving forecasting, certain shortcomings are inherent in the calculations. Borrower
and depositor behavior in the future is unknown. Historical data has been compiled and analyzed, where available, to allow the
Company to see the impact of customer behavior in prior interest rate cycles. However, the future behavior is inherently unknown.
For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing dates, they may react in different
degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate
in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally,
certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term
basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans
and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Prepayment rates
can have a significant impact on interest income. Because of the volume of loans and mortgage-backed securities we hold, increasing
or decreasing interest rates could have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn could
affect the rate sensitivity position. When market interest rates increase, prepayments tend to slow. When market interest rates
decrease, prepayments tend to rise. While the Company believes the assumptions used in the model to be reasonable, there can be
no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage-backed security and loan prepayment activity. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

The Company s management, including the Company s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure
controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, (the  Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) (1) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, there
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting which materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal
                                         Proceedings  

Periodically, there have been various claims
and lawsuits against us, such as claims to enforce liens and contracts, condemnation proceedings on properties in which we hold
security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other issues incident to our business.
We are not party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
