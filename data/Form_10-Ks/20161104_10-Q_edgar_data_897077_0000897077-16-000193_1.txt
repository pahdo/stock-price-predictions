  Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - (Unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016    

1.  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Alamo Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulations S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This update is effective as of January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017. This update could impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized. We are evaluating the effects, if any, that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet selected a transition approach to implement the standard. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  as part of its simplification initiative.  ASU 2015-11 amends existing guidance for measuring inventories.  This amendment will require the Company to measure inventories recorded using the first-in, first-out method at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  This amendment does not change the methodology for measuring inventories recorded using the last-in, first-out method.  This amendment will be effective prospectively for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases.  This update requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Similar to current guidance, the update continues to differentiate between finance leases and operating leases, however this distinction now primarily relates to differences in the manner of expense recognition over time and in the classification of lease payments in the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance leaves the accounting for leases by lessors largely unchanged from existing GAAP. Early application is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective adoption, with certain relief provisions, for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements when adopted. The guidance will become effective for us on January 1, 2019. The impacts that adoption of the ASU is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are being evaluated. Additionally, we have not determined the effect of the ASU on our internal control over financial reporting or other changes in business practices and processes. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation,  to simplify the accounting and reporting for employee share-based payments. This amendment involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes as it pertains to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized and to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statements of income, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of  
  
    8 

excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid in the statement of cash flows. This amendment will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments provide specific transition and disclosure guidance for each provision. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.   
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,  to improve information on credit losses for financial instruments. The ASU replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses.  The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted beginning in fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2018. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  to address diversity in practice on certain specific cash flow issues. The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements.  

2.  Accounting Policies 
    
  There have been no changes or additions to our significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s   2015   10-K. 

3.  Accounts Receivable 
    
   Accounts receivable is shown net of sales discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   the Company had   $13,000,000   in reserves for sales discounts compared to   $15,094,000   at   December 31, 2015   on products shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.  The decrease was primarily due to additional discounts taken on the Company's agricultural products during the pre-season, which runs from August to December of each year and orders are shipped through the second quarter of 2016. The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.  
    
  The allowance for doubtful accounts was   $3,380,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   $3,484,000   at   December 31, 2015  .

4.  Inventories 
    
   Inventories valued at LIFO cost represented   49%   and   45%   of total inventory at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The excess of current cost over LIFO valued inventories was approximately   $8,712,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.  Accordingly, interim LIFO must necessarily be based, to some extent, on management's estimates at each quarter end. Net inventories consist of the following: 

Inventory obsolescence reserves were   $7,703,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   $9,675,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in reserve for obsolescence resulted from the Company's write-off of previously reserved inventory. 

5.  Rental Equipment 
    
  Rental equipment is shown net of accumulated depreciation of   $9,667,000   and   $8,322,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company recognized depreciation expense of   $1,508,000   and   $2,018,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively and   $4,951,000   and   $5,683,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

6.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The carrying values of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying value of our debt approximates the fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as the floating rates on our outstanding balances approximate current market rates. This conclusion was made based on Level 2 inputs. 

7.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  The following is the summary of changes to the Company's Goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $75,883,000   of goodwill, which represents   12%   of total assets. 

10 

The following is a summary of the Company's definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets net of the accumulated amortization: 

The Company recognized amortization expense of   $779,000   and   $776,000   for the three months ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $2,328,000   and   $2,339,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $50,921,000   of intangible assets, which represents   8%   of total assets.   

8. Warranty 
    
   Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months  expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months  sales with a   ninety  -day to   six  -month lag period. The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately   90   days to   six   months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim. A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group. Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required. 
    
  The current liability warranty reserve balance was   $5,235,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   $5,566,000   at   December 31, 2015   and is included in Accrued liabilities on the Balance Sheet.  The decrease was mainly from the Company's U.S. Operations. 

11 

9.  Debt 
    
  The components of long-term debt are as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1,311,000   of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts, resulting in   $114,689,000   in available borrowings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Agreement. 

10.  Common Stock and Dividends 
    
    Dividends declared and paid on a per share basis were as follows: 

On October 3, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.09    per share, which was paid on October 28, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2016. 

11.  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
   The Company s stock-based compensation expense was   $351,000   and   $296,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $1,075,000   and   $762,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

12 

12.  Earnings Per Share 
    
   The following table sets forth the reconciliation from basic to diluted average common shares and the calculations of net income per common share.  Net income for basic and diluted calculations do not differ. 

13.  Segment Reporting 
    
   At   September 30, 2016   the following includes a summary of the unaudited financial information by reporting segment:  

13 

14.  Contingent Matters 
        
  Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and off-site disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future. Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof. 
    
  The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time. The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006. The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance. We requested a  no further action  classification from the state. We received a conditional  no further action  letter in January of 2009. When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, we will request an unconditional  no further action  letter. 
    
  Alamo Group Inc. and Bush Hog, Inc. were added as defendants in 2013 to litigation by Deere   Company as plaintiff against Bush Hog, LLC (now Duroc, LLC) and Great Plains Manufacturing Incorporated, in which Deere alleged infringement of a mower-related patent. The jury concluded that not only did the defendants not infringe the patent, but that the patent was invalid as well. The Company expensed   $2,100,000   in legal fees related to this lawsuit in 2013. Deere   Company appealed and requested a new trial.  A hearing on the appeal was held on October 8, 2015. On May 26, 2016 the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court ruling and validating the jury s finding that the defendants did not infringe the patent, and that the Deere   Company patent was invalid.  This matter has been finally adjudicated and is no longer subject to further appeal by Deere   Company or any other parties. 
    
  Certain assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time. The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety. A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements. The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.

15.  Retirement Benefit Plans 
    
  Defined Benefit Plan 
     
  The following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost (gains are denoted with parentheses and losses are not): 

The Company amortizes annual pension expense evenly over four quarters. Pension expense was   $45,000   and   $11,000   the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Pension expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $134,000   and   $33,000   for the   nine   months ending   September 30, 2015  . The Company is not required to contribute to the pension plans for the   2016   plan year but may do so.  
    
  On April 6, 2016 we notified all participants in the Gradall Company Hourly Employees  Pension Plan of our decision to terminate the plan.  Participants in the plan will not lose any benefits but will be given a choice between obtaining certain continued annuity benefits that match the benefits offered under the plan or receiving an immediate one-time lump sum payment in total settlement of benefits.  We currently anticipate that we will be able to meet all legal requirements to effectuate a proper termination of the plan on or before December 31, 2016.  
    
  Supplemental Retirement Plan  
    
  In May of 2015, the Board amended the SERP to allow the Board to modify the retirement benefit percentage either higher or lower than   20%  .  In May of 2016, the Board added additional highly compensated employees to the plan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the current retirement benefit (as defined in the plan) for the participants ranges from   10%   to   20%  .  
    
  The net period expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $148,000   and   $150,000  , respectively and   $443,000   and   $450,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data: 

Overview 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on Alamo Group s current expectations.  Actual results in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed below and in the Forward-Looking Information section. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, the Company's net income was up approximately 2.0% when compared to the same period in 2015.  This increase was primarily the result of continued improvement in production efficiencies, lower material costs and control of operating expenses. Negatively influencing both our sales and profits was the effect of the currency translation rates on our non-U.S. results.  Alamo's Industrial Division saw less than a 1.0% decrease in sales for the first nine months of 2016 as sales of mowing, excavator, sweeping equipment and to a lessor extent, snow removal products outperformed the same period in 2015, while sales of vacuum trucks declined during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  Agricultural sales were down in the first nine months of 2016 by 2.1% compared to the first nine months of 2015 as soft market conditions continue to affect the agricultural market. European sales for the first nine months of 2016 were down in U.S. dollars by 8.6% compared to the same period in 2015. Consolidated income from operations was up 6.2% in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The Company's backlog was $137 million at the end of the first nine months of 2016, which was down 21.5% versus the backlog of $175 million at the end of the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in the Company's backlog was primarily attributable to softness in the Industrial Division's vacuum truck orders from non-governmental end users, weak markets in the Agricultural Division and challenging economic conditions and unfavorable foreign currency translation affecting new orders in the European Division, and to a lesser extent, high prior year backlogs of initial orders related to new product introductions.   
    
   The Company believes that its markets for the remainder of 2016 will remain soft and could be negatively affected by a variety of factors such as a continued weakness in the overall economy, sovereign debt issues, credit availability, changes in currency exchange rates, increased levels of government regulations; ongoing weakness in the agricultural sector; changes in farm incomes due to commodity prices or governmental aid programs; adverse situations that could affect our customers such as animal disease epidemics, extreme weather conditions; repercussions from the proposed exit by the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit); budget constraints or revenue

shortfalls in governmental entities and changes in our customers' buying habits due to lack of confidence in the economic outlook. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     
    
  Net sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $216,766,000  , a decrease of   $14,848,000  , or   6.4%   compared to   $231,614,000   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decrease was mainly attributable to weak demand for vacuum trucks, soft agricultural markets, continued weakness in the European economy and currency translation effects all of which continued to negatively impact our sales.  Sales in the Industrial Division were down 4.9% as increased sales of sweepers, mowing equipment and snow removal equipment failed to offset decreased sales of vacuum trucks due to soft non-governmental demand. Sales in the Agricultural Division were down 4.2% during the quarter as continued weakness in the agricultural market and low commodity prices impacted this Division.  European sales were down 13.7% as currency translation rates negatively affected the sales of U.K. and European products. 
    
  Net Industrial sales decreased during the   third   quarter by   $6,180,000   or   4.9%   to   $121,205,000   for   2016   compared to   $127,385,000   during the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was due to softness in the vacuum trucks market to non-governmental end users. Increases in sweepers, excavators, mowing equipment and to a lessor extent, snow removal equipment were not enough to offset the lower vacuum truck sales.   
    
  Net Agricultural sales were   $56,443,000   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $58,919,000   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $2,476,000   or   4.2%  .  Weak agricultural market conditions and low commodity prices continued to negatively affect farm income which limited farmers' ability to purchase new equipment.  
    
  Net European sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $39,118,000  , a decrease of   $6,192,000   or   13.7%   compared to   $45,310,000   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . Just over half of the decrease resulted from changes in currency translation rates which had a negative impact during the quarter. Industrial sales in France were up compared to the third quarter of 2015 as a result of increased sales of Rivard vacuum trucks while sales in the French agricultural markets reflected a slight increase.  U.K. sales were down in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 as demand for mowing products were impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the recent Brexit vote in the U.K. and continued softness in agricultural markets we serve.  
    
  Gross profit for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $54,711,000   (  25.2%   of net sales) compared to   $57,509,000   (  24.8%   of net sales) during the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $2,798,000  .  The decrease in gross profit during the third quarter of 2016 was due to the lower sales volume from all three divisions partially offset by continuous improvement in production efficiencies, as well as lower material costs, which helped drive up margin percent for the quarter. Negatively impacting the gross profit and margin percent during the third quarter of 2015 was $209,000 in higher cost of goods sold related to the step-up in fair value of inventory in the Specialized business units.   
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were   $33,699,000   (  15.5%   of net sales) during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $33,939,000   (  14.7%   of net sales) during the same period of   2015  , a decrease of   $240,000   which relates to a non recurring system conversion in the amount of $341,000 recognized in 2015.   
    
  Interest expense was   $1,405,000   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $1,671,000   during the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $266,000  .  The decrease in   2016   came from lower debt levels during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Other income (expense), net was   $127,000   of income for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $895,000   of income during the same period in   2015  .  The income in   2016   and   2015   were primarily the result of changes in exchange rates.  
                                            
  Provision for income taxes was   $6,541,000   (  33.1%  ) in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $8,065,000   (  35.3%  ) during the same period in   2015  . The decrease in taxes is from lower taxable income in the third quarter of  
  
    17 

2016. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 is primarily related to a lower portion of our taxable income being generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.  
       
  The Company s net income after tax was   $13,236,000   or   $1.14   per share on a diluted basis for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $14,756,000   or   $1.28   per share on a diluted basis for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decrease of   $1,520,000   resulted from the factors described above. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $639,226,000  , a decrease of   $15,920,000   or   2.4%   compared to   $655,146,000   for the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Just over half of the decrease was from currency translation effects. In the Industrial Division, excavators, sweepers, mowing equipment and to a lesser extent, snow removal products were up in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015, however sales of vacuum trucks specifically to non-governmental end users were down due to soft market conditions.  Agricultural Division sales were down 2.1% for the first nine months of 2016 due to a continued weak agricultural market compared to the same period in 2015.  Sales in the European Division were down 8.6% as sales of products manufactured in the U.K. were negatively affected by soft market conditions and currency translation rates which the Company believed was due, in part, to the uncertainty created by the recent Brexit vote in the U.K.  
     
  Net Industrial sales decreased during the first   nine   months by   $1,189,000   or   0.3%   to   $361,629,000   for   2016   compared to   $362,818,000   during the same period in   2015  .  The decrease came from lower vacuum trucks sales to non-governmental end users.  Increased sales from sweeper, excavator, mowing equipment and snow removal equipment product lines were not enough to offset the decline in sales of vacuum truck products.  
    
  Net Agricultural sales were   $156,950,000   during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $160,357,000   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $3,407,000   or   2.1%  .  The decrease in sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first nine months of   2015   was from the continued softness in the overall agricultural market. 
    
  Net European sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $120,647,000  , a decrease of   $11,324,000   or   8.6%   compared to   $131,971,000   during the same period of   2015  .  Over half of the decrease in   2016   was due to the negative affect from currency translation rates. The European Division continued to be faced with challenging market conditions in the U.K.  Rivard vacuum equipment and the French agricultural products had increased sales compared to the first nine months of 2015 from improvements in operational execution. 
    
  Gross profit for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $157,166,000   (  24.6%   of net sales) compared to   $153,711,000   (  23.5%   of net sales) during the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $3,455,000  .  Despite lower sales volume, the gross profit increase was due to continuous improvement in production efficiencies as well as lower material costs.  Negatively affecting both the gross profit and margin percent during the first nine months of 2015 was $2,740,000 in higher cost of goods sold related to the step-up in fair value of inventory in the Specialized business units.   
    
  SG A were   $101,824,000   (  15.9%   of net sales) during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $101,578,000   (  15.5%   of net sales) during the same period of   2015  , an increase of   $246,000  .  The increase in SG A for the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily the result of increased sales commissions and marketing promotion expenses during the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Interest expense was   $4,334,000   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $5,142,000   during the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $808,000  . The decrease in   2016   came from the Company's efforts to reduce our borrowings which resulted in lower interest costs.  
    
  Other income (expense), net was   $(253,000)   of expense during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $2,243,000   of income in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The expense in   2016   and income in   2015   were primarily the result of changes in exchange rates.  
    
  Provision for income taxes was   $18,459,000   (  36.3%  ) in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $17,529,000   (  35.5%  ) during the same period in   2015  .  The increased effective tax rate in 2016 is primarily due to a higher portion of our taxable income being generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates as well as losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions that did not result in a tax benefit. 
  
    18 

The Company's net income after tax was   $32,457,000   or   $2.81   per share on a diluted basis for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $31,825,000   or   $2.77   per share on a diluted basis for the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The increase of   $632,000   resulted from the factors described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company has ongoing cash requirements which are necessary to operate the Company s business, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.  The Company s inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first half of the year and in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the spring and fall selling seasons.  Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of fall preseason sales programs and out of season sales, particularly in our Agricultural Division.  Preseason sales, primarily in the Agricultural Division, help level the Company s production during the off season. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had working capital of   $308,102,000   which represents an increase of   $30,240,000   from working capital of   $277,862,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Capital expenditures were   $7,201,000   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $7,030,000   during the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The Company expects to fund future expenditures from operating cash flows or through its revolving credit facility, described below. 
    
  Net cash used by financing activities was   $10,523,000   and   $15,659,000   during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in net cash used by financing activities in 2016 resulted from a decrease in net repayments under our bank credit facility due to seasonal funding of operations. 
    
  The Company had   $52,314,000   in cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  .  The majority of these funds are at our U.K. and Canadian subsidiaries and would not be available for use in the United States without incurring US federal and state tax consequences.  The Company plans to use these funds for capital expenditures or acquisitions outside the United States.       
    
  The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Agreement").  The aggregate commitments from lenders under the Agreement is   $250,000,000   and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional   $50,000,000  .  The Agreement requires the Company to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum earnings before interest and tax to interest expense ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio. The Agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.  The Agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.  The termination date of the Agreement is May 12, 2019.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $134,000,000   was outstanding under the Agreement. On   September 30, 2016  ,   $1,311,000   of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in   $114,689,000   in available borrowings.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Agreement. 
    
   Management believes the Agreement and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future. However, the challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general could potentially cause changes to credit availability, which creates a level of uncertainty.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.  Management believes that of the Company's significant accounting policies, which are set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Form 10-K"), the policies relating to the business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, sales discounts, inventories-obsolete and slow moving, warranty, and goodwill and other intangible assets involved a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  There have been no material changes to the nature of estimates, assumptions and levels of subjectivity and judgment related to critical accounting estimates disclosed in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  There are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are currently likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition. 
    
  Forward-Looking Information 
    
   Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in Item II of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition, forward-looking statements may be made orally or in press releases, conferences, reports or otherwise, in the future by or on behalf of the Company. 
    
   Statements that are not historical are forward-looking.  When used by or on behalf of the Company, the words  estimate,   believe,   intend , "will", "would", "should", "could" and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. 
    
   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.  These uncertainties include factors that affect all businesses operating in a global market, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves.  Particular risks and uncertainties facing the Company include changes in market conditions; ongoing weakness in the agricultural sector; a strong U.S. dollar; increased competition; decreases in the prices of agricultural commodities, which could affect our customers' income levels; repercussions from the exit by the U.K. from the European Union; budget constraints or income shortfalls which could affect the purchases of our type of equipment by governmental customers; credit availability for both the Company and its customers, adverse weather conditions such as droughts, floods, snowstorms, etc. which can affect buying patterns of the Company s customers and related contractors; the price and availability of critical raw materials, particularly steel and steel products; energy cost; increased cost of new governmental regulations which effect corporations; the potential effects on the buying habits of our customers due to animal disease outbreaks such as mad cow and other epidemics; the Company s ability to develop and manufacture new and existing products profitably; market acceptance of new and existing products; the Company s ability to maintain good relations with its employees; the Company's ability to successfully complete acquisitions and operate acquired businesses or assets; and the ability to hire and retain quality employees. 

20 

In addition, the Company is subject to risks and uncertainties facing the industry in general, including changes in business and political conditions and the economy in general in both domestic and international markets; weather conditions affecting demand; slower growth in the Company s markets; financial market changes including increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; actions of competitors; the inability of the Company s suppliers, customers, creditors, public utility providers and financial service organizations to deliver or provide their products or services to the Company; seasonal factors in the Company s industry; litigation; government actions including budget levels, regulations and legislation, primarily relating to the environment, commerce, infrastructure spending, health and safety; and availability of materials. 
    
   The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and to recognize that the statements are not predictions of actual future results.  Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described above, as well as others not now anticipated.  The foregoing statements are not exclusive and further information concerning the Company and its businesses, including factors that could potentially materially affect the Company s financial results, may emerge from time to time.  It is not possible for management to predict all risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on the Company s businesses. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
    
  The Company is exposed to various market risks.  Market risks are the potential losses arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk         
    
  International Sales 
    
  A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions. The Company primarily manufactures its products in the U.S., U.K., France, Canada, Brazil and Australia.  The Company sells its products primarily in the functional currency within the markets where the products are produced, but certain sales from the Company's U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other foreign currencies.  As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products. 
    
  To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately 90% of its future net foreign currency collections over a period of six months.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1,725,000   outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.  A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value of these contracts by approximately   $259,000  .  However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged. 
    
  Exposure to Exchange Rates 
    
  The Company translates the assets and liabilities of foreign-owned subsidiaries at rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting period. Translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders  equity. The total foreign currency translation adjustment for the current quarter decreased stockholders  equity by   $1,702,000  . 
    
  The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately in European countries, as a result of the sales of its products in international markets.  Forward currency contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.  The result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of   $4,306,000   for the   nine   month period ending   September 30, 2016  .  Comparatively, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of  
  
    21 

approximately   $4,120,000   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.  In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which include a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors  products become more or less attractive.  The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.   
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.  Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.  Assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point change for the   third   quarter   2016   average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s interest expense would have changed by approximately   $670,000  .  In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.  However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no such actions.  Further this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .   
    
  An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Alamo s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and Vice-President and Corporate Controller, (Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based upon the evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and Vice-President, Corporate Controller, (Principal Accounting Officer) concluded that the Company s design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
    
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  I, Ronald A. Robinson, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Alamo Group Inc; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
