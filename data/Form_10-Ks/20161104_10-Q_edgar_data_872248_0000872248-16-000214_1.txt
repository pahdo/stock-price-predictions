  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 
   
  Note 1 Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial information for the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , have been prepared by the Company and were not audited by its independent registered public accountants. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments have been made to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company at   September 30, 2016   and for all reported periods. Results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year or any future periods. 
  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
  Unless the context otherwise indicates, any references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the  Company,  "we," or "us" refer to PetroQuest Energy, Inc. ("PetroQuest") and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, PetroQuest Energy, L.L.C. (a single member Louisiana limited liability company), PetroQuest Oil   Gas, L.L.C. (a single member Louisiana limited liability company), TDC Energy LLC (a single member Louisiana limited liability company) and Pittrans, Inc. (an Oklahoma corporation). 

Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
  Acquisition: 
  In June 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture in Louisiana for an aggregate purchase price of   $24 million  . The assets acquired under the joint venture include an average   37%   working interest in an approximately   30,000   acre leasehold position in Louisiana and exclusive rights, along with the Company's joint venture partner, to a   200   square mile proprietary 3D survey which has generated several conventional and shallow non-conventional oil focused prospects. 
  The purchase price was comprised of   $10 million   in cash and   $14 million   in cash funding for future drilling, completion and lease acquisition costs. At   December 31, 2015  ,   $4.4 million   of this drilling carry remained outstanding and was reflected as accrued acquisition costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  During February 2016, the Company paid   $4.4 million   to settle this liability with its joint venture partner in connection with the terms of the agreement. 
  Divestitures: 
  On   June 4, 2015  , the Company completed the sale of a majority of its interests in the Woodford and Mississippian Lime (the  Sold Assets ) for   $260.2 million  .  At December 31, 2014, the estimated proved reserves attributable to the Sold Assets totaled approximately   227   Bcfe, which represented approximately   57%   of the Company's estimated proved reserves. Under the full cost method of accounting, sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. A significant alteration is generally not expected to occur for sales involving less than 25% of the total proved reserves.  If the divestiture of the Sold Assets was accounted for as an adjustment of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized, the adjustment would have significantly altered the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.  Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of   $22.4 million  .  The carrying value of the properties sold was determined by allocating total capitalized costs within the full cost pool between properties sold and properties retained based on their relative fair values. 
  In March 2016, the Company sold certain non-producing assets in East Texas for   $7 million   in connection with a potential joint venture. This sale was accounted for as an adjustment to the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties. The Company is no longer pursuing a joint venture with this party and will be required to repurchase the non-producing assets for   $5.0 million   on or before   December 31, 2016  .  This purchase obligation is reflected as accrued acquisition costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  On   April 20, 2016  , the Company completed the sale of a majority of its remaining Woodford Shale assets in the East Hoss field (the "East Hoss Assets") for approximately   $18 million  , subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments, effective   April 1, 2016  .  This sale was accounted for as an adjustment to the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties.

Note 3 Equity 
  Common Stock 
    On May 18, 2016, the Company effected a reverse split of the Company's common stock at a ratio of   one   share of newly issued common stock for each   four   shares of issued and outstanding common stock (the "Reverse Split").  The purpose of the Reverse Split was to increase the per share trading price of the Company's common stock in order to regain compliance with the New York Stock Exchange continued listing standards.  The Reverse Split proportionately reduced the total number of outstanding shares of common stock from approximately   70.1 million   shares to approximately   17.5 million   shares. All references in the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements to the number of shares, per share data, restricted stock and stock option data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Split. 
  Convertible Preferred Stock 
  The Company has   1,495,000   shares of   6.875%   Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the  Series B Preferred Stock ) outstanding. 
  The following is a summary of certain terms of the Series B Preferred Stock: 
  Dividends  . The Series B Preferred Stock accumulates dividends at an annual rate of   6.875%   for each share of Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends are cumulative from the date of first issuance and, to the extent payment of dividends is not prohibited by the Company s debt agreements, assets are legally available to pay dividends and the Company s board of directors or an authorized committee of the board declares a dividend payable, the Company pays dividends in cash, every quarter. 
  In connection with an amendment to the Company's bank credit facility prohibiting the Company from declaring or paying dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company suspended the quarterly cash dividend on its Series B Preferred Stock beginning with the dividend payment due on April 15, 2016.  Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, any unpaid dividends will accumulate.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has deferred   two   dividend payments and has accrued a   $3.9 million   payable related to the two deferred payments and the third quarter 2016 dividend that was payable on October 15, 2016, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  If the Company fails to pay   six   quarterly dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, will have the right to elect   two   additional directors to the Company's Board of Directors until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are paid in full. 
  Mandatory conversion  . The Company may, at its option, cause shares of the Series B Preferred Stock to be automatically converted at the applicable conversion rate, but only if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock for   20   trading days within a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date the Company gives the conversion notice equals or exceeds   130%   of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day. 
  Conversion rights  . Each share of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into   0.8608   shares of the Company s common stock (which is based on a conversion price of approximately   $58.08   per share of common stock as adjusted for the Reverse Split, subject to further adjustment) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to the Company s right to settle all or a portion of any such conversion in cash or shares of the Company s common stock.   If the Company elects to settle all or any portion of its conversion obligation in cash, the conversion value and the number of shares of the Company s common stock it will deliver upon conversion (if any) will be based upon a 20 trading day averaging period.    
  Upon any conversion, the holder will not receive any cash payment representing accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not in arrears, except in limited circumstances. The conversion rate is equal to   $50   divided by the conversion price at the time. The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The conversion price on the conversion date and the number of shares of the Company s common stock, as applicable, to be delivered upon conversion may be adjusted if certain events occur.

Note 4 Earnings Per Share 
  A reconciliation between the basic and diluted earnings per share computations (in thousands, except per share amounts) is as follow: 

An aggregate of   0.7 million   and   0.2 million   shares of common stock representing options to purchase common stock and unvested shares of restricted common stock and common shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Series B preferred stock totaling   1.3 million   shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, because the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive as a result of the net loss reported for such periods. 
    
  An aggregate of   0.7 million   and   0.4 million   shares of common stock representing options to purchase common stock and unvested shares of restricted common stock and common shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Series B preferred stock totaling   1.3 million   shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, because the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive as a result of the net loss reported for such periods.

Note 5 Long-Term Debt 
  On August 19, 2010, the Company issued   $150 million   in principal amount of its   10%   Senior Notes due 2017. On July 3, 2013, the Company issued an additional   $200 million   in principal amount of its   10%   Senior Notes due 2017 (collectively, the "2017 Notes").  
  On January 14, 2016, the Company announced the commencement of a private exchange offer (the "February Exchange") and consent solicitation (the "February Consent Solicitation") to certain eligible holders of its outstanding 2017 Notes. The February Exchange closed on   February 17, 2016  , and in satisfaction of the tender of   $214.4 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, representing approximately   61%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, in the February Exchange the Company (i) paid approximately   $53.6 million   of cash, (ii) issued   $144.7 million   aggregate principal amount of its new   10%   Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and (iii) issued approximately   1.1 million   shares of its common stock.  Following the completion of the February Exchange,   $135.6 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remained outstanding.  The February Consent Solicitation eliminated or waived substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the 2017 Notes. 
  On August 25, 2016, the Company announced the commencement of private exchange offers (the "September Exchange") and a consent solicitation (the "September Consent Solicitation") to certain eligible holders of its outstanding 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes.  The September Exchange closed on   September 27, 2016  , and in satisfaction of the consideration of   $113.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, representing approximately   83%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, and   $130.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, representing approximately   90%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, the Company issued (i)   $243.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of its new 10% Second Lien Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2021 (the "2021 PIK Notes") and (ii) approximately   3.5 million   shares of its common stock.  The Company also paid, in cash, accrued and unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes accepted in the September Exchange from the last applicable interest payment date to, but not including,   September 27, 2016  .  Interest on the 2021 PIK Notes will accrue from   September 27, 2016  .  Following the consummation of the September Exchange, there is   $22.7 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes outstanding and   $14.2 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes outstanding.  The September Consent Solicitation amended certain provisions of the indenture governing the 2021 Notes and amended the registration rights agreement with respect to the 2021 Notes. 
  Unless the Company exercises its payable in kind ("PIK") interest option, the 2021 PIK Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%    per annum on the principal amount and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, starting on February 15, 2017. The Company may, at its option, for one or more of the first   three   interest payment dates of the 2021 PIK Notes, pay interest at (i) the annual rate of   1%   per annum in cash plus (ii) the annual rate of   9%   PIK (the "PIK Interest") payable by increasing the principal amount outstanding of the 2021 PIK Notes or by issuing additional 2021 PIK Notes in certificated form.  As of the date hereof, the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 PIK Notes.   
  The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%   per annum on the principal amount and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  As of the date hereof, the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 Notes.   
  The 2017 Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%   per annum on the principal amount and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year and the 2017 Notes mature on September 1, 2017.  On September 23, 2016, the Company made the interest payment that was due on September 1, 2016 with respect to the 2017 Notes, which payment was made prior to the expiration of the   30   day grace period for payment of interest under the indenture governing the 2017 Notes.  As of the date hereof, the Company is in compliance with the remaining covenants under the 2017 Notes. 
  The February Exchange and September Exchange were accounted for as troubled debt restructurings pursuant to guidance provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") section 470-60 "Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors." The Company determined that the future undiscounted cash flows from the 2021 PIK Notes issued in the September Exchange through the maturity date exceeded the adjusted carrying amount of the 2017 Notes and the 2021 Notes tendered in the September Exchange. Accordingly,   no   gain or loss on extinguishment of debt was recognized in connection with the September Exchange. The net shortfall of the remaining carrying value of the 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes tendered as compared to the principal amount of the 2021 PIK Notes issued in the September Exchange of   $0.6 million   is reflected as part of the carrying value of  the 2021 PIK Notes.  Such shortfall will be amortized under the effective interest method as an addition of interest expense over the term of the 2021 PIK Notes.  
  The Company previously determined that the future undiscounted cash flows from the 2021 Notes issued in the February Exchange through the maturity date exceeded the adjusted carrying amount of the 2017 Notes tendered in the February Exchange. Accordingly,   no   gain on extinguishment of debt was recognized in connection with the February Exchange. The excess of the remaining carrying value of the 2017 Notes tendered over the principal amount of the 2021 Notes issued in the February Exchange of   $13.9 million   was reflected as part of the carrying value of  the 2021 Notes.  The amount of the excess carrying value attributable to the 2021 Notes tendered in the September Exchange is now reflected as part of the carrying value of the 2021 PIK Notes, and

will be amortized under the effective interest method as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the 2021 PIK Notes. The excess carrying value attributable to the remaining 2021 Notes is being amortized under the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.2 million    of the excess remained as part of the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the Company recognized   $0.6 million   and   $1.4 million   of amortization expense as a reduction to interest expense during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  The indentures governing the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors of the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes to incur indebtedness; purchase or redeem stock; make certain investments; create liens that secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; refinance certain indebtedness; merge with or into other companies or transfer substantially all of their assets; and, in certain circumstances, to pay dividends or make other distributions on stock.  The 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. 
  The 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes are secured equally and ratably by second-priority liens on substantially all of the Company's and the subsidiary guarantors' oil and gas properties and substantially all of their other assets to the extent such properties and assets secure the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), except for certain excluded assets.  Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement, the security interest in those properties and assets that secure the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes and the guarantees are contractually subordinated to liens that secure the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and certain other permitted indebtedness.  Consequently, the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and such other indebtedness to the extent of the value of such assets. 
  During 2015, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as an asset.  As a result, the 2017 Notes are reflected net of   $0.1 million   and   $3.0 million   of related financing costs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The 2021 Notes are reflected net of   $0.1 million   of related financing costs as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  The following table reconciles the face value of the 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes to the carrying value included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

The Company and PetroQuest Energy, L.L.C. (the  Borrower ) terminated the credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ).  
  On October 17, 2016, the Company entered into the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (the "Multidraw Term Loan Agreement") with Franklin Custodian Funds - Franklin Income Fund ("Franklin"), as a lender, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, replacing the Credit Agreement. The Multidraw Term Loan Agreement provides a multi-advance term loan facility, with borrowing availability for   three   years, in a principal amount of up to   $50 million  . The loans drawn under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (collectively, the  Term Loans ) may be used to repay existing debt, to pay transaction fees and expenses, to provide working capital for exploration and production operations and for general corporate purposes.  
  The Term Loans mature on   October 17, 2020  . As of the date hereof, the Company had   $10 million   of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loans. 
  The Company s obligations under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and the Term Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including a lien on all equipment and at least   90%   of the aggregate total value of the oil and gas properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, a pledge of the equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the Company s other subsidiaries, and corporate guarantees of the Company and certain of the Company s other subsidiaries of the indebtedness of the Borrower. Term Loans under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement bear interest at the rate of   10%   per annum.

Note 7 Ceiling Test 
    
  The Company uses the full cost method to account for its oil and gas properties. Accordingly, the costs to acquire, explore for and develop oil and gas properties are capitalized. Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD A and related deferred taxes, are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved oil and gas reserves, including the effects of cash flow hedges in place, discounted at   10%  , plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, as adjusted for related income tax effects (the full cost ceiling). If capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess is charged to ceiling test write-down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs. 
    
  In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves are based on an average of the first day of the month spot price for a historical 12-month period, adjusted for quality, transportation fees and market differentials. At March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from the Company s estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date, averaged   $2.19  ,   $2.15   and   $2.19   per Mcf of natural gas,   $45.92  ,   $42.12   and   $39.97   per barrel of oil and   $1.91  ,   $1.71   and   $1.66   per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative impact on the Company's estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, the Company recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately   $18.9 million  ,   $12.8 million   and   $8.7 million   during the three months ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company s cash flow hedges in place at March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016   decreased the ceiling test write-downs by approximately   $0.8 million  ,   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  At March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and   September 30, 2015  , the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from the Company's estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date, averaged   $3.31  ,   $3.20

and   $2.89   per Mcf of natural gas,   $81.33  ,   $71.27   and   $59.71   per barrel of oil and   $3.52  ,   $3.35   and   $2.70   per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative impact on the Company's estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, the Company recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately   $108.9 million  ,   $65.5 million   and   $40.2 million   during the three months ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company's cash flow hedges in place at March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 increased the ceiling test write-downs by approximately   $14 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, and the Company's cash flow hedges in place at   September 30, 2015   decreased the ceiling test write-down by approximately   $2.2 million  .  

Note 8 Derivative Instruments 
       
  The Company seeks to reduce its exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of its production through commodity derivative instruments. When the conditions for hedge accounting are met, the Company may designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income (expense). At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's derivative instrument was designated as an effective cash flow hedge. 
  Oil and gas sales include additions (reductions) related to the settlement of gas hedges of   ($144,000)   and   $3,603,000  ,  oil hedges of   $0   and   $299,000   and Ngl hedges of   $0   and   $191,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   Oil and gas sales include additions related to the settlement of gas hedges of   $2,043,000   and   $10,108,000  , oil hedges of   $0   and   $38,000   and Ngl hedges of   $0   and   $348,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had entered into the following commodity derivative instrument: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had recognized an accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately   $0.2 million   related to the estimated fair value of its effective cash flow hedge. Based on estimated future commodity prices as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company would reclassify approximately   $0.1 million  , net of taxes, of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next   three months  . This derivative instrument was terminated in October 2016 and the accumulated other comprehensive loss was recognized in earnings.

Note 9   Fair Value Measurements 
  As defined in ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As presented in the tables below, this hierarchy consists of three broad levels: 
             
    Level 1: valuations consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and has the highest priority; 
                
    Level 2: valuations rely on quoted prices in markets that are not active or observable inputs over the full term of the asset or liability; 
                
    Level 3: valuations are based on prices or third party or internal valuation models that require inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are less observable and thus have the lowest priority. 
     The Company classifies its commodity derivatives based upon the data used to determine fair value. The Company s derivative instrument at   September 30, 2016   was in the form of a swap based on NYMEX pricing for natural gas. The fair value of this derivative is derived using an independent third-party s valuation model that utilizes market-corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract. The Company s fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties  default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of the Company s default risk for derivative liabilities. As a result, the Company designates its commodity derivatives as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following table summarizes the net valuation of the Company s derivatives subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximated book value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The fair value of the 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes was determined based upon market quotes provided by an independent broker, which represents a Level 2 input. The following table summarizes the valuation of the 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

Note 10 Income Taxes 
  The Company typically provides for income taxes at a statutory rate of   35%   adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized, primarily statutory depletion, non-deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes. As a result of  ceiling test write-downs recognized, the Company has incurred a cumulative   three   year loss. Because of the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings, the Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was   $174.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

Note 12 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"), which will require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance.  Public entities are required to adopt ASU 2016-02 for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Overview 
    PetroQuest Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the State of Delaware with primary operations in Texas, Louisiana and the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We seek to grow our production, proved reserves, cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration, development and acquisition activities. From the commencement of our operations through 2002, we were focused exclusively in the Gulf Coast Basin with onshore properties principally in southern Louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico shelf. During 2003, we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties. As part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile, we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects, shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins. 
  Our liquidity position has been negatively impacted by the prolonged decline in commodity prices that began in late 2014. In response to lower commodity prices we have taken the following actions during 2015 and 2016 aimed at preserving liquidity, reducing overall debt levels and extending debt maturities: 
             
    Completed the sale of substantially all of our interests in Oklahoma for   $278 million  ; 
                 
    Suspended the quarterly dividend on our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock saving $5.1 million annually; 
                  
    Entered into a new   $50 million   Multidraw Term Loan Agreement maturing in 2020; and 
                
    Launched a process to secure a drilling joint venture in East Texas. 
     In addition to extending the maturity on approximately   $113 million   of debt due in 2017 to 2021, our September Exchange permits us to reduce our cash interest expense on   $243.5 million   of debt from 10% cash to 1% cash and 9% payment-in-kind for the first three semi-annual interest payments, which is expected to provide us with more than $30 million of cash interest savings during 2017 and 2018. To enhance our liquidity and provide capital to address the remaining 2017 Notes, in October 2016, we entered into a new   $50 million   Multidraw Term Loan Agreement maturing in 2020, replacing our prior bank credit facility which had no borrowing base on the date of termination.  We currently have a more favorable outlook on oil and gas prices for 2017 than what we experienced in 2016.  We expect to recomplete our Thunder Bayou well in South Louisiana into a larger sand package and to finalize our East Texas joint venture and commence the related drilling program before the end of 2016.  As a result, we expect to begin growing production during 2017 as compared to the production expected during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Reserve Estimates 
  Our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. At the end of each year, our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. These estimates, however, represent projections based on geologic and engineering data. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and professional judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies, and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices, future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workover costs. The future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic. Any significant variance in  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves, which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and/or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties. 
  Disclosure requirements under Staff Accounting Bulletin 113 ( SAB 113 ) include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. The rules also allow companies the option to disclose probable and possible reserves in addition to the existing requirement to disclose proved reserves. The disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of third party preparers of reserves and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates. Pricing is based on a 12-month average price using beginning of the month pricing during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the balance sheet to report oil and natural gas reserves. In addition, the 12-month average will also be used to measure ceiling test impairments and to compute depreciation, depletion and amortization. 
  Full Cost Method of Accounting 
  We use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain related employee costs, incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized. Acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire property. Exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells, including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities. Development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions, platforms, facilities and pipelines. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. Sales of oil and gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas. 
  The costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities, unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals, seismic data and capitalized interest. These costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. 
  We compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit-of-production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities. Unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated. In addition to costs associated with evaluated properties, the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non-producing reserves. Our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs, unevaluated costs and proved reserves, and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings. 
  We capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities. The capitalized internal costs include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt. Capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate. 
  Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD A and related deferred taxes, are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges in place, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties, as adjusted for related income tax effects (the full cost ceiling). If capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess is charged to write-down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs. 
  Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term. If oil or gas prices remain at current levels or decline further, even for only a short period of time, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future. 
  Future Abandonment Costs 
  Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology, the timing of estimated costs, the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment.

Derivative Instruments 
  We seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of our production through commodity derivative instruments. The estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.  The changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged oil and natural gas quantities are produced. If a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur, or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income (expense). 
  Our hedges are specifically referenced to NYMEX prices for natural gas. We evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts, and periodically over the life of the contracts, by analyzing the correlation between NYMEX  prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production. Through this analysis, we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the NYMEX prices at which the hedges will be settled. At   September 30, 2016  , our derivative instrument was designated as an effective cash flow hedge. 
  Estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating estimates of future NYMEX prices, discount rates and price movements. As a result, we calculate the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third-party s valuation model that utilizes market-corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract. Our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties  default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities. 
  Results of Operations 
  The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the periods noted. These historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. 

The above sales and average sales prices include increases (decreases) to revenue related to the settlement of gas hedges of   ($144,000)   and   $3,603,000  , oil hedges of   $0   and   $299,000   and Ngl hedges of   $0   and   $191,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  The above sales and average sales prices include increases to revenue related to the settlement of gas hedges of   $2,043,000    and   $10,108,000  , oil hedges of   $0   and   $38,000   and Ngl hedges of   $0   and   $348,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. Please see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10-Q for further details on our hedging program and our current hedging arrangements. 
  Net loss available to common stockholders totaled   $23,306,000   and   $51,910,000   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, while net loss available to common stockholders totaled   $86,586,000   and   $235,233,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The primary fluctuations were as follows: 
  Production   Total production   decreased     30%   and   31%   during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively,  as compared to the   2015   periods. The decreases in total production were primarily the result of the divestment of substantially all of our Oklahoma assets and normal production declines at our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields. Partially offsetting  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

these decreases was the successful completion of our Thunder Bayou discovery, which commenced production in June 2015 as well as successful recompletions and workovers at several of our Gulf of Mexico wells. 
   Due to the low commodity price environment, our capital expenditures budget for 2016 is significantly reduced as compared to 2015. As a result of the substantial decrease in capital spending, combined with our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestments, we expect our total production for the remainder of   2016   to continue to decrease as compared to   2015  . However, we expect to recomplete our Thunder Bayou well into a larger sand package and to finalize our East Texas joint venture and commence the related drilling program before the end of 2016.  As a result, we expect to begin increasing production during 2017 as compared to the production expected during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Gas production during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     32%   and   34%  , respectively, from the comparable periods in   2015  . The decreases were primarily the result of our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestments and normal production declines at our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields. Partially offsetting these decreases was the successful completion of our Thunder Bayou discovery. We expect our average daily gas production to decrease during the remainder of   2016   as compared to   2015   due to our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestments and substantial decrease in capital spending. 
  Oil production during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     10%   from the   2015   period due primarily to normal production declines at our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields.  Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase due to the commencement of production at our Thunder Bayou discovery in June 2015 and successful recompletions and workovers at several of our Gulf of Mexico wells.  As a result of normal production declines and the substantial decrease in capital spending, we expect our average daily oil production to continue to decrease during the remainder of   2016   as compared to   2015  . 
  Ngl production during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     35%   and   30%  , respectively, from the respective   2015   periods primarily due to our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestments and normal production declines at certain of our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields. Additionally, Ngl production declined at several of our fields in the Gulf Coast where we decided to cease processing until prices improve for the residual products.  Offsetting these decreases was the successful completion of our Thunder Bayou discovery. We expect our average daily Ngl production to continue to decrease during the remainder of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to the divestment of the liquids rich portion of our Oklahoma acreage position and substantial decrease in capital spending. 
  Prices   Including the effects of our hedges, average gas prices per Mcf for the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were   $2.70   and   $2.19  , respectively, as compared to   $3.29   and   $2.90   for the respective   2015   periods. Average oil prices per Bbl for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $43.68   and   $38.88  , respectively, as compared to   $49.34   and   $51.27   for the respective   2015   periods and average Ngl prices per Mcfe were   $2.20   and   $1.95   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $2.36   and   $2.68   for the respective   2015   periods. Stated on an Mcfe basis, unit prices received during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   10%   and   21%     lower  , respectively, than the prices received during the comparable   2015   periods. 
  Revenue   Including the effects of hedges, oil and gas sales during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     36%   to   $17,094,000  , as compared to oil and gas sales of   $26,872,000   during the   2015   period.  Including the effects of hedges, oil and gas sales during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     46%   to   $50,238,000  , as compared to oil and gas sales of   $92,873,000   during the   2015   period.  These decreases were primarily the result of   lower   average realized prices for our production during   2016   as well as decreased production as discussed above. 
  Expenses   Lease operating expenses for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $6,857,000   and   $21,898,000  , respectively, as compared to   $10,070,000   and   $32,163,000   during the respective   2015   periods. Per unit lease operating expenses totaled   $1.31   and   $1.16   per Mcfe, respectively, during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $1.35   and   $1.17   per Mcfe during the respective   2015   periods.  Total lease operating expenses decreased during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of our Oklahoma divestitures.  As a result of our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestitures, we expect total lease operating expenses during the remainder of   2016   to decrease as compared to   2015  .  
  Production taxes for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $319,000   and   $609,000  , respectively, as compared to   $399,000   and   $2,303,000  , respectively, during the   2015   periods. Per unit production taxes totaled   $0.06   and   $0.03   per Mcfe, respectively, during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $0.05   and   $0.08   per Mcfe, respectively, during the comparable   2015   periods. The decreases in production taxes were primarily due to lower commodity prices for our production during the   2016   periods as compared to the   2015   periods as severance taxes for the majority of our properties that are subject to severance taxes are assessed on the value of oil and gas sales. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016 we received production tax refunds on certain of our East Texas wells which qualified for a gas tax credit.  As a result of the current commodity pricing environment and lower estimated production as a result of our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestitures, we expect a continued decrease in our total and per unit production taxes during   2016   as compared to   2015  .

General and administrative expenses during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $8,827,000   and   $21,297,000  , respectively, as compared to   $4,686,000   and   $16,544,000   during the   2015   periods. General and administrative expenses during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $5,244,000   and   $10,073,000  , respectively, of costs related to the issuance of the 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes.  ASC Topic 470-60 "Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors" requires financing costs related to a troubled debt restructuring to be expensed in the period incurred.  Offsetting this increase were lower employee related costs, including share-based compensation. Included in general and administrative expenses for the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were share-based compensation costs of   $464,000   and   $1,558,000  , respectively, compared to   $988,000   and   $3,940,000  , respectively, during the   2015   periods. We capitalized   $1,268,000   and   $4,347,000  , respectively, of general and administrative expenses during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,926,000   and   $6,522,000  , respectively, during the   2015   periods. We expect total general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of   2016   to be lower than the comparable   2015   period.  
  Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) expense on oil and gas properties for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $5,851,000  , or   $1.12   per Mcfe, and   $22,815,000  , or   $1.21   per Mcfe, respectively, as compared to   $13,318,000  , or   $1.79   per Mcfe, and   $51,632,000  , or   $1.88   per Mcfe, respectively, during the comparable   2015   periods. The decreases in the per unit DD A rate are primarily the result of the recent ceiling test write-downs. As a result of current year ceiling test write-downs, we expect our DD A rate to be lower for the remainder of   2016  . 
    
  At March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date, averaged   $2.19  ,   $2.15   and   $2.19   per Mcf of natural gas,   $45.92  ,   $42.12   and   $39.97   per barrel of oil and   $1.91  ,   $1.71   and   $1.66   per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative impact on our estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, we recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately   $18.9 million  ,   $12.8 million   and   $8.7 million   during the three months ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Our cash flow hedges in place at March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016   decreased the ceiling test write-downs by approximately   $0.8 million  ,   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.  At March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and   September 30, 2015  , the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date, averaged   $3.31  ,   $3.20   and   $2.89   per Mcf of natural gas,   $81.33  ,   $71.27   and   $59.71   per barrel of oil and   $3.52  ,   $3.35   and   $2.70   per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative impact on our estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, we recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately   $108.9 million  ,   $65.5 million   and   $40.2 million   during the three months ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Our cash flow hedges in place at March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 increased the ceiling test write-downs by approximately   $14 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, and the Company's cash flow hedges in place at   September 30, 2015   decreased the ceiling test write-down by approximately   $2.2 million  . See Note 7,  Ceiling Test  for further discussion of the ceiling test write-downs. Utilizing current strip prices for oil and gas prices for the fourth quarter of 2016 and projecting the effect on the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves as of September 30, 2016, we do not expect to recognize an additional ceiling test write-down in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties, totaled   $7,737,000   and   $22,497,000   during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $8,526,000   and   $24,996,000  , respectively, during the   2015   periods. During the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , our capitalized interest totaled   $167,000   and   $722,000  , respectively, as compared to   $724,000   and   $4,100,000  , respectively, during the   2015   periods. The decrease in interest expense during the 2016 periods was the result of the February Exchange, including a   $1,436,000   non-cash reduction related to the amortization of the excess carrying value of the 2017 Notes tendered in the February Exchange (see Note 5 - Long-Term Debt), as well as the repayment of our bank debt in June 2015. 
  Income tax expense (benefit) during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   ($18,000)   and   $543,000  , respectively, as compared to income tax expense of   $6,000   and   $1,079,000   during the comparable   2015   periods. We typically provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized, primarily statutory depletion, non-deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes.   
  As a result of ceiling test write-downs, we have incurred a cumulative three-year loss. Because of the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings, we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, we established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was   $174,926,000   as of   September 30, 2016  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We have historically financed our acquisition, exploration and development activities principally through cash flow from operations, borrowings from banks and other lenders, issuances of equity and debt securities, joint ventures and sales of assets. However, our liquidity position has been negatively impacted by the prolonged decline in commodity prices that began in late 2014. In response to lower commodity prices we executed a number of transactions during 2015 and 2016 aimed at preserving liquidity, reducing overall debt levels and extending debt maturities. Through these transactions, which included two debt exchanges, we have reduced debt maturing in 2017 from   $350 million   to   $22.7 million   and have reduced total debt   34%   from   $425 million   at December 31, 2014 to   $280.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . In addition to extending the maturity on the majority of our debt due in 2017, our September Exchange permits us to reduce our cash interest expense on   $243.5 million   of debt from 10% cash to 1% cash and 9% payment-in-kind for the first three semi-annual interest payments, which is expected to provide us with more than $30 million of cash interest savings during 2017 and 2018. Finally, in October 2016, we entered into a new   $50 million   Multidraw Term Loan Agreement maturing in 2020, replacing our prior bank credit facility, which had no borrowing base on the date of termination. The Multidraw Term Loan Agreement will provide capital for general corporate purposes, including refinancing the   $22.7 million   of remaining 2017 Notes. For additional information, see "Source of Capital: Debt" below. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a working capital   deficit   of approximately $  36.1 million   as compared to a working capital   surplus   of approximately   $50.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the   $63.7 million   in cash payments made in connection with the February Exchange and September Exchange and the inclusion of the 2017 Notes in current liabilities as discussed in "Source of Capital: Debt" below. 
  Our liquidity may be negatively impacted by federal bonding requirements related to our properties located on the Outer Continental Shelf (the "OCS"). To cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the"BOEM") and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (the "BSEE") generally require that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied.  Because we are not exempt from the BOEM's supplemental bonding requirements, we engage surety companies to post the requisite bonds.  Pursuant to the terms of our surety agreements, we may be required to post collateral at the surety companies' discretion. Two of our surety companies have requested collateral be posted to support certain of the bonds issued on our behalf and to date, we have provided cash deposits totaling $5.2 million to partially satisfy these requests.  The surety companies may request additional collateral which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position. If we fail to satisfy the request for collateral, we may be in default under our agreements with the surety companies, which could cause a cross-default under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and potentially the indentures governing the 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes. In addition, recently updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requirements may increase the amount of surety bonds or other security required to be provided by us. For additional information, see "Item 1A Risk Factors - We may be required to post additional collateral to satisfy the collateral requirements related to the surety bonds that secure our offshore decommissioning obligations or to increase the amount of surety bonds or other security required pursuant to updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requirements". 
  Source of Capital: Operations 
  Net cash flow provided by (used in) operations   decreased   from $  24.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   ($51.7) million   during the   2016   period. The   decrease   in operating cash flow during   2016   as compared to   2015   is primarily attributable to decreases in oil and gas revenues as well as the timing of payment of payables based on operational activity. 
  Source of Capital: Divestitures 
  We do not budget for property divestitures; however, we are continuously evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives. From time to time we may divest certain assets in order to provide liquidity to strengthen our balance sheet or capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects. We are currently exploring divestment opportunities for certain of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell any of our assets in the future. 
  In June 2015, we sold a majority of our interests in the Woodford and Mississippian Lime fields for cash proceeds of   $260.2 million  . Net proceeds from the sale were used to repay all borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility and increase our cash on hand. In April 2016, we sold the majority of our remaining Woodford Shale assets in Oklahoma for approximately   $18 million  . 
  Source of Capital: Debt 
  On August 19, 2010, we issued   $150 million   in principal amount of our   10%   Senior Notes due 2017. On July 3, 2013, we issued an additional   $200 million   in principal amount of our   10%   Senior Notes due 2017 (collectively, the "2017 Notes").  
  On January 14, 2016, we announced the commencement of the February Exchange and consent solicitation (the "February Consent Solicitation") to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 2017 Notes.  The February Exchange closed on   February 17, 2016  , and in satisfaction of the tender of   $214.4 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, representing approximately   61%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, in the February Exchange, we (i) paid approximately   $53.6

     Table of Contents  

million   of cash, (ii) issued   $144.7 million   aggregate principal amount of our new 10% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and (iii) issued approximately   1.1 million   shares of our common stock.  Following the completion of the February Exchange,   $135.6 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remain outstanding.  The February Consent Solicitation eliminated or waived substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the 2017 Notes. 
  On August 25, 2016, we announced the commencement of private exchange offers (the "September Exchange") and a consent solicitation (the "September Consent Solicitation") to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes.  The September Exchange closed on   September 27, 2016  , and in satisfaction of the consideration of   $113.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, representing approximately   83%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, and   $130.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, representing approximately   90%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, we issued (i)   $243.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of our new 10% Second Lien Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2021 (the "2021 PIK Notes") and (ii) approximately   3.5 million   shares of our common stock.  We also paid, in cash, accrued and unpaid interest on the 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes accepted in the September Exchange from the last applicable interest payment date to, but not including,   September 27, 2016  .  Interest on the 2021 PIK Notes will accrue from   September 27, 2016  .  Following the consummation of the September Exchange, there is   $22.7 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes outstanding and   $14.2 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes outstanding.  The September Consent Solicitation amended certain provisions of the indenture governing the 2021 Notes and amended the registration rights agreement with respect to the 2021 Notes. 
  Unless we exercise our payable in kind ("PIK") interest option, the 2021 PIK Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%    per annum on the principal amount and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, starting on February 15, 2017. We may, at our option, for one or more of the first three interest payment dates of the 2021 PIK Notes, pay interest at (i) the annual rate of   1%   per annum in cash plus (ii) the annual rate of   9%   PIK (the "PIK Interest") payable by increasing the principal amount outstanding of the 2021 PIK Notes or by issuing additional 2021 PIK Notes in certificated form. As of the date hereof, we expect to exercise our PIK option for the payment due in February 2017 and we are in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 PIK Notes. 
   The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%   per annum on the principal amount and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  As of the date hereof, we are in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 Notes.  The 2017 Notes bear interest at a rate of   10%   per annum on the principal amount and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year and the 2017 Notes mature on September 1, 2017.  As of the date hereof, we are in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2017 Notes. 
   The indentures governing the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the subsidiary guarantors of the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes to incur indebtedness; purchase or redeem stock; make certain investments; create liens that secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; refinance certain indebtedness; merge with or into other companies or transfer substantially all of their assets; and, in certain circumstances, to pay dividends or make other distributions on stock.  The 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
  The 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes are equally and ratably secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' oil and gas properties and substantially all of their other assets to the extent such properties and assets secure the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), except for certain excluded assets.  Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement, the security interest in those properties and assets that secure the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes and the guarantees are contractually subordinated to liens that secure the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and certain other permitted indebtedness.  Consequently, the 2021 PIK Notes and the 2021 Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and such other indebtedness to the extent of the value of such assets. 
  On October 17, 2016, we entered into the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (the  Multidraw Term Loan Agreement ) with Franklin Custodian Funds - Franklin Income Fund, as a lender, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Multidraw Term Loan Agreement replaced our bank credit facility. 
  The Multidraw Term Loan Agreement provides a new multi-advance term loan facility, with borrowing availability for three years, in a principal amount of up to $50 million. The loans drawn under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (collectively, the  Term Loans ) may be used to repay existing debt, to pay transaction fees and expenses, to provide working capital for exploration and production operations and for general corporate purposes.  
  The Term Loans mature on October 17, 2020. As of the date hereof, we had $10 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loans. 
  Our obligations under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and the Term Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets, including a lien on all equipment and at least 90% of the aggregate total value of our oil and gas properties, a pledge of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries, and corporate guarantees. Term Loans under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum.

We are subject to a restrictive financial covenant under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, consisting of maintaining a ratio of (i) the present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of the estimated future net revenues in respect of our oil and gas properties, before any state, federal, foreign or other income taxes, attributable to proved developed reserves, using three-year strip prices in effect at the end of each calendar quarter, including swap agreements in place at the end of each quarter, to (ii) the sum of the outstanding Term Loans and the then outstanding commitments to provide Term Loans, that shall not be less than (a) 1.7 to 1.0 as measured on December 31, 2016, and March 31, 2017, and (b) 2.0 to 1.0 as measured on June 30, 2017, and the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter (the "Coverage Ratio"). 
  Sales of our oil and gas properties outside the ordinary course of business are limited under the terms of the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement. In addition, the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement prohibits us from declaring and paying dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock.  
  The Multidraw Term Loan Agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt, liens, dividends, distributions and redemptions, investments, loans and advances, nature of business, international operations and foreign subsidiaries, leases, sale or discount of receivables, mergers or consolidations, sales of properties, transactions with affiliates, negative pledge agreements, gas imbalances and swap agreements. As of the date hereof, no default or event of default exists under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement including the Coverage Ratio. 
  Source of Capital: Joint Ventures 
  We are currently pursuing a joint venture relative to a portion of our East Texas assets.  In March 2016, we sold certain non-producing assets in East Texas to a potential joint venture partner for   $7.0 million  .  We are no longer pursuing a joint venture with this party and are required to repurchase these assets for   $5.0 million   on or before December 31, 2016.  We expect to repurchase these assets, close the joint venture with different parties and commence drilling prior to the end of 2016.  If consummated, the joint venture would enhance our drilling economics and provide capital to fund a portion of our estimated drilling and completion costs. 
  Use of Capital: Exploration and Development 
  Our   2016   capital expenditure budget, which includes capitalized interest and general and administrative costs, is expected to range between   $15 million   and   $20 million   (which from the midpoint of such range, represents a 73% reduction from our 2015 capital expenditures), of which $12.5 million was incurred during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we funded our capital expenditures with cash on hand. We plan to fund our capital expenditures during the remainder of   2016   with cash on hand as well as proceeds from our Multidraw Term Loan Agreement.  
  Use of Capital: Acquisitions 
  We do not budget for acquisitions; however, we are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our existing asset base or establish positions in new core areas.  
  We expect to finance our future acquisition activities, if consummated, through cash on hand. We may also utilize sales of equity or debt securities, sales of properties or assets or joint venture arrangements with industry partners, if necessary. We cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

  Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We experience market risks primarily in two areas: commodity prices and interest rates. Because our properties are located within the United States, we do not believe that our business operations are exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risks. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. Based on projected sales volumes for the remainder of   2016  , a 10% change in the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production would have a   $1.4   million impact on our revenues. 
  We seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments. In the settlement of a typical hedge transaction, we will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we are required to pay the counterparties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we   received     $2.0 million     from   the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with hedge settlements. 
  We are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price (when the floating price exceeds the fixed price) regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. Significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production. Hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge. 
  Our Multidraw Term Loan Agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be rated A-/A3 or higher by S P or Moody's. Currently, the counterparty to our existing hedge contract is Shell Trading Risk Management LLC.

  Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded: 
           i. 
    that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and 
              ii. 
    that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Part II 
   
  Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  The Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business, including worker's compensation claims, tort claims and contractual disputes.  Some of the existing known claims against us are covered by insurance subject to the limits of such policies and the payment of deductible amounts by us.  Although we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings with certainty, management believes that the ultimate disposition of all uninsured or unindemnified matters resulting from existing litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or financial position. 
  Other then as set forth below, there have been no significant changes with respect to the legal matters disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

On May 27, 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit filed on behalf of holders of the 2017 Notes in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The lawsuit alleges that, as a result of the February Exchange, the Company violated the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the indenture governing the 2017 Notes and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by benefiting itself and a minority of noteholders who are qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs"). According to the lawsuit, as a result of the February Exchange in which only QIBs (and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S) were eligible to participate, the Company unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by reducing indebtedness, extending the maturity date of its long term debt and reducing the value of the 2017 Notes. The lawsuit seeks damages and attorney's fees, in addition to declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens created for the benefit of the 2021 Notes are null and void and that the debt exchange effectively resulted in a default under the indenture for the 2017 Notes.  In August 2016, the lawsuit was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. 
  On October 11, 2016, the Company s subsidiary, PetroQuest Energy, L.L.C. ( PQ LLC ), and another exploration and production company were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit filed on behalf of royalty owners in the state district court in Hughes County, Oklahoma.  The lawsuit alleges that PQ LLC and the other defendant failed to pay interest with respect to untimely royalty payments.  The lawsuit seeks actual and punitive damages, an accounting, disgorgement, injunctive relief and attorney's fees.  
  On October 25, 2016, PQ LLC and another exploration and production company were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit filed on behalf of royalty owners in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma.  The lawsuit alleges that PQ LLC and the other defendant underpaid royalties or did not pay royalties by various means.  The lawsuit seeks actual, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees.  
  We continue to vigorously defend against each of these claims. At this time we are unable to express an opinion with respect to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or provide an estimate of potential losses, if any. 
   
  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and an extended decline in the prices of oil and natural gas would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations. 
  Our future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability and future growth, and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily on the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms also substantially depends upon oil and natural gas prices. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and oil prices have been significantly depressed since the end of 2014 as demonstrated by the SEC pricing for the value of crude oil and natural gas, which has decreased significantly as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2014.  For example, the SEC pricing at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 for crude oil (WTI Cushing)  was $50.28  and $41.53 per Bbl, respectively, and natural gas (Henry Hub) was $2.58 and $2.28 per MMBtu, respectively, as compared to $94.99 per Bbl to a low of $4.35 per MMBtu for crude oil and natural gas, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we will receive for our production, and the levels of our production, will depend on numerous factors beyond our control. 
  These factors include: 
             
    relatively minor changes in the supply of or the demand for oil and natural gas; 
                
    the condition of the United States and worldwide economies; 
                
    market uncertainty; 
                
    the level of consumer product demand; 
                
    weather conditions in the United States, such as hurricanes; 
                
    the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; 
                
    domestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxes, including price controls adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; 
                
    political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; 
                
    the price and level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and 
                
    the price and availability of alternate fuel sources. 
     
   25 

     Table of Contents  

We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices and such prices may decline further. An extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has, and may continue to, adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations. Lower prices have reduced and may further reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and has required and will likely require us to record additional ceiling test write-downs and may cause our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 to decline compared to our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices.  
  Our sales are not made pursuant to long-term fixed price contracts. To attempt to reduce our price risk, we periodically enter into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our expected future production. We cannot assure you that we can enter into effective hedging transactions in the future or that such transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices. Any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations. 
  Our outstanding indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness, net of cash on hand, was   $247.2 million  . We currently have $40 million of additional availability under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, subject to compliance with the covenants contained therein.  We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.  Our high level of debt could have important consequences for you, including the following: 
             
    it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, including our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2021 PIK Notes and amounts borrowed under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness; 
                
    the covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business; 
                
    we will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt, approximately $6.1 million per year for interest on our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes alone (assuming we elect our PIK interest option with respect to the first three semi-annual interest payments on the 2021 PIK Notes), and to pay quarterly dividends (which we suspended beginning with the dividend payment due in April 2016), if permissable under the terms of our debt agreements and declared by our Board of Directors, on our Series B Preferred Stock of approximately $5.1 million per year, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities; 
                
    we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage; 
                
    we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and 
                
    our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. 
       
  Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2021 PIK Notes and amounts borrowed under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, including our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2021 PIK Notes and the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

     Table of Contents  

To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2021 PIK Notes and amounts borrowed under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production.  
  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, including our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, including payments on our 2017 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2021 PIK Notes and amounts borrowed under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.  
  Borrowings under the Multidraw Term     Loan Agreement are subject to our compliance with a significant financial ratio. 
  Under the terms of the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, our ability to borrow is based on our maintaining a ratio of (i) the present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of the estimated future net revenues in respect of our oil and gas properties, before any state, federal, foreign or other income taxes, attributable to proved developed reserves, using three-year strip prices in effect at the end of each calendar quarter, including swap agreements in place at the end of each quarter, to (ii) the sum of the outstanding Term Loans and the then outstanding commitments to provide Term Loans, that shall not be less than (a) 1.7 to 1.0 as measured on December 31, 2016, and March 31, 2017, and (b) 2.0 to 1.0 as measured on June 30, 2017, and the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter. We may not be able to comply with this restrictive covenant in the future and, as a result, our ability to borrow money under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement could be limited, in which case we would need to find other sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, negotiated renewals of our borrowings, arranging new financing or selling a portion of our assets. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Restrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. 
  The Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and the indentures governing our 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict or limit our ability to:                      
  pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or issue preferred stock;  
         
  repurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;  
         
  make certain loans and investments;  
         
  place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to make distributions;  
         
  sell assets, including the capital stock of subsidiaries;  
         
  enter into certain transactions with affiliates;  
         
  create or assume certain liens on our assets;  
         
  enter into sale and leaseback transactions;  
         
  merge or enter into other business combination transactions;  
         
  enter into transactions that would result in a change of control of us; or  
         
  engage in other corporate activities.  

Also, the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and the indentures governing our 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios and financial condition tests.  
  Further, these financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and the indentures governing our 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes impose on us. 
  A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required Coverage Ratio or financial condition tests could result in a default under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, the 2021 Notes and the 2021 PIK Notes. A default, if not cured or waived, could result in all indebtedness outstanding under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, the 2021 Notes and the 2021 PIK Notes to become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt or proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such defaulted debt.  
  Our hedging program may limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices or may result in losses or may be inadequate to protect us against continuing and prolonged declines in commodity prices. 
  We enter into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. Our hedge as of October 31, 2016 is in the form of a swap placed with Shell Trading Risk Management LLC. We cannot assure you that this or future counterparties will not become credit risks in the future. Hedging arrangements expose us to risks in some circumstances, including situations when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on the contractual obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received. These hedging arrangements may also limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the market or spot prices for oil and natural gas.  
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total oil and gas sales included additions related to the settlement of gas hedges of   $2.0 million  , oil hedges of zero and Ngl hedges of zero, which in total represented 4% of our total oil and gas sales  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

for the year. We cannot assure you that the hedging transaction we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.  In addition, at October 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.8 Bcf of gas volumes hedged for 2017.  This hedge may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in oil and natural gas prices.  To the extent that oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or decline further, we will not be able to hedge future production at the same pricing level as our current hedge and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.  
  We may be required to post additional collateral to satisfy the collateral requirements related to the surety bonds that secure our offshore decommissioning obligations.  
  To cover the costs for various obligations of lessees on the OCS, including costs for such decommissioning obligations as the plugging of wells, the removal of platforms and other facilities, the decommissioning of pipelines and the clearing of the seafloor of obstructions typically performed at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that the lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such obligations will be met. Failure to post the requisite bonds or otherwise satisfy the BOEM s security requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
  Because we are not exempt from the BOEM's supplemental bonding requirements, we engage surety companies to post the requisite bonds.  Pursuant to the terms of our surety agreements, we may be required to post collateral at the surety companies' discretion. Two of our surety companies have requested collateral be posted to support certain of the bonds issued on our behalf.  To date, we have provided cash deposits totaling $5.2 million to partially satisfy these requests.  The surety companies may request additional collateral which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position. If we fail to satisfy the request for collateral, we may be in default under our agreements with the surety companies, which could cause a cross-default under the indentures governing the 2021 Notes and the 2021 PIK Notes and our Multidraw Term Loan Agreement 
   In addition, on July 14, 2016, the BOEM issued a notice to lessees to clarify the procedures and criteria that the BOEM will use to determine if and when additional security is required for OCS leases. This notice, which became effective on September 12, 2016, may result in an increase to the amount of surety bonds or other security required to be posted by us pursuant to these updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requirements.  
  We can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases given these new expenses and updated BOEM requirements, and if we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds or the increased amount of required collateral as requested, the BOEM may require any or all of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or canceled or otherwise impose monetary penalties, and any one or more of such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
  Lower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations. 
  We use the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop oil and natural gas properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a  full cost ceiling  which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unevaluated properties. If at the end of any fiscal period we determine that the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceed the full cost ceiling, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings in the period then ended. This is called a  ceiling test write-down.  This charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce our net income and stockholders' equity. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date. 
  We review the net capitalized costs of our properties quarterly, using a single price based on the beginning of the month average of oil and natural gas prices for the prior 12 months. We also assess investments in unevaluated properties periodically to determine whether impairment has occurred. The risk that we will be required to recognize further write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unevaluated property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. As a result of the decline in commodity prices, we recognized ceiling test write-downs totaling approximately $266.6 million and   $40.3 million   during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Utilizing current strip prices for oil and gas prices for the fourth quarter of 2016 and projecting the effect on the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves as of September 30, 2016, we do not expect to recognize an additional ceiling test write-down in the fourth quarter of 2016.

We are the subject of putative class action lawsuits that may result in substantial expenditures and divert management's attention. 
  We are the subject of a putative securities class action lawsuit with respect to the February Exchange and two putative class actions lawsuits in Oklahoma with respect to the alleged failure to pay interest with respect to untimely royalty payments and with respect to the alleged underpayment or failure to pay royalties by various means.  These lawsuits seek various remedies, including damages, injunctive relief and attorney s fees.  For additional information on these lawsuits, see Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-Q.   
  Although we believe that the allegations in these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend such litigation vigorously, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in one of these lawsuits or other matters that may arise from time to time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Defending the lawsuits may be costly and, further, could require significant involvement of our senior management and may divert management's attention from our business and operations. 
  The terms of our debt agreements currently restrict and Delaware law may restrict us from making cash payments with respect to our Series B Preferred Stock. 
  Quarterly dividends and cash payments upon conversion or repurchase of our Series B preferred stock will be paid only if payment of such amounts is not prohibited by our debt agreements, such as the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, and assets are legally available to pay such amounts. Quarterly dividends will only be paid if such dividends are declared by our board of directors. The board of directors is not obligated or required to declare quarterly dividends even if we have funds available for such purposes. 
  The terms of the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement currently restrict us from paying cash dividends on our Series B preferred stock. We previously suspended the cash dividend on our Series B preferred stock beginning with the dividend payment due on April 15, 2016. Under the terms of the Series B preferred stock, any unpaid dividends will accumulate. If we fail to pay six quarterly dividends on the Series B preferred stock, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Series B preferred stock, voting as a single class, will have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B preferred stock are paid in full. We plan to periodically re-evaluate the dividend payment policy, subject to the terms of our term loan facility.  
  If in the future we are permitted to pay such cash dividends under the terms of our existing debt agreements, including the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement, and any debt agreements that we enter into in the future, we may continue to be limited in our ability to pay cash dividends on our Series B preferred stock and our ability to make any cash payment upon conversion or repurchase of our Series B preferred stock by the terms of such debt agreements. Furthermore, if we are in default under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement or the indentures governing the 2021 Notes or the 2021 PIK Notes, we will not be permitted to pay any cash dividends on our Series B preferred stock or make any cash payment upon conversion or repurchase of our Series B preferred stock in the absence of a waiver of such default or an amendment or refinancing of such debt agreements. 
  Delaware law provides that we may pay dividends on our Series B preferred stock only to the extent that assets are legally available to pay such dividends. Cash payments we may make upon repurchase or conversion of our Series B preferred stock would be generally subject to the same restrictions under Delaware law. Legally available assets is defined as the amount of surplus. Our surplus is the amount by which the fair value of total assets exceeds the sum of:
